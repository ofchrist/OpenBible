# Open Bible
A free and open source translation of The Bible.

This Bible translation was generated using an A.I. model (GPT 3.5 Turbo) from OpenAI. The original text used to derive each verse was sourced from the King James Version of The Bible provided by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10). Essentially, the model was prompted to merely update the text to use more contemporary english.

Currently, this translation has not been extensively reviewed, and as such, is specifically open for review. To raise an issue, please utilize the [Issues](https://github.com/ofchrist/OpenBible/issues) tab, where issues, concerns, and suggestions may be addressed.

To view the files, you can either download the repository/files, which allows for more flexibility, or when trying to view them here, be sure to click on "View raw", as the files are too big to automatically display on this site. For those unfamiliar with using repositories, simply click on the green `<> Code` button up and to the right, then select "Download Zip".
