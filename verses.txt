1:1:1/In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
1:1:2/The earth was formless and empty; darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
1:1:3/Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
1:1:4/God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
1:1:5/God named the light "Day" and the darkness "Night." The evening passed and the morning came, marking the first day.
1:1:6/Then God said, "Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth."
1:1:7/So God made the space and separated the water under the space from the water above it. And it happened just like that.
1:1:8/God called the space "Sky." The evening passed and the morning came, marking the second day.
1:1:9/Then God said, "Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground may appear." And that is what happened.
1:1:10/God called the dry ground "Land" and the gathered waters "Seas." And God saw that it was good.
1:1:11/Then God said, "Let the land sprout with vegetation—every sort of seed-bearing plant, and trees that grow seed-bearing fruit. These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came." And that is what happened.
1:1:12/The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seeds according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
1:1:13/The evening passed and the morning came, marking the third day.
1:1:14/Then God said, "Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.
1:1:15/Let these lights in the sky shine down on the earth." And that is what happened.
1:1:16/God made two great lights—the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars.
1:1:17/God set these lights in the sky to light the earth,
1:1:18/to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
1:1:19/The evening passed and the morning came, marking the fourth day.
1:1:20/Then God said, "Let the waters swarm with fish and other life. Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind."
1:1:21/So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, and every sort of bird—each producing offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
1:1:22/Then God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply. Let the fish fill the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."
1:1:23/The evening passed and the morning came, marking the fifth day.
1:1:24/Then God said, "Let the earth produce every sort of animal, each producing offspring of the same kind—livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and wild animals." And that is what happened.
1:1:25/God made all sorts of wild animals, livestock, and small animals, each able to produce offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
1:1:26/Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on the earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."
1:1:27/So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
1:1:28/Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground."
1:1:29/Then God said, "Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food.
1:1:30/And to all the animals of the earth, all the birds in the sky, and all the creatures that crawl on the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food." And that is what happened.
1:1:31/Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very good. The evening passed and the morning came, marking the sixth day.
1:2:1/So the heavens and the earth were completed, along with everything in them.
1:2:2/By the seventh day, God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day, he rested from all his work.
1:2:3/God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
1:2:4/These are the origins of the heavens and the earth when they were created, at the time when the LORD God made the earth and heavens,
1:2:5/Before any plant of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown. For the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no one to work the soil.
1:2:6/But streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
1:2:7/Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
1:2:8/The LORD God planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.
1:2:9/And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
1:2:10/A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
1:2:11/The name of the first is Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
1:2:12/And the gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.
1:2:13/The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
1:2:14/The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
1:2:15/The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
1:2:16/And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;
1:2:17/but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it, you will certainly die."
1:2:18/Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
1:2:19/Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
1:2:20/So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
1:2:21/So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.
1:2:22/Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
1:2:23/The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man."
1:2:24/That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.
1:2:25/Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
1:3:1/Now the serpent was more cunning than any animal of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden?"
1:3:2/And the woman said to the serpent, "We can eat the fruit from the trees in the garden:
1:3:3/But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, 'You must not eat it or even touch it, or you will die.'"
1:3:4/And the serpent said to the woman, "You will not actually die:
1:3:5/For God knows that when you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil."
1:3:6/When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eye, and desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
1:3:7/Then both of their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
1:3:8/And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
1:3:9/And the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, "Where are you?"
1:3:10/He said, "I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."
1:3:11/And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
1:3:12/The man said, "The woman You put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."
1:3:13/Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
1:3:14/And the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all livestock and all wild animals; you will crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.
1:3:15/And I will cause hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."
1:3:16/To the woman He said, "I will greatly increase your pain in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
1:3:17/To Adam He said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.
1:3:18/It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
1:3:19/By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."
1:3:20/Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.
1:3:21/The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
1:3:22/Then the LORD God said, "Look, the human has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."
1:3:23/So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
1:3:24/Thus He expelled the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
1:4:1/Adam was intimate with Eve, his wife; she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the LORD."
1:4:2/Then she gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel took care of sheep, while Cain worked the soil.
1:4:3/As time went on, Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.
1:4:4/Abel also brought an offering—the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
1:4:5/But on Cain and his offering, he did not look with favor. Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
1:4:6/The LORD asked Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?
1:4:7/If you do what is right, won't you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."
1:4:8/Cain spoke to Abel, his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain attacked Abel, his brother, and killed him.
1:4:9/Then the LORD asked Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?" He replied, "I don't know. Am I my brother's guardian?"
1:4:10/And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground.
1:4:11/Now you are cursed and cut off from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
1:4:12/When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."
1:4:13/Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear.
1:4:14/Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
1:4:15/But the LORD said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." And the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
1:4:16/So Cain left the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
1:4:17/Cain was intimate with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain then built a city and named it after his son, Enoch.
1:4:18/To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
1:4:19/Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
1:4:20/Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
1:4:21/His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all who play the harp and flute.
1:4:22/And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.
1:4:23/Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
1:4:24/If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
1:4:25/Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."
1:4:26/To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the LORD.
1:5:1/This is the record of Adam's descendants. On the day God created humans, He made them to resemble Himself.
1:5:2/He created them male and female, blessed them, and named them "Human" on the day they were created.
1:5:3/Adam lived 130 years and had a son who looked like him, whom he named Seth.
1:5:4/After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:5/Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.
1:5:6/Seth lived 105 years and then had Enos.
1:5:7/After Enos was born, Seth lived 807 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:8/Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.
1:5:9/Enos lived 90 years and then had Cainan.
1:5:10/After Cainan was born, Enos lived 815 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:11/Enos lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.
1:5:12/Cainan lived 70 years and then had Mahalaleel.
1:5:13/After Mahalaleel was born, Cainan lived 840 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:14/Cainan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.
1:5:15/Mahalaleel lived 65 years and then had Jared.
1:5:16/After Jared was born, Mahalaleel lived 830 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:17/Mahalaleel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.
1:5:18/Jared lived 162 years and then had Enoch.
1:5:19/After Enoch was born, Jared lived 800 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:20/Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.
1:5:21/Enoch lived 65 years and then had Methuselah.
1:5:22/After Methuselah was born, Enoch walked faithfully with God for 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:23/Enoch lived a total of 365 years.
1:5:24/Enoch walked faithfully with God, and then he disappeared because God took him away.
1:5:25/Methuselah lived 187 years and then had Lamech.
1:5:26/After Lamech was born, Methuselah lived 782 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:27/Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.
1:5:28/Lamech lived 182 years and then had a son.
1:5:29/He named him Noah, saying, "He will bring us relief from our work and the painful labor of farming the land cursed by the Lord."
1:5:30/After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:31/Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.
1:5:32/When Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
1:6:1/When people began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,
1:6:2/the sons of God noticed that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.
1:6:3/Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years."
1:6:4/In those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them, they were the heroes of old, men of renown.
1:6:5/And God saw that the wickedness of humans was great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil all the time.
1:6:6/The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.
1:6:7/So the LORD said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them."
1:6:8/But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
1:6:9/These are the records of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.
1:6:10/Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
1:6:11/Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.
1:6:12/God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
1:6:13/So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
1:6:14/Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
1:6:15/This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
1:6:16/Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, second and third decks.
1:6:17/I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.
1:6:18/But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.
1:6:19/You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
1:6:20/Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.
1:6:21/You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."
1:6:22/Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
1:7:1/And the LORD said to Noah, "Come into the ark, you and your entire family, because I have seen that you are righteous in this generation."
1:7:2/"You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and its female, and two of every animal that is not clean, a male and its female."
1:7:3/"Also, take seven pairs of birds of the air, male and female, to keep their species alive on the face of the earth."
1:7:4/"In seven days, I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."
1:7:5/And Noah did everything that the LORD commanded him.
1:7:6/Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
1:7:7/Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
1:7:8/Of clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that crawls on the ground,
1:7:9/they went into the ark with Noah, two by two, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
1:7:10/After seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth.
1:7:11/In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
1:7:12/And it rained on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
1:7:13/On that very day, Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons entered the ark with them.
1:7:14/They, and every kind of wild animal, all the livestock, every creature that crawls on the earth, and every bird, everything with wings.
1:7:15/They went into the ark with Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
1:7:16/Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed it behind him.
1:7:17/The flood continued forty days on the earth, and the waters increased and lifted the ark high above the earth.
1:7:18/The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
1:7:19/The waters rose greatly on the earth, covering all the high mountains under the entire heavens.
1:7:20/The waters rose fifteen cubits above the mountains, covering them.
1:7:21/Every living thing that moved on the earth perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
1:7:22/Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
1:7:23/Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
1:7:24/And the waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
1:8:1/And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark: and God caused a wind to blow across the earth, and the waters began to go down;
1:8:2/The sources of water from deep within the earth and the floodgates of the skies were closed, and the rain from the skies was stopped;
1:8:3/And the waters receded from the earth steadily: and after 150 days, the waters had decreased.
1:8:4/And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.
1:8:5/And the waters continued to decrease until the tenth month: on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
1:8:6/After forty days, Noah opened the window he had made in the ark:
1:8:7/And he sent out a raven, which kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.
1:8:8/He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground;
1:8:9/But the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, because water covered the surface of the whole earth. He reached out his hand, took her, and brought her back into the ark.
1:8:10/And he waited another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark;
1:8:11/And the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in her beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.
1:8:12/And he waited yet another seven days; and sent out the dove, which did not return to him anymore.
1:8:13/In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering of the ark, looked out, and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
1:8:14/By the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was completely dry.
1:8:15/And God spoke to Noah, saying,
1:8:16/Leave the ark, you and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.
1:8:17/Bring out with you every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creature that moves on the ground; so they can breed abundantly on the earth, be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.
1:8:18/So Noah came out, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives.
1:8:19/Every animal, every creature that crawls, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, according to their kinds, came out of the ark.
1:8:20/And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
1:8:21/And the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma; and the LORD said in his heart, I will never again curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And I will never again destroy all living creatures, as I have done.
1:8:22/As long as the earth endures, planting and harvesting, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.
1:9:1/And God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth."
1:9:2/Every creature on earth, every bird in the sky, everything that moves on the ground, and all the fish in the sea will fear and dread you. They are all given into your hands.
1:9:3/You can eat every moving thing that lives, just as I have given you the green plants.
1:9:4/However, you must not eat meat that still has its lifeblood in it.
1:9:5/I will certainly demand an accounting for the lifeblood of your lives. I will require it from every animal and from every human being; from everyone, I will require the life of another human.
1:9:6/Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for God made humans in his own image.
1:9:7/And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it."
1:9:8/Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
1:9:9/"Now, I am establishing my covenant with you and with your descendants after you,
1:9:10/and with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals with you, all that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth.
1:9:11/I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."
1:9:12/And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:
1:9:13/I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
1:9:14/Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
1:9:15/I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
1:9:16/When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."
1:9:17/Then God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth."
1:9:18/The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
1:9:19/These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.
1:9:20/Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard.
1:9:21/He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and lay uncovered inside his tent.
1:9:22/Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.
1:9:23/But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it across their shoulders, walked backward and covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they would not see their father's nakedness.
1:9:24/When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,
1:9:25/he said, "Cursed be Canaan! He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers."
1:9:26/He also said, "Praised be the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
1:9:27/May God extend Japheth's territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be their slave."
1:9:28/And Noah lived 350 years after the flood.
1:9:29/Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
1:10:1/Here are the family lines of Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
1:10:2/Japheth's sons were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
1:10:3/Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
1:10:4/Javan's sons were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
1:10:5/From these, the coastal nations spread out into their territories, each with its own language, by their clans, within their nations.
1:10:6/Ham's sons were Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan.
1:10:7/Cush's sons were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah. Raamah's sons were Sheba and Dedan.
1:10:8/Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a powerful figure on the earth.
1:10:9/He was a mighty hunter in the Lord's sight, which is why people say, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."
1:10:10/The first centers of his kingdom were Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
1:10:11/From that land, Asshur went out and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
1:10:12/and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
1:10:13/Mizraim was the father of the Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
1:10:14/Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.
1:10:15/Canaan was the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,
1:10:16/and the Jebusite, Amorite, Girgasite,
1:10:17/Hivite, Arkite, Sinite,
1:10:18/Arvadite, Zemarite, and Hamathite. Later, the Canaanite clans scattered.
1:10:19/The Canaanite territory stretched from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
1:10:20/These are Ham's sons, by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
1:10:21/Also, to Shem, the ancestor of all the children of Eber and the older brother of Japheth, children were born.
1:10:22/Shem's sons were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
1:10:23/Aram's sons were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
1:10:24/Arphaxad was the father of Salah, and Salah was the father of Eber.
1:10:25/To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother's name was Joktan.
1:10:26/Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
1:10:27/Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
1:10:28/Obal, Abimael, and Sheba,
1:10:29/Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were Joktan's sons.
1:10:30/Their settlements stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
1:10:31/These are Shem's sons, by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
1:10:32/These are the family lines of Noah's sons, according to their generations, within their nations. From these, the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
1:11:1/The entire earth shared the same language and way of speaking.
1:11:2/As they moved from the east, they discovered a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
1:11:3/They said to each other, "Let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used bricks instead of stone and tar for mortar.
1:11:4/Then they said, "Let's build ourselves a city and a tower that reaches the sky, to make a name for ourselves and prevent us from being scattered all over the world."
1:11:5/The LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the humans were building.
1:11:6/And the LORD said, "Look, the people are united, and they all speak the same language. This is just the beginning of what they will do. Now, nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
1:11:7/"Come, let's go down and confuse their language so they won't understand each other."
1:11:8/So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of the entire earth, and they stopped building the city.
1:11:9/That's why it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world, and from there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
1:11:10/These are the descendants of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arphaxad, two years after the flood.
1:11:11/And Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arphaxad, and he had other sons and daughters.
1:11:12/Arphaxad lived thirty-five years and then became the father of Salah.
1:11:13/After he became the father of Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:14/Salah lived thirty years and then became the father of Eber.
1:11:15/After he became the father of Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:16/Eber lived thirty-four years and then became the father of Peleg.
1:11:17/After he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:18/Peleg lived thirty years and then became the father of Reu.
1:11:19/After he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:20/Reu lived thirty-two years and then became the father of Serug.
1:11:21/After he became the father of Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:22/Serug lived thirty years and then became the father of Nahor.
1:11:23/After he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:24/Nahor lived twenty-nine years and then became the father of Terah.
1:11:25/After he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived a hundred and nineteen years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:26/Terah lived seventy years and then became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
1:11:27/These are the descendants of Terah: Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot.
1:11:28/Haran died before his father Terah in his homeland, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
1:11:29/Abram and Nahor both married: Abram's wife was named Sarai, and Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
1:11:30/But Sarai was unable to have children; she did not have any offspring.
1:11:31/Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran's son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai (Abram's wife), and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
1:11:32/Terah lived two hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.
1:12:1/The LORD told Abram, "Leave your country, your relatives, and your father's house, and go to a land I will show you.
1:12:2/I will make you into a great nation, I will bless you, I will make your name famous, and you will be a blessing.
1:12:3/I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you; and through you, all families on earth will be blessed."
1:12:4/So Abram left, as the LORD had instructed him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.
1:12:5/Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all their possessions, and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, where they eventually arrived.
1:12:6/Abram traveled through the land to the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, the Canaanites were in the land.
1:12:7/The LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring, I will give this land." So there Abram built an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
1:12:8/He moved from there to a mountain east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. There he built another altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD.
1:12:9/Then Abram continued traveling, heading south.
1:12:10/But there was a severe famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there temporarily because the famine was severe.
1:12:11/As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know you are a beautiful woman,
1:12:12/and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live.
1:12:13/Please say you are my sister, so it will go well for me because of you, and my life will be spared thanks to you."
1:12:14/When Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians noticed that Sarai was very beautiful.
1:12:15/The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's palace.
1:12:16/Pharaoh treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
1:12:17/But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
1:12:18/So Pharaoh summoned Abram and asked, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?
1:12:19/Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"
1:12:20/Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him away, along with his wife and everything he had.
1:13:1/Abram left Egypt with his wife, all his possessions, and Lot, heading south.
1:13:2/Abram was extremely wealthy, with lots of livestock, silver, and gold.
1:13:3/He traveled from the south to Bethel, to the spot where his tent had been at first, between Bethel and Hai.
1:13:4/He returned to the altar he had built there and called on the LORD's name.
1:13:5/Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had sheep, cattle, and tents.
1:13:6/The land couldn't support them living together because their possessions were so vast.
1:13:7/There was conflict between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the land at that time.
1:13:8/Abram said to Lot, "Please let's not have any conflict between us or our herdsmen. We're family.
1:13:9/Look around you. The whole land is available. Please, let's separate. If you go left, I'll go right; if you go right, I'll go left."
1:13:10/Lot looked around and saw that the whole Jordan Valley was well-watered everywhere, like the LORD's garden or the land of Egypt, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
1:13:11/So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself and traveled east, and they separated from each other.
1:13:12/Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain, setting up his tent near Sodom.
1:13:13/But the people of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful against the LORD.
1:13:14/After Lot had gone, the LORD said to Abram, "Look around from where you are, to the north, south, east, and west.
1:13:15/All the land you see, I will give to you and your descendants forever.
1:13:16/And I will make your descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth; so that if someone could count the dust, then your descendants could be counted.
1:13:17/Get up and walk through the land, its length and breadth, for I am giving it to you."
1:13:18/Then Abram moved his tent and settled in the oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.
1:14:1/In the time of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
1:14:2/These kings waged war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, now known as Zoar.
1:14:3/All of them joined forces in the valley of Siddim, which is now the Dead Sea.
1:14:4/For twelve years they were under Chedorlaomer's rule, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
1:14:5/And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him came and defeated the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
1:14:6/And the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as Elparan, which is by the desert.
1:14:7/Then they turned back and went to Enmishpat, now Kadesh, and conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites living in Hazezontamar.
1:14:8/The king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also known as Zoar) went out and lined up for battle against them in the Valley of Siddim;
1:14:9/Against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
1:14:10/The Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, while the rest escaped to the hills.
1:14:11/The victors took all the possessions and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way.
1:14:12/They also captured Lot, Abram's nephew who lived in Sodom, along with his possessions, and left.
1:14:13/A survivor came and informed Abram the Hebrew, who was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allies of Abram.
1:14:14/When Abram learned that his relative had been taken captive, he called out his trained men, born in his household—318 of them—and chased the captors as far as Dan.
1:14:15/He and his servants attacked them at night, defeated them, and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
1:14:16/He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, along with the women and other people.
1:14:17/The king of Sodom went out to meet Abram after his victory over Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
1:14:18/Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the priest of God Most High.
1:14:19/He blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.
1:14:20/And praise be to God Most High, who has handed over your enemies to you." And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
1:14:21/The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself."
1:14:22/But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have sworn an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
1:14:23/That I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, 'I made Abram rich.'
1:14:24/I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them have their share."
1:15:1/After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram: I am your protector, and your very great reward."
1:15:2/And Abram said, "LORD God, what will you give me, since I am childless, and the manager of my household is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
1:15:3/And Abram said, "Look, you have given me no offspring: and, see, someone born in my house will inherit everything."
1:15:4/Then, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "This person will not be your heir; but someone who is your own biological child will be your heir."
1:15:5/He took him outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can: and he said to him, "Your descendants will be just as numerous."
1:15:6/And he trusted in the LORD; and it was credited to him as righteousness.
1:15:7/And He said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it."
1:15:8/And he said, "LORD God, how will I know that I will possess it?"
1:15:9/And He said to him, "Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
1:15:10/He brought all these to Him, cut them in half, and placed each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in half.
1:15:11/And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
1:15:12/As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.
1:15:13/And He said to Abram, "Be certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and will be enslaved and mistreated there for four hundred years.
1:15:14/But I will judge the nation they serve, and afterward, they will come out with great possessions.
1:15:15/And you will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.
1:15:16/But in the fourth generation, they will return here, for the wrongdoing of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."
1:15:17/When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.
1:15:18/On that day, the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates:
1:15:19/The Kenites, the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
1:15:20/And the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,
1:15:21/And the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
1:16:1/Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not been able to have children for him. She had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.
1:16:2/And Sarai said to Abram, "Look, the LORD has prevented me from having children. Please sleep with my servant; maybe I can have children through her." Abram listened to what Sarai said.
1:16:3/So after Abram had been living in Canaan for ten years, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.
1:16:4/Abram slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she realized she was pregnant, she began to look down on her mistress.
1:16:5/Then Sarai said to Abram, "This is your fault! I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she's pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me."
1:16:6/But Abram said to Sarai, "Look, your servant is in your hands; do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar, so she ran away.
1:16:7/The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the desert, by the spring on the way to Shur.
1:16:8/And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" She said, "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai."
1:16:9/The angel of the LORD told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her."
1:16:10/The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count."
1:16:11/And the angel of the LORD said to her, "You are pregnant and will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard of your misery.
1:16:12/He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers."
1:16:13/She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."
1:16:14/That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.
1:16:15/And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
1:16:16/Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
1:17:1/When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am the Almighty God; walk before me and be blameless.
1:17:2/I will establish my covenant between me and you, and will greatly increase your numbers."
1:17:3/Abram fell facedown, and God spoke to him, saying,
1:17:4/"As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
1:17:5/Your name will no longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
1:17:6/I will make you extremely fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will descend from you.
1:17:7/I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
1:17:8/And to you and your descendants after you, I will give the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
1:17:9/Then God said to Abraham, "You must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
1:17:10/This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
1:17:11/You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
1:17:12/For the generations to come, every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.
1:17:13/Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
1:17:14/Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
1:17:15/And God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
1:17:16/I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
1:17:17/Then Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"
1:17:18/And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"
1:17:19/Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
1:17:20/As for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
1:17:21/But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year."
1:17:22/After finishing speaking with him, God went up from Abraham.
1:17:23/Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God had told him.
1:17:24/Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
1:17:25/and his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised.
1:17:26/On that very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
1:17:27/And all the men of his household, whether born in the household or bought from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
1:18:1/The LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre as he sat at the entrance of his tent during the hottest part of the day.
1:18:2/He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent entrance to meet them and bowed down to the ground.
1:18:3/He said, "My Lord, if I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant.
1:18:4/Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
1:18:5/I'll get some bread so you can refresh yourselves before you go on, since you've come to your servant." And they said, "Do as you have said."
1:18:6/Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quickly prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes."
1:18:7/Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender and good calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
1:18:8/He then took curds, milk, and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. He stood by them under the tree while they ate.
1:18:9/They asked him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" He replied, "There, in the tent."
1:18:10/One of them said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son." Sarah heard this from the entrance of the tent, which was behind him.
1:18:11/Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
1:18:12/So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"
1:18:13/The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?'
1:18:14/Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time, I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."
1:18:15/But Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh," because she was afraid. He said, "No, but you did laugh."
1:18:16/The men set out from there and looked down toward Sodom, with Abraham walking with them to see them on their way.
1:18:17/Then the LORD said, "Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
1:18:18/considering that Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him?
1:18:19/For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."
1:18:20/Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their sin so grievous,
1:18:21/that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know."
1:18:22/The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
1:18:23/Abraham approached and said, "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
1:18:24/What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
1:18:25/Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
1:18:26/The LORD said, "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake."
1:18:27/Abraham spoke up again: "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
1:18:28/what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it."
1:18:29/Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."
1:18:30/Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."
1:18:31/Abraham said, "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it."
1:18:32/Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it."
1:18:33/The LORD went on his way as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
1:19:1/Two angels arrived in Sodom in the evening; Lot was sitting at the city gate. When Lot saw them, he got up to greet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
1:19:2/He said, "Please, my lords, come to my house to spend the night. You can wash your feet, then get up early and continue on your journey." But they answered, "No, we'll stay in the square."
1:19:3/However, Lot insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
1:19:4/But before they went to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom surrounded the house, both young and old.
1:19:5/They called out to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them."
1:19:6/Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him.
1:19:7/He said, "Please, my friends, don't do such a wicked thing.
1:19:8/Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."
1:19:9/They replied, "Stand back!" And they said, "This man came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept pressing in on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
1:19:10/But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
1:19:11/Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they couldn't find the door.
1:19:12/The men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else in the city? Get them out of here,
1:19:13/because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry against its people has become so great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
1:19:14/So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
1:19:15/With the dawn breaking, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."
1:19:16/When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them.
1:19:17/As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Run for your life! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Run to the mountains or you will be swept away!"
1:19:18/But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, please!
1:19:19/Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't run to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die.
1:19:20/Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it's small. Let me flee to it—it's very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared."
1:19:21/He said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.
1:19:22/Hurry, escape there, because I can't do anything until you reach it." That is why the town was called Zoar.
1:19:23/The sun had risen over the land when Lot entered Zoar.
1:19:24/Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens.
1:19:25/He overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.
1:19:26/But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
1:19:27/Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
1:19:28/He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
1:19:29/When God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
1:19:30/Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
1:19:31/The older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth.
1:19:32/Let's get our father to drink wine, and then we can sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father."
1:19:33/That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with her father. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
1:19:34/The next day, the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I slept with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father."
1:19:35/So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again, he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
1:19:36/In this way, both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.
1:19:37/The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today.
1:19:38/And the younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
1:20:1/And Abraham traveled from there toward the southern lands, and lived between Kadesh and Shur, and stayed temporarily in Gerar.
1:20:2/And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for and took Sarah.
1:20:3/But God came to Abimelech in a dream at night, and said, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is another man's wife."
1:20:4/But Abimelech had not been intimate with her, and he said, "Lord, would you destroy an innocent nation too?
1:20:5/Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' With a clear conscience and clean hands, I did this."
1:20:6/And God said to him in a dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and I have also prevented you from sinning against me. That's why I did not let you touch her.
1:20:7/Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will surely die, you and all who belong to you."
1:20:8/So Abimelech got up early in the morning, called all his servants, and told them all these things, and the men were terrified.
1:20:9/Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such a great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done."
1:20:10/And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see that made you do this?"
1:20:11/And Abraham said, "I thought, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
1:20:12/And indeed, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.
1:20:13/And when God made me wander from my father's house, I told her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'
1:20:14/And Abimelech took sheep, oxen, male servants, and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.
1:20:15/And Abimelech said, "Look, my land is before you; live wherever you like."
1:20:16/And to Sarah he said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
1:20:17/So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so they could have children again.
1:20:18/For the LORD had caused all the women in Abimelech's household to be infertile because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
1:21:1/The LORD visited Sarah as he had promised, and did for Sarah what he had said.
1:21:2/Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age, exactly at the time God had promised.
1:21:3/Abraham named his son, who was born to him and whom Sarah bore, Isaac.
1:21:4/Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, following God's command.
1:21:5/Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
1:21:6/Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."
1:21:7/She also said, "Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet, I have given birth to a son in his old age."
1:21:8/The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham threw a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
1:21:9/Sarah saw that the son Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking.
1:21:10/So she said to Abraham, "Get rid of this slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."
1:21:11/This matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
1:21:12/But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
1:21:13/I will make the son of the slave woman into a nation also, because he is your offspring."
1:21:14/Early the next morning, Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.
1:21:15/When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.
1:21:16/Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there, she began to sob.
1:21:17/God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What's the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
1:21:18/Get up, lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."
1:21:19/Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
1:21:20/God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.
1:21:21/He lived in the Desert of Paran, and his mother got him a wife from Egypt.
1:21:22/At that time, Abimelech and Phichol, the commander of his forces, said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do.
1:21:23/Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you."
1:21:24/Abraham said, "I swear it."
1:21:25/Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized.
1:21:26/Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I only heard about it today."
1:21:27/Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty.
1:21:28/Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock.
1:21:29/Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?"
1:21:30/Abraham replied, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well."
1:21:31/So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.
1:21:32/After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phichol, the commander of his forces, returned to the land of the Philistines.
1:21:33/Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.
1:21:34/And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
1:22:1/After these events, God tested Abraham. He called to him, "Abraham!" and Abraham responded, "Here I am."
1:22:2/God said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you."
1:22:3/Early the next morning, Abraham got up, saddled his donkey, took two of his servants and his son Isaac, cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out for the place God had told him about.
1:22:4/On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
1:22:5/Abraham told his servants, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there to worship and then we'll come back to you."
1:22:6/Abraham placed the wood for the burnt offering on Isaac's shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,
1:22:7/Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
1:22:8/Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them continued on together.
1:22:9/When they arrived at the place God had directed him to, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
1:22:10/Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son.
1:22:11/But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.
1:22:12/"Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."
1:22:13/Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
1:22:14/Abraham named that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."
1:22:15/And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time,
1:22:16/"Because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I swear by myself," declares the LORD,
1:22:17/"that I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,
1:22:18/and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."
1:22:19/Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.
1:22:20/Some time later, Abraham was told, "Milcah is also a mother; she has given birth to sons for your brother Nahor:
1:22:21/Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
1:22:22/Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1:22:23/Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
1:22:24/His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
1:23:1/Sarah lived to be one hundred and twenty-seven years old; these were the years of Sarah's life.
1:23:2/Sarah passed away in Kirjatharba, which is also known as Hebron in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to cry over her loss.
1:23:3/Abraham stood up from beside his deceased wife and spoke to the Hethites, saying,
1:23:4/"I am a foreigner and a temporary resident among you. Please allow me to buy a burial site from you so that I can bury my deceased wife out of my sight."
1:23:5/The Hethites responded to Abraham, telling him,
1:23:6/"Listen to us, sir. You are a respected prince among us. Choose the best of our tombs to bury your dead. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead."
1:23:7/Abraham got up and bowed to the local people, the Hethites.
1:23:8/He negotiated with them, saying, "If you agree that I should bury my dead away from my sight, please plead with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf,
1:23:9/So that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns at the edge of his field. Let him sell it to me at its full price for a burial site among you."
1:23:10/Ephron was sitting among the Hethites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hethites, everyone who entered the city gate, saying,
1:23:11/"No, my lord, listen to me. I give you the field, and the cave that is in it, I give it to you. In the presence of my people, I give it to you. Bury your dead."
1:23:12/Abraham bowed down before the local people.
1:23:13/He said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "But if you will, please listen to me. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so that I may bury my dead there."
1:23:14/Ephron responded to Abraham, saying to him,
1:23:15/"My lord, listen to me. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between friends? Go ahead and bury your dead."
1:23:16/Abraham agreed with Ephron and paid Ephron the silver he had mentioned in the hearing of the Hethites: four hundred shekels of silver, accepted as currency by merchants.
1:23:17/The field of Ephron in Machpelah, near Mamre—the field, the cave in it, and all the trees within the boundaries of the field—was legally transferred
1:23:18/To Abraham as his property in the presence of the Hethites, before all who entered the city gate.
1:23:19/Afterward, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah near Mamre, which is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.
1:23:20/The field and the cave in it were legally secured to Abraham by the Hethites as a burial site.
1:24:1/Abraham was old and advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way.
1:24:2/Abraham said to his senior servant, who managed all he owned, "Please place your hand under my thigh:
1:24:3/And swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live:
1:24:4/Instead, you must go to my homeland and my relatives to find a wife for my son Isaac."
1:24:5/The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Should I then take your son back to the country you came from?"
1:24:6/Abraham replied, "Make sure you do not take my son back there.
1:24:7/The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s household and my native land, who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'—He will send His angel ahead of you, and you will get a wife for my son from there.
1:24:8/If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Just do not take my son back there."
1:24:9/So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
1:24:10/The servant took ten of his master’s camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.
1:24:11/He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time women go out to draw water.
1:24:12/He prayed, "LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show kindness to my master Abraham.
1:24:13/Here I am, standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
1:24:14/May it be that when I say to a young woman, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I’ll water your camels too'—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
1:24:15/Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
1:24:16/The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.
1:24:17/The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar."
1:24:18/"Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
1:24:19/After she had given him a drink, she said, "I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink."
1:24:20/So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.
1:24:21/Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.
1:24:22/When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.
1:24:23/Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?"
1:24:24/She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor."
1:24:25/And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night."
1:24:26/Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,
1:24:27/saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives."
1:24:28/The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
1:24:29/Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.
1:24:30/As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
1:24:31/"Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
1:24:32/So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were provided for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
1:24:33/A meal was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." "Then tell us," they said.
1:24:34/He said, "I am Abraham’s servant.
1:24:35/The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
1:24:36/My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.
1:24:37/My master made me swear an oath and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
1:24:38/but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.'
1:24:39/Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?'
1:24:40/He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family.
1:24:41/You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.'
1:24:42/"When I came to the spring today, I said, 'LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.
1:24:43/See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, 'Please let me drink a little water from your jar,'
1:24:44/and she says to me, 'Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,' let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master’s son.'
1:24:45/"Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'
1:24:46/She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
1:24:47/I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.' Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
1:24:48/And I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to get the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.
1:24:49/Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn."
1:24:50/Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.
1:24:51/Here is Rebekah, right before you; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has directed."
1:24:52/When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.
1:24:53/Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
1:24:54/Afterward, they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master."
1:24:55/But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you may go."
1:24:56/But he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey successful; send me on my way so I may go to my master."
1:24:57/Then they said, "Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it."
1:24:58/So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" "I will go," she said.
1:24:59/So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.
1:24:60/And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies."
1:24:61/Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
1:24:62/Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.
1:24:63/He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.
1:24:64/Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
1:24:65/and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
1:24:66/Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
1:24:67/Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, married Rebekah, and loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
1:25:1/Then again Abraham married another woman, named Keturah.
1:25:2/And she gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah for him.
1:25:3/Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And Dedan's sons were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
1:25:4/Midian's sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were Keturah's children.
1:25:5/Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
1:25:6/But to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from his son Isaac, while he was still alive, to the eastern lands.
1:25:7/Abraham lived for 175 years.
1:25:8/Then Abraham passed away, dying at a ripe old age, satisfied with life; and he joined his ancestors in death.
1:25:9/Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre; 
1:25:10/This is the field Abraham bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with Sarah, his wife.
1:25:11/After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near the well Lahairoi.
1:25:12/Here are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham:
1:25:13/These are the names of Ishmael's sons, listed in the order of their birth: Nebajoth, the firstborn, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
1:25:14/Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
1:25:15/Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
1:25:16/These are Ishmael's sons, and these are their names, by their settlements and encampments: twelve tribal leaders according to their groups.
1:25:17/Ishmael lived 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
1:25:18/They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria. He died in the presence of all his relatives.
1:25:19/These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac.
1:25:20/Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
1:25:21/Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The LORD answered his prayer, and Rebekah his wife became pregnant.
1:25:22/The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
1:25:23/And the LORD told her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."
1:25:24/When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
1:25:25/The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.
1:25:26/Afterward, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
1:25:27/As the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.
1:25:28/Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
1:25:29/One day when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.
1:25:30/He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm exhausted!" That is why he was also called Edom.
1:25:31/Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright."
1:25:32/Esau said, "Look, I'm about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"
1:25:33/But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.
1:25:34/Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
1:26:1/There was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that occurred during Abraham's time. Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar.
1:26:2/The LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land I will tell you about:
1:26:3/Stay in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. I will give all these countries to you and your descendants, fulfilling the promise I made to your father Abraham.
1:26:4/I will increase your descendants to be as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give these lands to your descendants. Through your offspring, all nations on earth will be blessed.
1:26:5/Because Abraham listened to me and followed my requirements, my commands, my decrees, and my laws."
1:26:6/Isaac settled in Gerar.
1:26:7/When the local men asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife," thinking, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is very beautiful."
1:26:8/After he had been there a long time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out of a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah, his wife.
1:26:9/Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is obviously your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her."
1:26:10/Abimelech said, "What have you done to us? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
1:26:11/Abimelech warned all his people, saying, "Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
1:26:12/Then Isaac planted crops in that land and reaped a hundredfold that same year. The LORD blessed him.
1:26:13/The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.
1:26:14/He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
1:26:15/All the wells that his father's servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.
1:26:16/Abimelech told Isaac, "Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us."
1:26:17/So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.
1:26:18/Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.
1:26:19/Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.
1:26:20/But the herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him.
1:26:21/Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.
1:26:22/He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land."
1:26:23/From there he went up to Beersheba.
1:26:24/That night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham."
1:26:25/He built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there Isaac's servants dug a well.
1:26:26/Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath, his adviser, and Phichol, the commander of his forces.
1:26:27/Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?"
1:26:28/They answered, "We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, 'There ought to be a sworn agreement between us'—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you
1:26:29/that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. You are now the blessed of the LORD.'"
1:26:30/He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
1:26:31/Early the next morning, they swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.
1:26:32/That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, "We've found water!"
1:26:33/He named it Shibah, and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba.
1:26:34/When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
1:26:35/They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
1:27:1/When Isaac was old and his eyesight had faded so he couldn't see, he called Esau, his eldest son, and said, "My son." And he answered, "Here I am."
1:27:2/He said, "Look, I am old and don't know when I will die.
1:27:3/So please, take your weapons, your quiver and bow, and go out to the field to hunt some venison for me.
1:27:4/Then prepare a delicious meal, just the way I like it, and bring it to me to eat, so that I can give you my blessing before I pass away."
1:27:5/Rebekah overheard Isaac speaking to Esau. So Esau went out to the field to hunt for venison to bring back.
1:27:6/Rebekah then said to Jacob, her son, "Listen, I heard your father talking to your brother Esau, saying,
1:27:7/'Bring me some venison and prepare a delicious meal for me to eat, so I can bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.'
1:27:8/Now, my son, listen carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
1:27:9/Go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare them into a delicious meal for your father, just the way he likes it.
1:27:10/Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
1:27:11/Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, "But Esau is hairy, and I'm smooth-skinned.
1:27:12/If my father touches me, he'll know I'm deceiving him and I'll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing."
1:27:13/His mother said to him, "Let the curse fall on me, my son. Just do as I say and go get them for me."
1:27:14/So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared a delicious meal, just how his father liked it.
1:27:15/Rebekah took the best clothes of her elder son Esau, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.
1:27:16/She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goat skins.
1:27:17/Then she handed to her son Jacob the delicious meal and bread she had made.
1:27:18/He went to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
1:27:19/Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn. I've done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so you can bless me."
1:27:20/Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the LORD your God granted me success."
1:27:21/Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come closer so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not."
1:27:22/Jacob went close to Isaac his father, who touched him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
1:27:23/He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him.
1:27:24/He asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" And he replied, "I am."
1:27:25/Then he said, "Serve me, and let me eat some of my son's game, so that I may give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him and he ate; he also brought him wine, and he drank.
1:27:26/Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here and kiss me, my son."
1:27:27/So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac smelled the clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.
1:27:28/May God give you heaven's dew and earth's richness—an abundance of grain and new wine.
1:27:29/May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!"
1:27:30/As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.
1:27:31/He too prepared some delicious food and brought it to his father. He said to his father, "Let my father get up and eat some of his son's game, so that you may bless me."
1:27:32/His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
1:27:33/Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!"
1:27:34/When Esau heard his father's words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me—me too, my father!"
1:27:35/But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."
1:27:36/Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: he took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?"
1:27:37/Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him your lord and have given all his relatives to him as servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?"
1:27:38/Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud.
1:27:39/His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above.
1:27:40/You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck."
1:27:41/Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
1:27:42/When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.
1:27:43/Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
1:27:44/Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides.
1:27:45/When your brother's anger against you fades and he forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
1:27:46/And Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm sick of living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living."
1:28:1/Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and instructed him, saying, "You must not marry any of the Canaanite women.
1:28:2/Get up, go to Padanaram, to your mother's father Bethuel's house; and choose a wife for yourself from there, from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.
1:28:3/May God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful, and increase your numbers so that you become a community of peoples.
1:28:4/And may He grant you the blessing of Abraham, to you and your descendants with you, so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as a foreigner, which God gave to Abraham.
1:28:5/So Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Padanaram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
1:28:6/When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Padanaram to find a wife, and that as he blessed him he commanded him, saying, "You must not marry a Canaanite woman,"
1:28:7/And that Jacob had listened to his father and mother and had gone to Padanaram,
1:28:8/And Esau realized that his father Isaac did not approve of the Canaanite women,
1:28:9/Esau then went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael and sister of Nebajoth, in addition to the wives he already had.
1:28:10/Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran.
1:28:11/He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he used it as his pillow and lay down to sleep.
1:28:12/He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
1:28:13/And there above it stood the LORD, who said, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.
1:28:14/Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
1:28:15/I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
1:28:16/When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it."
1:28:17/He was filled with awe and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven."
1:28:18/Early in the morning, Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it.
1:28:19/He named that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz.
1:28:20/Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear
1:28:21/So that I return safely to my father's household, then the LORD will be my God.
1:28:22/And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth."
1:29:1/Then Jacob continued his journey and arrived in the land of the eastern peoples.
1:29:2/He saw a well in the field with three flocks of sheep resting near it; this well was used to water the flocks, and it was covered by a large stone.
1:29:3/All the flocks would gather there, and the shepherds would roll the stone away to water the sheep, then put the stone back over the well.
1:29:4/Jacob asked them, "My friends, where are you from?" They replied, "We're from Haran."
1:29:5/Then he asked, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's son?" They answered, "Yes, we know him."
1:29:6/He inquired, "Is he doing well?" They said, "He's fine, and look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."
1:29:7/He said, "Look, it's still broad daylight, not time to gather the animals. Water the sheep and take them to graze."
1:29:8/But they replied, "We can't until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the well; then we water the sheep."
1:29:9/While he was still talking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
1:29:10/When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, he went over, rolled the stone away from the well, and watered his uncle's sheep.
1:29:11/Jacob kissed Rachel, then broke down and cried.
1:29:12/He told Rachel he was her father's relative, Rebekah's son, and she ran to tell her father.
1:29:13/When Laban heard about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his home. Jacob told Laban all that had happened.
1:29:14/Laban said to him, "You are truly my own flesh and blood." And Jacob stayed with him for a month.
1:29:15/Then Laban said to Jacob, "Just because you're my relative doesn't mean you should work for me for nothing. Tell me, what should your wages be?"
1:29:16/Laban had two daughters: the older was Leah, and the younger was Rachel.
1:29:17/Leah had soft eyes, but Rachel was stunning and beautiful.
1:29:18/Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, "I'll work for you for seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel."
1:29:19/Laban replied, "It's better I give her to you than to someone else. Stay with me."
1:29:20/So Jacob worked seven years to get Rachel, but they felt like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
1:29:21/Then Jacob said to Laban, "My time is up; give me my wife so I can be with her."
1:29:22/Laban gathered all the men of the place and held a feast.
1:29:23/But in the evening, he took Leah, his daughter, to Jacob, and Jacob slept with her.
1:29:24/Laban gave his daughter Leah a servant, Zilpah, as a maid.
1:29:25/When morning came, there was Leah! Jacob said to Laban, "What have you done to me? I worked for Rachel. Why have you deceived me?"
1:29:26/Laban replied, "It's not our custom here to marry off the younger before the older.
1:29:27/Complete this bridal week with Leah, and we will also give you Rachel in return for another seven years of work."
1:29:28/Jacob agreed and completed the week with Leah. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.
1:29:29/Laban gave his daughter Rachel a servant, Bilhah, as her maid.
1:29:30/Jacob also slept with Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. He worked for Laban for another seven years.
1:29:31/When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.
1:29:32/Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, "The LORD has seen my misery; surely now my husband will love me."
1:29:33/She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, "Because the LORD heard that I am unloved, he has given me this son also." So she named him Simeon.
1:29:34/Again she conceived and gave birth to a son and said, "Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons." Therefore he was named Levi.
1:29:35/Once more she conceived and gave birth to a son. She said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
1:30:1/When Rachel saw that she couldn't have children for Jacob, she became jealous of her sister and told Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll die."
1:30:2/Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, "Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?"
1:30:3/She then said, "Here's my servant Bilhah; sleep with her so she can have children on my behalf and I too can have a family through her."
1:30:4/So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob slept with her.
1:30:5/Bilhah became pregnant and gave Jacob a son.
1:30:6/Rachel said, "God has vindicated me; He has listened to my plea and given me a son." Therefore, she named him Dan.
1:30:7/Then Bilhah, Rachel's servant, became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son.
1:30:8/Rachel said, "I have struggled greatly with my sister, and I have won." So she named him Naphtali.
1:30:9/When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
1:30:10/And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave Jacob a son.
1:30:11/Leah said, "A troop is coming!" So she named him Gad.
1:30:12/Then Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave Jacob a second son.
1:30:13/Leah said, "How happy I am! The women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
1:30:14/Reuben went out during the wheat harvest and found some mandrakes in the field, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
1:30:15/But she said to her, "Isn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son's mandrakes too?" Rachel said, "He can sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."
1:30:16/When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must sleep with me tonight because I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he slept with her that night.
1:30:17/God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.
1:30:18/Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband." So she named him Issachar.
1:30:19/And Leah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a sixth son.
1:30:20/Leah said, "God has presented me with a precious gift. Now my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
1:30:21/Later, she had a daughter and named her Dinah.
1:30:22/Then God remembered Rachel; He listened to her and enabled her to conceive.
1:30:23/She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, "God has taken away my disgrace."
1:30:24/She named him Joseph, saying, "May the Lord add another son to me."
1:30:25/After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.
1:30:26/Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and let me go. You know how much work I’ve done for you."
1:30:27/But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you."
1:30:28/He added, "Name your wages, and I will pay them."
1:30:29/Jacob said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.
1:30:30/The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when may I do something for my own household?"
1:30:31/"What shall I give you?" Laban asked. Jacob replied, "Don’t give me anything. But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:
1:30:32/Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and the spotted or speckled goats. They will be my wages.
1:30:33/And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen."
1:30:34/Laban said, "Agreed. Let it be as you have said."
1:30:35/That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them), and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.
1:30:36/Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.
1:30:37/Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
1:30:38/Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,
1:30:39/they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
1:30:40/Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark-colored animals in Laban’s herd. He put his own herds by themselves and did not put them with Laban’s animals.
1:30:41/Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,
1:30:42/but if the animals were weak, he would not put them there. So the weaker animals went to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob.
1:30:43/As a result, the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
1:31:1/He overheard Laban's sons saying, "Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father; he's gained all this wealth from what was once our father's."
1:31:2/And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude towards him had changed; it was not as friendly as before.
1:31:3/Then the LORD told Jacob, "Go back to the land of your ancestors and to your family, and I will be with you."
1:31:4/Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.
1:31:5/He told them, "I've noticed that your father doesn't look at me the same way he used to; however, the God of my father has been with me.
1:31:6/You both know how hard I've worked for your father.
1:31:7/Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; but God didn't allow him to harm me.
1:31:8/If he said, 'Your wages will be the speckled animals,' then all the animals gave birth to speckled young. And if he said, 'Your wages will be the striped animals,' then all the animals gave birth to striped young.
1:31:9/In this way, God has taken your father's livestock and given them to me.
1:31:10/It happened that during the breeding season, I had a dream where I saw that the male goats mating with the females were striped, speckled, and mottled.
1:31:11/And in the dream, God's angel called out to me, 'Jacob!' and I answered, 'Here I am.'
1:31:12/He said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are striped, speckled, and mottled, for I have seen everything Laban has been doing to you.
1:31:13/I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now, get up, leave this land, and return to your homeland.'
1:31:14/Rachel and Leah responded, "Do we still have any share in our father's inheritance?
1:31:15/Aren't we considered foreigners by him? He sold us and has used up all the money that should have been ours.
1:31:16/All the wealth that God has taken from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you."
1:31:17/Then Jacob got ready, put his children and wives on camels,
1:31:18/and took all his livestock and all the possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
1:31:19/While Laban was away shearing his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods.
1:31:20/Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was fleeing.
1:31:21/So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
1:31:22/Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
1:31:23/So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
1:31:24/But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
1:31:25/When Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hills, and Laban and his relatives camped in the hill country of Gilead.
1:31:26/Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me and carried off my daughters like captives in war.
1:31:27/Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you off with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?
1:31:28/You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.
1:31:29/I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father warned me, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
1:31:30/Now you have gone because you longed to return to your father's household. But why did you steal my gods?"
1:31:31/Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
1:31:32/But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
1:31:33/So Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.
1:31:34/Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
1:31:35/Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.
1:31:36/Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. Jacob said to him, "What is my crime? What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?
1:31:37/Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between us.
1:31:38/I've been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
1:31:39/I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
1:31:40/This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
1:31:41/It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.
1:31:42/If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."
1:31:43/Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. Everything you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?
1:31:44/Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."
1:31:45/So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
1:31:46/Then Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
1:31:47/Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
1:31:48/Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed,
1:31:49/And also Mizpah, because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
1:31:50/If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."
1:31:51/Then Laban said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
1:31:52/This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
1:31:53/May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
1:31:54/Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.
1:31:55/Early the next morning, Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and returned home.
1:32:1/And Jacob continued on his journey, and he encountered angels of God.
1:32:2/When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's army," and he named that place Mahanaim.
1:32:3/Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the region of Edom.
1:32:4/He instructed them, "This is what you should say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now:
1:32:5/I have acquired cattle, donkeys, sheep, male servants, and female servants, and I am sending this message to my lord in hopes of gaining your favor.'"
1:32:6/The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We went to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, with four hundred men accompanying him."
1:32:7/Then Jacob was very afraid and distressed, so he divided the people with him, as well as the flocks, herds, and camels, into two groups;
1:32:8/Thinking, "If Esau attacks one group, the other group that is left may escape."
1:32:9/And Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, LORD, who told me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make things go well for you':
1:32:10/I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant; I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two groups.
1:32:11/Please save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid he might come and attack me, and the mothers with their children.
1:32:12/And you have said, 'I will surely treat you well and make your descendants as numerous as the sand of the sea, which is too great to count.'"
1:32:13/He spent that night there and selected a gift for his brother Esau from what he had:
1:32:14/Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
1:32:15/Thirty nursing camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
1:32:16/He handed them over to his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me and keep some space between the herds."
1:32:17/He instructed the one in the lead, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Who do you belong to? Where are you going? And who owns all these animals in front of you?'
1:32:18/Then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"
1:32:19/He also gave the same instructions to the second, the third, and all the others who followed the herds, "This is what you are to say to Esau when you meet him.
1:32:20/And be sure to say, 'Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.'" Jacob thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts going ahead of me, and later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me."
1:32:21/So the gifts went on ahead of him, while he himself spent that night in the camp.
1:32:22/That night he got up and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
1:32:23/After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
1:32:24/So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
1:32:25/When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
1:32:26/Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
1:32:27/The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.
1:32:28/Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."
1:32:29/Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" And there he blessed Jacob.
1:32:30/So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."
1:32:31/As he crossed over Penuel, the sun rose on him and he was limping because of his hip.
1:32:32/That is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the man touched the socket of Jacob's hip in the tendon that shrank.
1:33:1/Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with four hundred men. He then divided his children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
1:33:2/He placed the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and finally Rachel and Joseph at the back.
1:33:3/He went ahead of them, bowing to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
1:33:4/Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, put his arms around his neck, and kissed him. They both cried.
1:33:5/When he saw the women and children, he asked, "Who are these with you?" Jacob answered, "These are the children God has graciously given to me, your servant."
1:33:6/Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.
1:33:7/Next, Leah and her children came forward and bowed down, and after them, Joseph and Rachel also bowed down.
1:33:8/Esau asked, "What's the meaning of all the herds I met?" Jacob replied, "To gain favor in your eyes, my lord."
1:33:9/Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."
1:33:10/But Jacob said, "Please, if I have found favor with you, accept my gift. Seeing your face is like seeing the face of God, especially since you have accepted me."
1:33:11/"Please accept my gift that has been brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.
1:33:12/Esau suggested, "Let's get going and I'll lead the way."
1:33:13/But Jacob said, "My lord knows that the children are delicate, and I have to care for the nursing flocks and herds. If they are driven hard for even one day, all the animals could die.
1:33:14/Please go ahead of your servant. I'll move at a slow pace, in step with the livestock and the children, until I reach my lord in Seir."
1:33:15/Esau offered, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." But Jacob asked, "Why do that? Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."
1:33:16/So Esau set off that day back to Seir.
1:33:17/Jacob traveled to Succoth, built a house, and made shelters for his livestock. That's why the place is called Succoth.
1:33:18/Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan, coming from Paddan Aram, and camped in front of the city.
1:33:19/He bought a piece of land where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of silver.
1:33:20/He set up an altar there and named it El-Elohe-Israel.
1:34:1/Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to see the local women.
1:34:2/When Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite and prince of the region, saw her, he took her, forced himself on her, and violated her.
1:34:3/He became deeply attached to Dinah, Jacob's daughter, fell in love with her, and spoke tenderly to her.
1:34:4/Shechem asked his father Hamor, "Please get me this girl as my wife."
1:34:5/Jacob found out that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah. His sons were out in the fields with his livestock, so he didn't say anything until they returned.
1:34:6/Hamor, Shechem's father, went to talk to Jacob about the matter.
1:34:7/When Jacob's sons heard about it, they came in from the fields. They were deeply upset and furious because Shechem had done something outrageous in Israel by sleeping with Jacob's daughter—a thing that should never be done.
1:34:8/Hamor tried to negotiate with them, saying, "My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please let him marry her."
1:34:9/"Let's make marriages between us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves.
1:34:10/You can live among us; the land is open to you. Live here, trade, and acquire property in it."
1:34:11/Shechem also said to her father and brothers, "Let me win your favor, and I'll give you whatever you ask.
1:34:12/Demand any bride-price or gift, and I'll pay it. Just let me marry the girl."
1:34:13/Jacob's sons responded deceitfully to Shechem and his father Hamor because of what he had done to their sister Dinah.
1:34:14/They said, "We can't do this; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.
1:34:15/But we will agree to it on one condition: if every male among you gets circumcised as we are.
1:34:16/Then we'll give you our daughters, take your daughters for ourselves, live among you, and become one community.
1:34:17/But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we'll take our sister and leave."
1:34:18/Hamor and his son Shechem were pleased with this proposal.
1:34:19/Shechem didn't hesitate to do what was asked because he was smitten with Jacob's daughter. He was more respected than anyone else in his father's household.
1:34:20/Hamor and Shechem went to their city's gate and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
1:34:21/"These men are friendly toward us. Let them live in the land and trade in it. The land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and give them ours.
1:34:22/But there's one condition for them to agree to live with us and become one community: every male among us must be circumcised as they are.
1:34:23/Then won't their livestock, property, and all their animals become ours? Just agree to their condition, and they will settle among us."
1:34:24/Everyone who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
1:34:25/On the third day, when they were in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords, boldly attacked the city, and killed all the males.
1:34:26/They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, took Dinah from Shechem's house, and left.
1:34:27/Jacob's sons came upon the dead and looted the city because their sister had been defiled.
1:34:28/They seized their flocks, herds, donkeys, everything in the city, and in the fields,
1:34:29/took all their wealth, their children, and their wives, and plundered everything in the houses.
1:34:30/Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You've brought trouble on me, making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. Since I have few men, they'll band together against me, attack me, and I and my household will be destroyed."
1:34:31/But they said, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"
1:35:1/And God told Jacob, "Get up, go to Bethel, and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were running away from your brother Esau."
1:35:2/Then Jacob told his family and everyone with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have, purify yourselves, and change your clothes.
1:35:3/Let's get up and go to Bethel. There, I will build an altar to God, who listened to me in my time of trouble and has been with me wherever I have gone."
1:35:4/So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings they were wearing. Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem.
1:35:5/As they traveled, a great fear from God fell upon the surrounding cities, so they did not chase after Jacob's group.
1:35:6/So Jacob arrived at Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, also known as Bethel, along with all the people with him.
1:35:7/There he built an altar and named the place Elbethel, because God had appeared to him there when he was fleeing from his brother.
1:35:8/But Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel, so it was named Allonbachuth.
1:35:9/And God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan-aram and blessed him.
1:35:10/And God told him, "Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel." So he named him Israel.
1:35:11/And God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and increase in number; a nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants.
1:35:12/And the land I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you."
1:35:13/Then God left him at the place where he had spoken with him.
1:35:14/And Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it, and also poured oil on it.
1:35:15/And Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
1:35:16/They left Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had a difficult labor.
1:35:17/When she was in severe labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid; you're going to have another son."
1:35:18/As she was dying, she named her son Ben-Oni, but his father named him Benjamin.
1:35:19/And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
1:35:20/And Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
1:35:21/Then Israel moved on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
1:35:22/While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons:
1:35:23/The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
1:35:24/The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
1:35:25/And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s servant: Dan and Naphtali.
1:35:26/And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s servant: Gad and Asher. These were Jacob's sons, born to him in Paddan-aram.
1:35:27/And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
1:35:28/Isaac lived 180 years.
1:35:29/Then Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
1:36:1/Here are the descendants of Esau, also known as Edom.
1:36:2/Esau married women from Canaan: Adah, daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
1:36:3/And Bashemath, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebajoth.
1:36:4/Adah gave birth to Eliphaz for Esau; Bashemath gave birth to Reuel;
1:36:5/And Aholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are Esau's sons, born to him in Canaan.
1:36:6/Esau took his wives, sons, daughters, all household members, his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a region away from his brother Jacob.
1:36:7/Their wealth was so great that they couldn't live together; the land where they were staying couldn't support them because of their livestock.
1:36:8/So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom.
1:36:9/These are the descendants of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir:
1:36:10/These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel, son of Esau's wife Bashemath.
1:36:11/The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
1:36:12/Timna, a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Esau's wife Adah.
1:36:13/These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Bashemath.
1:36:14/These were the sons of Aholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife. She bore to Esau Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
1:36:15/These were the chiefs among Esau's sons: the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's firstborn, chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
1:36:16/Chief Korah, chief Gatam, and chief Amalek. These are the chiefs from Eliphaz in Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
1:36:17/And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son; chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs from Reuel in Edom; these are the sons of Esau's wife Bashemath.
1:36:18/And these are the sons of Aholibamah, Esau's wife; chief Jeush, chief Jaalam, chief Korah. These were the chiefs from Aholibamah, daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
1:36:19/These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom), and these are their chiefs.
1:36:20/These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who lived in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah,
1:36:21/And Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the descendants of Seir in Edom.
1:36:22/And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; Lotan's sister was Timna.
1:36:23/And the children of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
1:36:24/And these are the children of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness while pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
1:36:25/And the children of Anah were Dishon and Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
1:36:26/And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
1:36:27/The children of Ezer are these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
1:36:28/The children of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran.
1:36:29/These are the chiefs who came from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
1:36:30/Chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs who came from Hori, among their chiefs in the land of Seir.
1:36:31/These are the kings who ruled in Edom before any Israelite king reigned.
1:36:32/Bela, son of Beor, ruled in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
1:36:33/When Bela died, Jobab, son of Zerah from Bozrah, succeeded him.
1:36:34/After Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites ruled in his place.
1:36:35/When Husham died, Hadad, son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, ruled in his place. His city was named Avith.
1:36:36/After Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah ruled in his place.
1:36:37/When Samlah died, Saul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him.
1:36:38/After Saul died, Baal-hanan, son of Achbor, ruled in his place.
1:36:39/When Baal-hanan, son of Achbor, died, Hadar ruled in his place. His city was named Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.
1:36:40/These are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, by their families, locations, and by their names: chief Timnah, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
1:36:41/Chief Aholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
1:36:42/Chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
1:36:43/Chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they owned. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
1:37:1/Jacob lived in the land where his father had been a foreigner, in the land of Canaan.
1:37:2/These are the descendants of Jacob. Joseph, at seventeen years old, was tending the flock with his brothers; and the young man was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph reported their bad behavior to their father.
1:37:3/Israel loved Joseph more than all his other children because he was born in his old age, and he made him a colorful coat.
1:37:4/When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and couldn't speak to him kindly.
1:37:5/Joseph had a dream and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more.
1:37:6/He said to them, "Please listen to this dream I had:
1:37:7/We were tying up bundles of grain in the field when suddenly my bundle stood up and your bundles gathered around mine and bowed down to it."
1:37:8/His brothers asked him, "Do you really think you will reign over us or have authority over us?" And they disliked him even more because of his dreams and what he said.
1:37:9/Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, "Look, I had another dream, and this time the sun, moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
1:37:10/When he told his father and brothers, his father scolded him and said, "What kind of dream is this? Will your mother, your brothers, and I actually come to bow down to the ground before you?"
1:37:11/His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
1:37:12/His brothers went to graze their father's flock near Shechem.
1:37:13/Israel said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers grazing the flock in Shechem? Come, I'll send you to them." And he replied, "Here I am."
1:37:14/He told him, "Go and see if everything is alright with your brothers and the flock, and bring me back a report." So he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron, and Joseph went to Shechem.
1:37:15/A man found him wandering in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"
1:37:16/He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are grazing their flocks."
1:37:17/The man said, "They have moved on from here; I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.
1:37:18/But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
1:37:19/They said to each other, "Here comes that dreamer.
1:37:20/Let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns. We can say a vicious animal ate him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."
1:37:21/When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.
1:37:22/Reuben said to them, "Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him." He said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
1:37:23/So when Joseph arrived, his brothers stripped him of his colorful coat, the one he was wearing.
1:37:24/Then they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
1:37:25/As they sat down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to take them down to Egypt.
1:37:26/Judah said to his brothers, "What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
1:37:27/Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh." His brothers agreed.
1:37:28/Then some Midianite traders passed by. They pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.
1:37:29/When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
1:37:30/He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone! What am I going to do?"
1:37:31/Then they took Joseph's coat, slaughtered a goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
1:37:32/They took the colorful coat back to their father and said, "We found this. Please examine it to see if it is your son's coat or not."
1:37:33/He recognized it and said, "It is my son's coat. A wild animal must have eaten him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."
1:37:34/Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son for many days.
1:37:35/All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave." So his father wept for him.
1:37:36/And the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.
1:38:1/At that time, Judah left his brothers and stayed with a man from Adullam named Hirah.
1:38:2/There, Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shuah. He married her and slept with her.
1:38:3/She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, whom she named Er.
1:38:4/She got pregnant again and gave birth to another son, naming him Onan.
1:38:5/Once more, she became pregnant and had a son, whom she named Shelah. She was in Chezib when she gave birth to him.
1:38:6/Judah arranged for Er, his firstborn, to marry a woman named Tamar.
1:38:7/But Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the Lord's sight, so the Lord took his life.
1:38:8/Then Judah told Onan, "Marry your brother's widow. Fulfill your duty as a brother-in-law and provide offspring for your brother."
1:38:9/But Onan knew that the child would not be considered his. So whenever he slept with his brother's wife, he wasted his semen on the ground to avoid providing offspring for his brother.
1:38:10/What he did was displeasing in the Lord's sight, so He also took Onan's life.
1:38:11/Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." He thought, "He might die too, just like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
1:38:12/After some time, Judah's wife, the daughter of Shuah, died. After Judah had mourned, he went up to Timnath to his sheep shearers, along with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
1:38:13/When Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnath to shear his sheep,"
1:38:14/she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnath. She saw that Shelah had grown up, but she had not been given to him as his wife.
1:38:15/When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face.
1:38:16/He turned to her by the roadside and said, "Come, let me sleep with you." He did not realize she was his daughter-in-law. She asked, "What will you give me to sleep with you?"
1:38:17/He replied, "I'll send you a young goat from my flock." She asked, "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?"
1:38:18/He asked, "What pledge should I give you?" She replied, "Your seal, its cord, and the staff in your hand." So he gave them to her, slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
1:38:19/She got up, left, removed her veil, and put on her widow's clothes again.
1:38:20/Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.
1:38:21/He asked the men of the area, "Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?" They said, "There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here."
1:38:22/He went back to Judah and said, "I didn't find her. Also, the men of the area said there hasn't been any shrine prostitute here."
1:38:23/Judah said, "Let her keep the items, or we'll become a laughingstock. After all, I did send this young goat, but you didn't find her."
1:38:24/About three months later, Judah was told, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has been acting like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant because of it." Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death."
1:38:25/As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law, "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," and she added, "Please see whose seal and cord and staff these are."
1:38:26/Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I didn't give her to my son Shelah." And he did not sleep with her again.
1:38:27/When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb.
1:38:28/During her labor, one of them put out his hand, and the midwife tied a scarlet thread around it, saying, "This one came out first."
1:38:29/But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, "So this is how you have broken out!" And he was named Perez.
1:38:30/Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his hand, came out, and he was named Zerah.
1:39:1/Joseph was taken to Egypt; Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.
1:39:2/The LORD was with Joseph, making him a successful man; he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
1:39:3/His master noticed that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made everything he did successful.
1:39:4/Joseph gained his favor and served him; he appointed him overseer of his house, entrusting him with everything he owned.
1:39:5/From the time he appointed him overseer in his house and over all he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house because of Joseph; the LORD's blessing was on everything he had, both in the house and in the field.
1:39:6/He left everything he had in Joseph's care; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Joseph was handsome and well-built.
1:39:7/After these events, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Sleep with me."
1:39:8/But he refused and told his master's wife, "Look, my master doesn't worry about anything in the house with me here, and he has entrusted everything he owns to my care.
1:39:9/No one is greater in this house than I am; my master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?"
1:39:10/Even though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
1:39:11/One day, when Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants were inside,
1:39:12/she caught him by his cloak and said, "Sleep with me." But he left his cloak in her hand, ran out of the house, and escaped.
1:39:13/When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
1:39:14/she called her household servants. "Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew has been brought to us to make a fool of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
1:39:15/When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
1:39:16/She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
1:39:17/Then she told him the same story, saying, "The Hebrew servant you brought us came to me to make a fool of me.
1:39:18/But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
1:39:19/When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your servant treated me," he burned with anger.
1:39:20/Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. And there he was, in the prison.
1:39:21/But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
1:39:22/The warden put all the prisoners in the prison under Joseph's care; he was responsible for all that was done there.
1:39:23/The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with him and made whatever he did successful.
1:40:1/After these events, the king of Egypt's cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.
1:40:2/Pharaoh became angry with two of his officials, the head cupbearer and the head baker.
1:40:3/He imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
1:40:4/The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to attend to them, and they spent some time in custody.
1:40:5/Both of them had a dream on the same night, each dream with its own meaning, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned.
1:40:6/When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
1:40:7/He asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him, "Why do you look so downcast today?"
1:40:8/They replied, "We have had dreams, but there is no one to interpret them." Joseph said to them, "Aren't interpretations God's business? Please tell me your dreams."
1:40:9/The chief cupbearer described his dream to Joseph, saying, "In my dream, I saw a vine in front of me;
1:40:10/And on the vine were three branches. It seemed as though it budded, its blossoms bloomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
1:40:11/I had Pharaoh's cup in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in his hand."
1:40:12/Joseph told him, "This is what it means: The three branches represent three days.
1:40:13/Within three days, Pharaoh will restore your position, and you will place Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
1:40:14/But when things go well with you, please remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.
1:40:15/For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon."
1:40:16/When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream, and in my dream, there were three white baskets on my head;
1:40:17/In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
1:40:18/Joseph responded, "This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.
1:40:19/Within three days, Pharaoh will remove your head from you and hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh."
1:40:20/On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he held a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker among his servants.
1:40:21/He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand,
1:40:22/But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
1:40:23/However, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
1:41:1/After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: he was standing by the river.
1:41:2/Suddenly, seven healthy and well-fed cows came up out of the river and grazed in the meadow.
1:41:3/Then, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up after them from the river and stood beside the healthy cows on the riverbank.
1:41:4/The sickly and thin cows ate up the seven healthy and well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
1:41:5/He fell asleep again and dreamed a second time: seven ears of grain, healthy and good, grew on a single stalk.
1:41:6/After them, seven other ears of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.
1:41:7/The seven thin ears swallowed up the seven healthy, full ears. Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream.
1:41:8/In the morning, he was troubled, so he summoned all of Egypt's magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
1:41:9/Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "Today I remember my mistakes:
1:41:10/Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
1:41:11/We both had dreams on the same night, each dream with its own meaning.
1:41:12/A young Hebrew man was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
1:41:13/And things turned out exactly as he interpreted for us: I was restored to my position, and the baker was hanged."
1:41:14/Pharaoh immediately sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought out of the dungeon. He shaved, changed his clothes, and came before Pharaoh.
1:41:15/Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I've heard it said about you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it."
1:41:16/Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "I cannot do it myself, but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires."
1:41:17/Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the river:
1:41:18/And I saw seven cows, fat and healthy, come up out of the river and graze in the reed grass.
1:41:19/Then, seven other cows came up after them, miserable and very thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt for badness.
1:41:20/And the thin and sickly cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
1:41:21/But after they had eaten them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as miserable as before. Then I woke up.
1:41:22/In my dream, I also saw seven ears of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.
1:41:23/After them, seven other ears sprouted—withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind.
1:41:24/And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I told this to the magicians, but no one could explain it to me."
1:41:25/Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same: God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
1:41:26/The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; it's one and the same dream.
1:41:27/The seven thin and sickly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine.
1:41:28/This is what I have told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
1:41:29/Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
1:41:30/But seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.
1:41:31/The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows will be so severe.
1:41:32/The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.
1:41:33/Now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
1:41:34/Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
1:41:35/They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under Pharaoh's authority, to be kept in the cities for food.
1:41:36/This food will be a reserve for the country against the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."
1:41:37/This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
1:41:38/Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?"
1:41:39/Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
1:41:40/You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."
1:41:41/Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
1:41:42/Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
1:41:43/He had him ride in his second chariot, and people shouted before him, "Make way!" Thus he put him in charge of all the land of Egypt.
1:41:44/Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word, no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."
1:41:45/Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
1:41:46/Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout all the land of Egypt.
1:41:47/During the seven years of abundance, the land produced plentifully.
1:41:48/He collected all the food of these seven years in the land of Egypt and stored the food in the cities; he put in every city the food from the fields around it.
1:41:49/Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea, until he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
1:41:50/Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
1:41:51/Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, "God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household."
1:41:52/The second son he named Ephraim and said, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering."
1:41:53/The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,
1:41:54/And the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
1:41:55/When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you."
1:41:56/When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.
1:41:57/And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
1:42:1/When Jacob realized there was grain in Egypt, he asked his sons, "Why are you just standing around looking at each other?"
1:42:2/He said, "Look, I've heard there's grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so we can survive and not starve."
1:42:3/Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
1:42:4/But Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers because he was afraid something bad might happen to him.
1:42:5/So the sons of Israel went to buy grain along with others because there was a famine in the land of Canaan.
1:42:6/Joseph was in charge of the land and was the one selling grain to all the people. When Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
1:42:7/Joseph recognized his brothers, but pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. He asked, "Where are you from?" They replied, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1:42:8/Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
1:42:9/Remembering the dreams he had about them, Joseph accused them, "You've come to spy on our land's vulnerabilities."
1:42:10/They responded, "No, my lord, we've just come to buy food."
1:42:11/"We're all sons of the same man. We're honest men, not spies."
1:42:12/But he insisted, "No, you've come to see where our land is unprotected."
1:42:13/They explained, "Your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in Canaan. The youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer with us."
1:42:14/Joseph said to them, "Exactly as I said, you are spies."
1:42:15/"This is how you'll be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you won't leave here unless your youngest brother comes here."
1:42:16/"Send one of you to get your brother while the rest of you stay imprisoned. This will prove whether your story is true. If not, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies."
1:42:17/And he put them all in custody for three days.
1:42:18/On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God."
1:42:19/"If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you take grain back for your starving households."
1:42:20/"But bring your youngest brother to me so I can verify your story and you won't die." They agreed to this.
1:42:21/They said to each other, "We are truly guilty about what we did to our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us, but we wouldn't listen. That's why this trouble has come upon us."
1:42:22/Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to harm the boy? But you wouldn't listen. Now we're being held accountable for his blood."
1:42:23/They didn't realize Joseph could understand them since he was using an interpreter.
1:42:24/He turned away from them and wept. Then he came back and spoke to them again. He took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes.
1:42:25/Joseph ordered their sacks filled with grain, their money returned to each man's sack, and provisions given for their journey. This was done for them.
1:42:26/They loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
1:42:27/When one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey at the inn, he saw his money at the top of his sack.
1:42:28/He said to his brothers, "My money has been returned; it's here in my sack." Their hearts sank, and they turned to each other, trembling, saying, "What has God done to us?"
1:42:29/When they returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying,
1:42:30/"The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country."
1:42:31/"But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.'"
1:42:32/"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer with us, and the youngest is currently with our father in Canaan."
1:42:33/"Then the man, the lord of the country, said, 'This is how I will know if you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, take grain for your starving households, and go.'"
1:42:34/"'Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.'"
1:42:35/As they were emptying their sacks, they found that each man's pouch of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw the pouches of money, they were frightened.
1:42:36/Jacob their father said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is gone, Simeon is gone, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"
1:42:37/Reuben said to his father, "You can kill my two sons if I don't bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will return him."
1:42:38/But Jacob said, "My son will not go down with you. His brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If anything bad happens to him on the journey you're taking, you'll bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow."
1:43:1/The famine was severe in the land.
1:43:2/When they had finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a bit more food."
1:43:3/Judah spoke up, saying, "The man sternly warned us, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"
1:43:4/"If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
1:43:5/But if you don't send him, we won't go down because the man told us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
1:43:6/Israel asked, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man you had another brother?"
1:43:7/They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family, asking, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' We answered his questions. How could we know he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
1:43:8/Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me, and we will get up and go, so that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
1:43:9/"I will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then I will bear the blame forever.
1:43:10/"If we hadn't delayed, we could have returned twice by now."
1:43:11/Their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down a gift to the man—a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
1:43:12/"Take double the money with you, and take back the money that was returned in the mouths of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight.
1:43:13/"Take your brother also, and get up, go back to the man.
1:43:14/"May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, so that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
1:43:15/So the men took the gifts, double the money, and Benjamin; they got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
1:43:16/When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house manager, "Bring these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal, for these men will dine with me at noon."
1:43:17/The man did as Joseph ordered and brought the men to Joseph's house.
1:43:18/But the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, thinking, "We were brought here because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, so he could accuse us, attack us, and take us as slaves along with our donkeys."
1:43:19/So they approached Joseph's steward and spoke with him at the entrance of the house,
1:43:20/and said, "Oh, sir, we indeed came down initially to buy food.
1:43:21/"But when we arrived at the lodging place and opened our sacks, each of us found his money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full amount. So we have brought it back with us.
1:43:22/"We have also brought additional money with us to buy food. We don't know who put our money in our sacks."
1:43:23/He replied, "Be at ease, do not be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
1:43:24/The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet, and provided feed for their donkeys.
1:43:25/They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.
1:43:26/When Joseph arrived home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.
1:43:27/He inquired about their well-being and asked, "Is your father, the old man you mentioned, well? Is he still alive?"
1:43:28/They replied, "Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive." And they bowed respectfully.
1:43:29/He looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" Then he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son."
1:43:30/Joseph hurried out because he was deeply moved by the sight of his brother, and he looked for a place to weep. He entered his private room and wept there.
1:43:31/Then he washed his face, came out, and composed himself before saying, "Serve the meal."
1:43:32/They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.
1:43:33/They were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. The men looked at each other in astonishment.
1:43:34/He sent portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They feasted and drank freely with him.
1:44:1/He instructed the manager of his household, "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and place each man's money in the opening of his sack."
1:44:2/"Also, place my silver cup in the opening of the youngest one's sack, along with the money for his grain." And he did exactly as Joseph had instructed.
1:44:3/As soon as it was dawn, the men were sent on their way, along with their donkeys.
1:44:4/When they had just left the city and weren't far away, Joseph said to his steward, "Go, follow the men; and when you catch up to them, ask them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?'
1:44:5/'Isn't this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? You have done something wrong by taking it.'"
1:44:6/He caught up with them and relayed these exact words.
1:44:7/They responded, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!
1:44:8/Look, the money we found in our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
1:44:9/If any of your servants is found to have it, let him die, and we also will become my lord's slaves."
1:44:10/He said, "Let it be as you say: the one who is found with it will become my slave, but the rest of you will be innocent."
1:44:11/So they quickly lowered their sacks to the ground and each opened his sack.
1:44:12/He searched, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
1:44:13/Then they tore their clothes, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city.
1:44:14/Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph's house, where he was still present, and they fell to the ground before him.
1:44:15/Joseph asked them, "What have you done? Don't you realize that a man like me can certainly find things out through divination?"
1:44:16/Judah replied, "What can we say to my lord? How can we explain ourselves? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt. Here we are, my lord's slaves—both we and the one who was found with the cup."
1:44:17/But he said, "Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found with the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace."
1:44:18/Then Judah approached him and said, "Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't be angry with your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.
1:44:19/My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'
1:44:20/And we answered my lord, 'We have an elderly father, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'
1:44:21/Then you told your servants, 'Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.'
1:44:22/We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.'
1:44:23/But you told your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
1:44:24/When we went back to your servant, my father, we told him what my lord had said.
1:44:25/Our father told us, 'Go back and buy a little more food.'
1:44:26/But we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down, for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
1:44:27/Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
1:44:28/One of them went away from me, and I said, "He must have been torn to pieces," and I haven't seen him since.
1:44:29/If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray hair down to the grave in sorrow.'
1:44:30/Now, if I go back to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us—since his life is closely bound up with the boy's life—
1:44:31/it will happen that when he sees the boy is not with us, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant, our father, down to the grave in sorrow.
1:44:32/For your servant guaranteed the boy's safety to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before my father for all my life.'
1:44:33/Now, please let your servant stay here as my lord's slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
1:44:34/For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I cannot bear to see the distress that would come upon my father."
1:45:1/Then Joseph couldn't hold back in front of everyone who was there; he shouted, "Make everyone leave me." And no one stayed with him while Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers.
1:45:2/And he cried loudly: and the Egyptians and Pharaoh's household heard it.
1:45:3/And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph; is my father still alive?" But his brothers couldn't respond because they were shocked to see him.
1:45:4/Then Joseph told his brothers, "Please come closer to me." When they did, he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, the one you sold into Egypt."
1:45:5/So now, don't be upset or angry with yourselves for selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you to save lives.
1:45:6/For the past two years, there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years, there will be no plowing or harvesting.
1:45:7/But God sent me ahead of you to ensure you have descendants on the earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary way.
1:45:8/So, it wasn't you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh, the lord of his entire household, and ruler over all of Egypt.
1:45:9/Quickly go to my father and tell him, 'Your son Joseph says, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay.'
1:45:10/You will live in the land of Goshen, and you'll be close to me—you, your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and everything you own.
1:45:11/And I will provide for you there, because five more years of famine are coming, otherwise you, your household, and all that you have might come to poverty.
1:45:12/And now, you see with your own eyes, and so does my brother Benjamin, that it is really me speaking to you.
1:45:13/Tell my father about all the honor I've received in Egypt and everything you've seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.
1:45:14/Then he embraced his brother Benjamin and cried, and Benjamin cried on his shoulder.
1:45:15/He also kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward, his brothers talked with him.
1:45:16/When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and his officials were pleased.
1:45:17/Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan;
1:45:18/And bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat from the richness of the land.'
1:45:19/Now you are ordered to do this: Take carts from Egypt for your children and wives, and bring your father and come.
1:45:20/Don't worry about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours."
1:45:21/And the children of Israel did so: Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and provided them with supplies for their journey.
1:45:22/To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothes.
1:45:23/And to his father, he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his father on the journey.
1:45:24/So he sent his brothers off, and as they were leaving, he told them, "Don't argue on the way."
1:45:25/And they left Egypt and returned to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob,
1:45:26/And told him, "Joseph is still alive, and he is the ruler over all the land of Egypt." Jacob's heart nearly stopped because he didn't believe them.
1:45:27/But when they recounted all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob was revived.
1:45:28/And Israel said, "Enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
1:46:1/Israel set out with all he had, reached Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
1:46:2/That night, God spoke to Israel in a dream, saying, "Jacob, Jacob." And he replied, "Here I am."
1:46:3/He said, "I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.
1:46:4/I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph will close your eyes when you pass away."
1:46:5/Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons carried him, their little ones, and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent.
1:46:6/They brought their livestock and possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him.
1:46:7/His sons, grandsons, daughters, and granddaughters—all his descendants—he brought with him to Egypt.
1:46:8/Here are the names of the descendants of Israel who went to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
1:46:9/Reuben's sons were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
1:46:10/Simeon's sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
1:46:11/Levi's sons were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1:46:12/Judah's sons were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. But Er and Onan died in Canaan. Perez's sons were Hezron and Hamul.
1:46:13/Issachar's sons were Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron.
1:46:14/Zebulun's sons were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
1:46:15/These were Leah's sons, born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, along with his daughter Dinah. The total number of his sons and daughters was thirty-three.
1:46:16/Gad's sons were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
1:46:17/Asher's sons were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel.
1:46:18/These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She bore these to Jacob—sixteen people in total.
1:46:19/Rachel, Jacob's wife, bore Joseph and Benjamin.
1:46:20/In Egypt, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, born to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
1:46:21/Benjamin's sons were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
1:46:22/These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen people in total.
1:46:23/Dan's son was Hushim.
1:46:24/Naphtali's sons were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
1:46:25/These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore these to Jacob—seven people in total.
1:46:26/All the people who came with Jacob to Egypt, who were his direct descendants, not including his sons' wives, numbered sixty-six.
1:46:27/And Joseph had two sons born in Egypt, making the total number of people in Jacob's family who came to Egypt seventy.
1:46:28/Jacob sent Judah ahead to Joseph to get directions to Goshen, and when they arrived in Goshen,
1:46:29/Joseph prepared his chariot and went to meet his father Israel in Goshen. He presented himself to him, hugged his neck, and wept for a long time.
1:46:30/Israel said to Joseph, "Now I can die in peace, since I have seen your face and know you are still alive."
1:46:31/Joseph told his brothers and his father's household, "I'll go up and inform Pharaoh, telling him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in Canaan, have come to me.
1:46:32/The men are shepherds; they've always taken care of livestock. They've brought their flocks, herds, and everything they own.'
1:46:33/When Pharaoh calls for you and asks about your occupation,
1:46:34/you should say, 'Your servants have been livestock keepers from our youth till now, both we and our ancestors.' This way, you can live in the region of Goshen, since all shepherds are looked down upon by the Egyptians."
1:47:1/Then Joseph went to Pharaoh and said, "My father, my brothers, their livestock, and everything they own have come from the land of Canaan. Now, they are in the region of Goshen."
1:47:2/He brought five of his brothers and introduced them to Pharaoh.
1:47:3/Pharaoh asked his brothers, "What do you do for a living?" They answered Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, just like our ancestors."
1:47:4/They also said to Pharaoh, "We've come to live here temporarily because there's no pasture for our flocks in Canaan due to the severe famine. So, please let us stay in Goshen."
1:47:5/Pharaoh told Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you."
1:47:6/"The land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock."
1:47:7/Joseph introduced his father Jacob to Pharaoh, and Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing.
1:47:8/Pharaoh asked Jacob, "How old are you?"
1:47:9/Jacob told Pharaoh, "I've been on this journey for 130 years. My life has been short and difficult, and I haven't lived as long as my ancestors did during their journeys."
1:47:10/After blessing Pharaoh again, Jacob left his presence.
1:47:11/Joseph settled his father and brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, in the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed.
1:47:12/Joseph provided for his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food according to the number of their dependents.
1:47:13/The famine was so severe that there was no food in all the land; both Egypt and Canaan were exhausted by the famine.
1:47:14/Joseph collected all the money found in Egypt and Canaan in exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace.
1:47:15/When the money in Egypt and Canaan ran out, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die in front of you? The money is gone."
1:47:16/Joseph said, "Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock if you're out of money."
1:47:17/So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
1:47:18/When that year ended, they came to him the next year and said, "We won't hide from you that our money is spent; you have our livestock, and there's nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our land.
1:47:19/Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will become servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed so we can live and not die, and the land won't become desolate."
1:47:20/So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold their field because the famine was too severe for them. Thus, the land became Pharaoh's.
1:47:21/He moved the people to cities from one end of Egypt's borders to the other.
1:47:22/But he did not buy the land of the priests because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had enough food from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they didn't sell their land.
1:47:23/Then Joseph said to the people, "Look, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you to sow the land.
1:47:24/When the crops come in, give one-fifth to Pharaoh. The other four parts will be yours as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves, your households, and your children."
1:47:25/They said, "You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
1:47:26/Joseph established it as a law across the land of Egypt to this day that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests, which did not become Pharaoh's.
1:47:27/And Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there, became fruitful, and multiplied greatly.
1:47:28/Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years, so he lived a total of 147 years.
1:47:29/When the time approached for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please place your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and faithfully with me. Do not bury me in Egypt.
1:47:30/But let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." Joseph replied, "I will do as you have said."
1:47:31/He said, "Swear to me." And Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed in gratitude at the head of his bed.
1:48:1/After these events, someone informed Joseph, "Look, your father is ill." So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him.
1:48:2/Someone informed Jacob, saying, "Look, your son Joseph is coming to you." Israel gathered his strength and sat up in bed.
1:48:3/Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in Canaan and blessed me,
1:48:4/And told me, 'I will make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will turn you into a community of peoples and will give this land to your descendants as a permanent inheritance.'
1:48:5/Now, your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in Egypt before I arrived here, will be considered as my own, just like Reuben and Simeon.
1:48:6/Any children you have after them will be yours and will inherit their land under the names of their brothers.
1:48:7/When I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died in Canaan, not far from Ephrath, so I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
1:48:8/Israel saw Joseph's sons and asked, "Who are these?"
1:48:9/Joseph told his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." He said, "Please bring them to me so I can bless them."
1:48:10/Israel's eyes were weak from age and he couldn't see well. He brought them close, kissed them, and embraced them.
1:48:11/Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face again, but now God has let me see your children too."
1:48:12/Joseph moved them away from his knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
1:48:13/Joseph took both of them, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them close to him.
1:48:14/Israel extended his right hand and placed it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, crossing his hands intentionally; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
1:48:15/He blessed Joseph and said, "God, whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked before, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
1:48:16/The Angel who has delivered me from all harm, bless these boys. May they carry on my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude on the earth."
1:48:17/When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim's head, he was displeased; he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
1:48:18/Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."
1:48:19/But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations."
1:48:20/He blessed them that day, saying, "By you, Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" He put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
1:48:21/Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your ancestors."
1:48:22/Furthermore, I have given you one more portion than your brothers, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.
1:49:1/Jacob called his sons together and said, "Come together so I can tell you what will happen to you in the future."
1:49:2/"Gather around, and listen, sons of Jacob; pay attention to Israel, your father."
1:49:3/Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength, and the first sign of my virility, the most distinguished in dignity and power.
1:49:4/But you are as unstable as water and will not excel because you slept in your father's bed, thus defiling it—he went up to my bed.
1:49:5/Simeon and Levi are brothers; they use violence as their tool.
1:49:6/I want nothing to do with their schemes; don't let me be associated with their gatherings. For in their anger, they killed a man, and on a whim, they crippled oxen.
1:49:7/May their anger be cursed, for it was fierce; and their fury, for it was ruthless. I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel.
1:49:8/Judah, your brothers will praise you; you will grasp your enemies by the neck; your father's sons will bow down to you.
1:49:9/Judah is like a young lion: from the kill, my son, you have ascended. He crouches and lies down like a lion, like a mighty lion—who dares to rouse him?
1:49:10/The scepter will not leave Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him will the obedience of the peoples be.
1:49:11/He ties his foal to the vine, his donkey's colt to the best vine. He washes his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.
1:49:12/His eyes will be darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
1:49:13/Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.
1:49:14/Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds.
1:49:15/He saw that rest was good and the land was pleasant; so he bent his shoulder to bear the burden and became a laborer.
1:49:16/Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
1:49:17/Dan will be a snake on the road, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so its rider falls backward.
1:49:18/I look forward to your salvation, O LORD.
1:49:19/Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.
1:49:20/Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king.
1:49:21/Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
1:49:22/Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over the wall.
1:49:23/Archers attacked him with hostility; they shot at him and held a grudge.
1:49:24/Yet his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.
1:49:25/Because of the God of your father who will help you, because of the Almighty who will bless you with blessings from the heavens above, blessings from the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts and womb.
1:49:26/The blessings of your father surpass the blessings of my ancestors, reaching to the heights of the eternal hills. They will be on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
1:49:27/Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the plunder.
1:49:28/These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
1:49:29/Then he instructed them, saying, "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
1:49:30/in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.
1:49:31/There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah.
1:49:32/The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites."
1:49:33/When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet up into the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
1:50:1/Joseph threw himself on his father's face, cried over him, and kissed him.
1:50:2/Joseph ordered his servants, the doctors, to preserve his father's body, and the doctors did so to Israel.
1:50:3/It took forty days to complete the process, as this is the standard time for embalming. The Egyptians grieved for him for seventy days.
1:50:4/After the mourning period ended, Joseph approached Pharaoh's household and said, "If I have found favor with you, please tell Pharaoh that 
1:50:5/my father made me promise, saying, 'When I die, bury me in my own tomb that I have prepared in the land of Canaan.' So please let me go and bury my father, and I will return."
1:50:6/Pharaoh responded, "Go and bury your father, as he made you promise."
1:50:7/So Joseph went to bury his father, accompanied by all of Pharaoh's servants, the senior members of his household, and all the senior figures of Egypt,
1:50:8/along with all of Joseph's family, his brothers, and his father's family. They left only their young children, their flocks, and their herds in Goshen.
1:50:9/A large procession including chariots and horsemen accompanied him, forming a very grand entourage.
1:50:10/When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they held a very large and solemn funeral ceremony for seven days.
1:50:11/Seeing the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, the local Canaanites remarked, "This is a deep mourning by the Egyptians." Therefore, the place was named Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
1:50:12/His sons did exactly as he had instructed them:
1:50:13/They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.
1:50:14/After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and everyone who had gone with him to the burial.
1:50:15/When Joseph's brothers realized their father was dead, they said, "Joseph might still be holding a grudge against us and could decide to pay us back for all the wrong we did to him."
1:50:16/So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Before he died, your father left instructions, saying,
1:50:17/'Please forgive your brothers for their wrongdoing and sin, for they did treat you badly.' Now, we ask you to forgive the sins of the servants of your father's God." Joseph cried when they spoke to him.
1:50:18/Then his brothers also came, fell down before him, and said, "We are your slaves."
1:50:19/But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
1:50:20/You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
1:50:21/So now, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children." And he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.
1:50:22/Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with his father's family, and lived to be a hundred and ten years old.
1:50:23/Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's children, and also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees.
1:50:24/And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and lead you out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
1:50:25/Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, "God will surely take care of you, and you must carry my bones up from this place."
1:50:26/So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. After they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
2:1:1/Here are the names of the Israelites who moved to Egypt; each one, along with his family, followed Jacob.
2:1:2/Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
2:1:3/Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
2:1:4/Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
2:1:5/In total, seventy descendants of Jacob moved to Egypt, since Joseph was already there.
2:1:6/And Joseph passed away, along with all his brothers and that entire generation.
2:1:7/The Israelites were very fruitful, increased rapidly, multiplied, and became extremely powerful; the land was filled with them.
2:1:8/A new king came to power in Egypt who did not know about Joseph.
2:1:9/He said to his people, "Look, the Israelite population is larger and stronger than we are.
2:1:10/Let's be smart about this; otherwise, they'll multiply even more, and if war breaks out, they might join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country."
2:1:11/So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built Pithom and Raamses as storage cities for Pharaoh.
2:1:12/But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
2:1:13/The Egyptians forced the Israelites to work under harsh conditions.
2:1:14/They made their lives miserable with hard labor, making mortar and bricks, and doing all kinds of work in the fields. Every task they were forced to do was harsh.
2:1:15/The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one named Shiphrah and the other Puah.
2:1:16/He said, "When you help the Hebrew women during childbirth, look at the sex of the baby. If it's a boy, kill him; if it's a girl, let her live."
2:1:17/But the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live.
2:1:18/The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"
2:1:19/The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."
2:1:20/So God was good to the midwives, and the people continued to multiply and became very strong.
2:1:21/And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
2:1:22/Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."
2:2:1/A man from the Levi family married a Levi woman.
2:2:2/The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Seeing that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.
2:2:3/When she could no longer hide him, she made a basket from papyrus, sealed it with tar and pitch, placed the child inside, and set it among the reeds along the riverbank.
2:2:4/His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
2:2:5/Pharaoh's daughter went down to bathe in the river, while her attendants walked along the riverbank. Spotting the basket among the reeds, she sent her servant to get it.
2:2:6/Upon opening it, she saw the baby crying and felt sorry for him, realizing, "This is one of the Hebrew babies."
2:2:7/Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you?"
2:2:8/Pharaoh's daughter told her, "Go." So the girl went and called the baby's mother.
2:2:9/Pharaoh's daughter instructed her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I'll pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
2:2:10/When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
2:2:11/As Moses grew up, he went out to his people and observed their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
2:2:12/Looking around and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
2:2:13/The next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting and asked the aggressor, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"
2:2:14/The man retorted, "Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? Do you plan to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Moses was afraid, thinking, "What I did must have become known."
2:2:15/When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.
2:2:16/The priest of Midian had seven daughters who came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.
2:2:17/Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up, helped the women, and watered their flock.
2:2:18/When they returned to Reuel, their father, he asked, "How did you come back so quickly today?"
2:2:19/They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, even drawing enough water for us and watering the flock."
2:2:20/He asked his daughters, "Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite him to have something to eat."
2:2:21/Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
2:2:22/She gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land."
2:2:23/Over time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
2:2:24/God heard their moaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
2:2:25/God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
2:3:1/Moses was taking care of the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
2:3:2/An angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. He saw that the bush was on fire, but it didn't burn up.
2:3:3/Moses thought, "I'll go over and see this amazing sight—why the bush doesn't burn up."
2:3:4/When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses, Moses!" And Moses replied, "Here I am."
2:3:5/Then God said, "Don't come any closer. Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
2:3:6/He continued, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.
2:3:7/Then the LORD said, "I have definitely seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I've heard their cries against their slave drivers. I am aware of their pain.
2:3:8/So I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2:3:9/Now, the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them.
2:3:10/So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."
2:3:11/But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
2:3:12/And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."
2:3:13/Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"
2:3:14/God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
2:3:15/God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation.
2:3:16/Go, gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
2:3:17/And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.'
2:3:18/They will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel will go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'
2:3:19/But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
2:3:20/So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
2:3:21/And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not leave empty-handed.
2:3:22/Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.
2:4:1/Moses responded, "But what if they don't believe me or listen to me? They might say, 'The LORD hasn't appeared to you.'"
2:4:2/And the LORD asked him, "What's that in your hand?" He replied, "A staff."
2:4:3/He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it turned into a snake; and Moses ran from it.
2:4:4/Then the LORD told Moses, "Reach out your hand and grab it by the tail." So he reached out his hand, caught it, and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
2:4:5/This is so they will believe that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to you.
2:4:6/Then the LORD said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." He put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, white as snow.
2:4:7/He said, "Put your hand back into your cloak." So he put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, just like the rest of his flesh.
2:4:8/If they don't believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they might believe the second sign.
2:4:9/But if they don't believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will turn into blood on the ground.
2:4:10/Moses said to the LORD, "Please, Lord, I've never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you've spoken to your servant. I'm slow of speech and tongue."
2:4:11/And the LORD said to him, "Who gave humans their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
2:4:12/Now go, and I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."
2:4:13/But Moses said, "Please, Lord, send someone else."
2:4:14/Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses, and he said, "Isn't Aaron, the Levite, your brother? I know he can speak well. Look, he is on his way to meet you, and he will be happy to see you.
2:4:15/You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
2:4:16/He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
2:4:17/And take this staff in your hand, with which you'll perform the signs."
2:4:18/Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see if they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
2:4:19/And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."
2:4:20/So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and started back to Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.
2:4:21/And the LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so he will not let the people go.
2:4:22/Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,
2:4:23/and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"
2:4:24/On the journey, at a lodging place, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him.
2:4:25/But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin, and touched Moses' feet with it, saying, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!"
2:4:26/So the LORD let him alone. At that time she said, "A bridegroom of blood," referring to the circumcision.
2:4:27/And the LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
2:4:28/Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs he had commanded him to perform.
2:4:29/Moses and Aaron gathered all the elders of the Israelites,
2:4:30/and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
2:4:31/and the people believed. When they heard that the LORD had visited the Israelites and seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
2:5:1/Then Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so they can celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.'"
2:5:2/Pharaoh responded, "Who is the LORD that I should listen to His command to let Israel go? I do not recognize the LORD, and I will not let Israel go."
2:5:3/They replied, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, to avoid being struck with plagues or the sword."
2:5:4/But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why are you distracting the people from their work? Get back to your labor."
2:5:5/Pharaoh also said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you want them to stop their work."
2:5:6/That same day, Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:
2:5:7/"Do not supply any more straw for the people to make bricks as before. Let them go and gather their own straw.
2:5:8/But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that's why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
2:5:9/Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."
2:5:10/So the slave drivers and overseers went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not provide you with straw.
2:5:11/Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"
2:5:12/So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
2:5:13/The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."
2:5:14/And the Israelite overseers, whom Pharaoh's slave drivers had set over them, were beaten and asked, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"
2:5:15/Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh, "Why are you treating your servants this way?
2:5:16/No straw is given to your servants, yet they tell us, 'Make bricks!' See, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."
2:5:17/But he said, "You are lazy, lazy! That's why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
2:5:18/Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."
2:5:19/The Israelite overseers realized they were in a bad situation when they were told, "You must not reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day."
2:5:20/When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,
2:5:21/and they said to them, "May the LORD look on you and judge! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
2:5:22/Moses went back to the LORD and asked, "LORD, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why did you send me?
2:5:23/Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."
2:6:1/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."
2:6:2/And God spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD."
2:6:3/And I revealed myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH, I was not known to them.
2:6:4/And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they were foreigners.
2:6:5/And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in slavery; and I have remembered my covenant.
2:6:6/Therefore, tell the children of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will free you from their slavery, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.'
2:6:7/And I will take you as my people, and I will be your God: and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
2:6:8/And I will bring you into the land, which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as a heritage: I am the LORD."
2:6:9/And Moses relayed this to the children of Israel: but they did not listen to Moses because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.
2:6:10/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:6:11/Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
2:6:12/And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, "Look, the children of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, when I am not eloquent?"
2:6:13/And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
2:6:14/These are the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben.
2:6:15/And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman: these are the families of Simeon.
2:6:16/And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the lifespan of Levi was one hundred thirty-seven years.
2:6:17/The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
2:6:18/And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the lifespan of Kohath was one hundred thirty-three years.
2:6:19/And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.
2:6:20/And Amram married Jochebed, his father's sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the lifespan of Amram was one hundred and thirty-seven years.
2:6:21/And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
2:6:22/And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
2:6:23/And Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
2:6:24/And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.
2:6:25/And Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
2:6:26/These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies."
2:6:27/These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
2:6:28/And it happened on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
2:6:29/That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD: speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you."
2:6:30/And Moses said before the LORD, "Look, I am not eloquent, how will Pharaoh listen to me?"
2:7:1/The LORD said to Moses, "Look, I have made you like a god to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
2:7:2/You must say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron will tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave his land.
2:7:3/I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn and will perform many miracles and wonders in Egypt.
2:7:4/But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I can demonstrate my power in Egypt and lead my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt through mighty acts of judgment.
2:7:5/And the Egyptians will realize that I am the LORD when I show my power in Egypt and free the Israelites from among them.
2:7:6/Moses and Aaron did exactly as the LORD commanded them.
2:7:7/Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
2:7:8/The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
2:7:9/When Pharaoh demands a miracle, tell Aaron to throw his staff down in front of Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.
2:7:10/Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the LORD had instructed; Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.
2:7:11/Then Pharaoh called for his wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same with their magic.
2:7:12/They each threw down their staffs, which also became snakes, but Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
2:7:13/Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
2:7:14/The LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.
2:7:15/Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water, wait by the riverbank to meet him, and take the staff that turned into a snake in your hand.
2:7:16/Tell him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now, you have not listened.
2:7:17/This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD. I will strike the water of the river with the staff in my hand, and it will turn to blood.
2:7:18/The fish in the river will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink its water.
2:7:19/The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron to take his staff and stretch out his hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, their canals, their ponds, and all their pools of water—so they may turn to blood. There will be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt, even in containers of wood and stone."
2:7:20/Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded; Aaron raised the staff and struck the water of the river in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, and all the water in the river turned to blood.
2:7:21/The fish in the river died, the river smelled bad, and the Egyptians couldn't drink its water. There was blood throughout the land of Egypt.
2:7:22/But the Egyptian magicians did the same with their magic, and Pharaoh's heart remained hardened. He did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
2:7:23/Pharaoh turned and went back to his palace, not taking even this to heart.
2:7:24/And all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink because they couldn't drink the water from the river.
2:7:25/Seven days passed after the LORD struck the river.
2:8:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so they can worship me.'"
2:8:2/But if you refuse to release them, watch out, because I will fill your entire territory with frogs.
2:8:3/The river will swarm with frogs. They will enter your house, your bedroom, onto your bed, into the homes of your servants and your people, into your ovens, and your dough bowls.
2:8:4/The frogs will be all over you, your people, and all your servants.
2:8:5/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron to stretch out his hand with his staff over the rivers, canals, and ponds, and bring up frogs over the land of Egypt."
2:8:6/So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
2:8:7/But the magicians used their magic to do the same thing and brought frogs over the land of Egypt.
2:8:8/Then Pharaoh urgently called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
2:8:9/Moses said to Pharaoh, "You have the honor of telling me when I should pray for you, your officials, and your people, to get rid of the frogs from your houses and leave them only in the river."
2:8:10/Pharaoh said, "Tomorrow." Moses replied, "It will be as you say, so you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
2:8:11/The frogs will leave you, your houses, your officials, and your people; they will remain only in the river."
2:8:12/Then Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs He had brought on Pharaoh.
2:8:13/And the LORD did what Moses asked; the frogs died in the houses, courtyards, and fields.
2:8:14/They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.
2:8:15/But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as the LORD had predicted.
2:8:16/Then the LORD told Moses, "Tell Aaron to stretch out his staff and strike the dust of the ground, and throughout Egypt the dust will become lice."
2:8:17/They did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, struck the dust of the earth, and it turned into lice on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became lice.
2:8:18/But when the magicians tried to produce lice by their secret arts, they could not. So there were lice on people and animals.
2:8:19/Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
2:8:20/And the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so they can worship me.'"
2:8:21/Otherwise, if you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, your people, and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground will be covered with them.
2:8:22/But on that day, I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people live, so no swarms of flies will be there. This way you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land.
2:8:23/I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will happen tomorrow.'"
2:8:24/And the LORD did so. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials. Throughout Egypt, the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.
2:8:25/Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, offer sacrifices to your God here in the land."
2:8:26/But Moses said, "It wouldn't be right to do that, for we would be offering the Egyptians' detestable things to the LORD our God. If we do, won't the Egyptians stone us?"
2:8:27/"We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us."
2:8:28/Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but don't go too far. Pray for me."
2:8:29/Moses said, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will leave Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But let Pharaoh not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
2:8:30/Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
2:8:31/And the LORD did as Moses asked; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not one fly remained.
2:8:32/But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and did not let the people go.
2:9:1/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so they can worship me.'
2:9:2/If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them,
2:9:3/Be aware that the LORD's hand will strike your livestock in the fields—the horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, and sheep—with a devastating plague.
2:9:4/But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that none of Israel's animals will die."
2:9:5/And the LORD set a specific time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land."
2:9:6/And the next day, the LORD did as He had said, causing all the livestock of Egypt to die, but not one of the livestock of the Israelites died.
2:9:7/Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the livestock of the Israelites had died. Yet Pharaoh's heart remained unyielding, and he did not let the people go.
2:9:8/Then the LORD told Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace, and have Moses toss it into the air in front of Pharaoh.
2:9:9/It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and cause festering boils to break out on people and animals throughout the land."
2:9:10/So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh; Moses tossed it into the air, and it caused festering boils to break out on people and animals.
2:9:11/The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils affected the magicians and all the Egyptians.
2:9:12/But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had told Moses.
2:9:13/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh, and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so they can worship me.
2:9:14/For this time I will send all my plagues to your very heart, and on your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
2:9:15/By now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
2:9:16/But I have raised you up for this very purpose, to show you my power and to have my name proclaimed in all the earth.
2:9:17/Are you still exalting yourself against my people by not letting them go?
2:9:18/Tomorrow at this time I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded till now.
2:9:19/Therefore, send now and gather your livestock and everything you have in the field. For upon every person and animal found in the field and not brought home, the hail will fall, and they will die.'"
2:9:20/Those among Pharaoh's officials who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their servants and livestock inside to safety.
2:9:21/But those who did not take the word of the LORD seriously left their servants and livestock in the field.
2:9:22/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people, animals, and all the plants of the field throughout the land of Egypt."
2:9:23/Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.
2:9:24/There was hail, and lightning flashing within the hail, very severe, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
2:9:25/The hail struck everything in the fields, both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and shattered every tree.
2:9:26/Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, was there no hail.
2:9:27/Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them, "This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
2:9:28/Plead with the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer."
2:9:29/Moses replied, "As soon as I leave the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop, and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth belongs to the LORD.
2:9:30/But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God."
2:9:31/The flax and barley were destroyed, because the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
2:9:32/But the wheat and spelt were not destroyed, for they ripen later.
2:9:33/Moses left Pharaoh and the city, spread out his hands to the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
2:9:34/When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had ceased, he sinned again: he and his officials hardened their hearts.
2:9:35/Pharaoh's heart was unyielding, and he did not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.
2:10:1/And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart and the hearts of his officials stubborn so I can display my signs to them.
2:10:2/So you can tell your children and grandchildren about what I have done in Egypt and the signs I performed among them; and you will know that I am the LORD."
2:10:3/Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so they can worship me.
2:10:4/If you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
2:10:5/They will cover the surface of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will eat what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.
2:10:6/They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
2:10:7/Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a trap for us? Let the people go, so they can worship the LORD their God. Don't you realize yet that Egypt is ruined?"
2:10:8/Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. He said to them, "Go, worship the LORD your God. But exactly who will be going?"
2:10:9/Moses answered, "We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."
2:10:10/Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly, you are bent on evil.
2:10:11/No! Have only the men go and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." And they were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.
2:10:12/And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."
2:10:13/So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind across the land all that day and all that night. By morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.
2:10:14/The locusts invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country. It was unprecedented; never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
2:10:15/They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—every plant in the fields and all the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
2:10:16/Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
2:10:17/Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me."
2:10:18/Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
2:10:19/And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
2:10:20/But the LORD made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not let the Israelites go.
2:10:21/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt."
2:10:22/So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.
2:10:23/No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
2:10:24/Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."
2:10:25/But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.
2:10:26/Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we won't know what we are to use to worship the LORD."
2:10:27/But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
2:10:28/Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."
2:10:29/Moses replied, "You have spoken well. I will never see your face again."
2:11:1/And the LORD said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and Egypt; after that, he will let you leave. When he does, he will urgently send you all away.
2:11:2/Tell the people to ask their Egyptian neighbors for silver and gold jewelry.
2:11:3/And the LORD made the Egyptians view the Israelites favorably. Also, Moses was highly respected in Egypt, by Pharaoh's officials and the people.
2:11:4/And Moses declared, "This is what the LORD says: At midnight, I will move through Egypt.
2:11:5/Every firstborn in Egypt will die, from Pharaoh's firstborn, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the servant girl at the mill, and even the firstborn of all livestock.
2:11:6/There will be a loud wailing across Egypt, unlike anything before or ever again.
2:11:7/But among the Israelites, not even a dog will bark at any person or animal. This will show you that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
2:11:8/Then all your officials will come to me, bowing down and saying, 'Leave, you and all the people who follow you!' After that, I will leave." And he left Pharaoh's presence, furious.
2:11:9/And the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my miracles may be multiplied in Egypt."
2:11:10/Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Pharaoh, but the LORD made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, so he wouldn't let the Israelites leave his country.
2:12:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, saying,
2:12:2/This month is to be the start of months for you; it will be the first month of the year for you.
2:12:3/Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man must get a lamb for his family, one lamb per household.
2:12:4/If a household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, based on the number of people; you are to determine the amount of lamb needed in proportion to what each person will eat.
2:12:5/Your lamb must be perfect, a year-old male, chosen from the sheep or the goats.
2:12:6/You must care for it until the fourteenth day of the month, when the entire assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter the lambs at twilight.
2:12:7/Then they must take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.
2:12:8/That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
2:12:9/Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs, and internal organs.
2:12:10/Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.
2:12:11/This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.
2:12:12/For I will pass through Egypt tonight and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.
2:12:13/The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
2:12:14/This day will be a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.
2:12:15/For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day, remove the yeast from your houses. Anyone who eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh day must be cut off from Israel.
2:12:16/On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.
2:12:17/Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
2:12:18/In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day, you must eat unleavened bread.
2:12:19/For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel.
2:12:20/Do not eat anything with yeast; wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.
2:12:21/Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.
2:12:22/Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning.
2:12:23/For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians; when he sees the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe, the LORD will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
2:12:24/Keep this ceremony as a permanent ordinance for you and your descendants.
2:12:25/When you enter the land the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.
2:12:26/And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?'
2:12:27/then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
2:12:28/The Israelites went and did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
2:12:29/At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
2:12:30/Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
2:12:31/He summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said, "Get up and leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.
2:12:32/Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."
2:12:33/The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"
2:12:34/So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.
2:12:35/The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.
2:12:36/The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.
2:12:37/The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
2:12:38/A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
2:12:39/They baked unleavened cakes from the dough they had brought out of Egypt. It was not leavened because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.
2:12:40/The time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
2:12:41/At the end of the four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the LORD's divisions left Egypt.
2:12:42/This is a night of vigil to honor the LORD for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This is a night to be observed for the LORD by all the Israelites throughout their generations.
2:12:43/And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the regulation for the Passover: No foreigner may eat it.
2:12:44/But any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him.
2:12:45/Neither a foreigner nor a hired worker may eat it.
2:12:46/It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
2:12:47/The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
2:12:48/If a foreigner residing among you wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover, all his males must be circumcised, and then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it.
2:12:49/The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.
2:12:50/All the Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
2:12:51/On that very day, the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
2:13:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:13:2/Dedicate to me every firstborn, the first to come from the womb among the Israelites, both humans and animals; they belong to me.
2:13:3/And Moses told the people, "Remember this day when you left Egypt, the place of slavery, because the LORD led you out of there with a mighty hand; no bread with yeast shall be eaten.
2:13:4/Today, you are leaving in the month of Abib.
2:13:5/When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which he promised to your ancestors to give you—a land flowing with milk and honey—you must perform this ceremony in this month.
2:13:6/For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, and on the seventh day, there will be a celebration in honor of the LORD.
2:13:7/Bread without yeast must be eaten for seven days; no bread with yeast shall be seen with you, nor shall yeast be seen anywhere within your territories.
2:13:8/And you shall explain to your son on that day, 'This is done because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
2:13:9/It will serve as a sign on your hand and as a reminder between your eyes, so the LORD's law may be in your mouth; for the LORD brought you out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
2:13:10/Therefore, you must keep this decree at its appointed time year after year.
2:13:11/When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your ancestors, and gives it to you,
2:13:12/You must dedicate to the LORD every first offspring of the womb, and every firstborn male of your livestock belongs to the LORD.
2:13:13/Every firstborn donkey you must redeem with a lamb; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. And you must redeem every firstborn among your sons.
2:13:14/When in the future your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall answer, 'With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.'
2:13:15/And it happened that when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human and animal. That is why I sacrifice to the LORD every male that opens the womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.
2:13:16/It will serve as a symbol on your hand and as an emblem on your forehead that with a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.
2:13:17/When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the land of the Philistines, although that was shorter. For God said, 'Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.'
2:13:18/But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt prepared for battle.
2:13:19/And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, 'God will surely take notice of you, and then you must carry my bones away from here with you.'
2:13:20/They journeyed from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
2:13:21/And the LORD went ahead of them by day in a pillar of cloud to guide them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so they could travel by day and night.
2:13:22/The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
2:14:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:14:2/Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baalzephon. You are to camp by the sea, right in front of it.
2:14:3/Pharaoh will think the Israelites are trapped in the wilderness, surrounded and unable to escape.
2:14:4/I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn, so he will chase after them. I will be honored through Pharaoh and his entire army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD. And they did exactly that.
2:14:5/Word reached the king of Egypt that the people had escaped. Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people and wondered, "Why did we let Israel go from serving us?"
2:14:6/So he prepared his chariot and took his troops with him.
2:14:7/He took six hundred of his best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, each with its commander.
2:14:8/And the LORD made Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, stubborn, and he pursued the Israelites, who were leaving triumphantly.
2:14:9/The Egyptians—all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, his horsemen, and his army—chased after the Israelites and caught up with them as they camped by the sea near Pihahiroth, opposite Baalzephon.
2:14:10/As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD.
2:14:11/They said to Moses, "Were there no graves in Egypt, so you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done by bringing us out of Egypt?
2:14:12/Didn't we say in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert."
2:14:13/Moses told the people, "Don't be afraid. Stand firm and watch the LORD's salvation that He will show you today. The Egyptians you see today, you will never see again.
2:14:14/The LORD will fight for you; you only need to be still."
2:14:15/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move forward.
2:14:16/But raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to split it. Then the Israelites will go through the sea on dry ground.
2:14:17/And I will make the Egyptians' hearts stubborn so they will follow them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
2:14:18/The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I am honored through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
2:14:19/The angel of God, who had been leading the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,
2:14:20/coming between the camps of the Egyptians and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to one side and light to the other, so neither went near the other all night long.
2:14:21/Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind all night, turning the sea into dry land. The waters were divided.
2:14:22/So the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
2:14:23/The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen followed them into the sea.
2:14:24/In the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud and threw the Egyptian army into confusion.
2:14:25/He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt."
2:14:26/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horsemen."
2:14:27/Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea.
2:14:28/The returning waters covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
2:14:29/But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the middle of the sea, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
2:14:30/So the LORD saved Israel that day from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
2:14:31/And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in Him and in Moses His servant.
2:15:1/Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD, saying, "I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed magnificently: he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea."
2:15:2/The LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation: he is my God, and I will make a home for him; my father's God, and I will praise him highly.
2:15:3/The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
2:15:4/He threw Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea; his elite officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
2:15:5/The depths covered them; they sank to the bottom like a stone.
2:15:6/Your right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power; your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.
2:15:7/In your great majesty, you overthrew those who rose against you. You unleashed your wrath, which consumed them like chaff.
2:15:8/At the blast of your nostrils, the waters piled up, the floods stood firm like a wall, and the depths froze in the heart of the sea.
2:15:9/The enemy boasted, 'I will chase, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils; my desire will be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.'
2:15:10/But you blew with your wind, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
2:15:11/Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?
2:15:12/You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them.
2:15:13/In your mercy, you led the people you redeemed; you guided them in your strength to your holy dwelling.
2:15:14/The peoples will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia.
2:15:15/Then the leaders of Edom will be terrified; the mighty men of Moab will be seized with trembling; all the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away.
2:15:16/Fear and dread will fall on them; by the power of your arm, they will be as still as a stone until your people pass by, O LORD, until the people you bought pass by.
2:15:17/You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance, the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, O LORD, your hands established.
2:15:18/The LORD will reign forever and ever.
2:15:19/For Pharaoh's horse, his chariots, and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them; but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
2:15:20/And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
2:15:21/And Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea."
2:15:22/So Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea, and they went into the desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
2:15:23/When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink its water because it was bitter. That's why the place was named Marah.
2:15:24/And the people complained against Moses, asking, "What are we going to drink?"
2:15:25/So he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There he set for them a decree and a law, and there he tested them,
2:15:26/And said, "If you listen carefully to the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you."
2:15:27/Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.
2:16:1/They set out from Elim, and the entire community of the Israelites arrived at the Wilderness of Sin, located between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt.
2:16:2/The whole community of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
2:16:3/The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt, where we sat around pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you've brought us into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."
2:16:4/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Look, I'm going to make bread rain down from heaven for you. The people will go out and collect a certain amount each day, so I can test them to see if they will follow my instructions or not."
2:16:5/It will happen that on the sixth day when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they collect on the other days.
2:16:6/Moses and Aaron told all the Israelites, "By evening, you will realize that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt."
2:16:7/"And in the morning, you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your complaints against him. Who are we, that you should complain against us?"
2:16:8/Moses also said, "You will know this when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard the complaints you've been making against him. Who are we? Your complaints are not against us but against the LORD."
2:16:9/Moses told Aaron, "Tell the entire Israelite community to come before the LORD, for he has heard your complaints."
2:16:10/As Aaron spoke to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
2:16:11/The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:16:12/"I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them, 'In the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"
2:16:13/That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
2:16:14/When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost appeared on the desert floor.
2:16:15/When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, "What is it?" because they didn't know what it was. Moses told them, "This is the bread the LORD has given you to eat."
2:16:16/"This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Each one of you is to gather as much as they need, an omer per person according to the number of people in each tent.'"
2:16:17/The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered more, some less.
2:16:18/But when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much didn't have too much, and the one who gathered little didn't have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
2:16:19/Moses said, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."
2:16:20/However, some of them didn't listen to Moses and kept part of it until morning, but it was full of worms and began to smell. Moses was angry with them.
2:16:21/They gathered it every morning, each person as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
2:16:22/On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person, and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
2:16:23/He said to them, "This is what the LORD has said: 'Tomorrow is a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"
2:16:24/So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it didn't stink or get worms in it.
2:16:25/Moses said, "Eat it today, because today is a sabbath to the LORD. You will not find it on the ground today.
2:16:26/Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will not be any."
2:16:27/Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.
2:16:28/The LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?
2:16:29/See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are; no one is to go out on the seventh day."
2:16:30/So the people rested on the seventh day.
2:16:31/The Israelites called it manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
2:16:32/Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.'"
2:16:33/Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for your generations."
2:16:34/As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron placed the manna in front of the Testimony, to be kept.
2:16:35/The Israelites ate manna for forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
2:16:36/An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.
2:17:1/All the Israelites traveled from the wilderness of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded, and set up camp in Rephidim. But there was no water for them to drink.
2:17:2/So the people argued with Moses, saying, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why are you arguing with me? Why are you testing the LORD?"
2:17:3/The people were desperately thirsty for water there; they complained to Moses, saying, "Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
2:17:4/In distress, Moses cried out to the LORD, "What should I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."
2:17:5/The LORD instructed Moses, "Walk ahead of the people. Take some of the elders of Israel with you; take the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
2:17:6/Look, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." Moses did this in the presence of the elders of Israel.
2:17:7/He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites argued and tested the LORD, asking, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
2:17:8/Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.
2:17:9/Moses said to Joshua, "Select some men for us, and go out to fight Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
2:17:10/Joshua did as Moses told him and fought against Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill.
2:17:11/Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel was winning, but whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek was winning.
2:17:12/But Moses' arms grew tired; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset.
2:17:13/Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his forces with the sword.
2:17:14/The LORD said to Moses, "Write this as a reminder in a book and recite it to Joshua: I will completely erase the memory of Amalek from under the heavens."
2:17:15/Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner.
2:17:16/He declared, "Because the LORD has sworn: the LORD will be at war with Amalek from generation to generation."
2:18:1/When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about everything God had done for Moses and for Israel, his people, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;
2:18:2/Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,
2:18:3/And her two sons; one was named Gershom, for he said, "I have been a foreigner in a foreign land";
2:18:4/And the other was named Eliezer, for he said, "The God of my father was my helper and saved me from Pharaoh's sword";
2:18:5/And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was camped at the mountain of God;
2:18:6/And he said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you, along with your wife and her two sons."
2:18:7/And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him; they asked each other about their well-being and then went into the tent.
2:18:8/And Moses told his father-in-law everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships they had encountered on the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
2:18:9/And Jethro was delighted about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel, in rescuing them from the Egyptians.
2:18:10/And Jethro said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has rescued you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from the Egyptians' control.
2:18:11/Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, because of the way he dealt with those who were arrogant towards them."
2:18:12/And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.
2:18:13/And the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and they stood around Moses from morning until evening.
2:18:14/When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he asked, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone while everyone stands around you from morning until evening?"
2:18:15/And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will.
2:18:16/When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and laws."
2:18:17/And Moses’ father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.
2:18:18/You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
2:18:19/Listen now to my advice, and God be with you. You should represent the people before God and bring their disputes to Him.
2:18:20/You should teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.
2:18:21/But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
2:18:22/Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every major case to you. The minor cases they can decide themselves. This will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.
2:18:23/If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."
2:18:24/So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
2:18:25/Moses chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
2:18:26/And they judged the people at all times; the difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the minor ones they decided themselves.
2:18:27/And Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went back to his own country.
2:19:1/In the third month after the Israelites had left Egypt, they arrived in the wilderness of Sinai.
2:19:2/They had traveled from Rephidim, reached the desert of Sinai, and set up camp in the wilderness; there, Israel camped near the mountain.
2:19:3/Moses went up to meet with God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and inform the Israelites:
2:19:4/You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
2:19:5/So now, if you listen carefully to my voice and keep my covenant, you will be my treasured possession out of all the nations, for the whole earth is mine.
2:19:6/And you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."
2:19:7/Moses then summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these commands that the LORD had given him.
2:19:8/All the people responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.
2:19:9/The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.
2:19:10/And the LORD told Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
2:19:11/and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
2:19:12/You must set limits for the people all around, saying, 'Be careful not to go up the mountain or touch its edge. Anyone who touches the mountain will surely be put to death.
2:19:13/No hand is to touch it, but they shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; whether animal or person, they will not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they may approach the mountain."
2:19:14/Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
2:19:15/He said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Do not come near your wives."
2:19:16/On the morning of the third day, there were thunders and lightnings, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.
2:19:17/Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
2:19:18/Mount Sinai was covered in smoke because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.
2:19:19/As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with a voice.
2:19:20/The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up.
2:19:21/The LORD warned Moses, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish.
2:19:22/Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."
2:19:23/Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, 'Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.'"
2:19:24/Then the LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them."
2:19:25/So Moses went down to the people and told them.
2:20:1/And God spoke all these words, saying,
2:20:2/I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
2:20:3/You shall have no other gods before me.
2:20:4/You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
2:20:5/You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
2:20:6/But showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
2:20:7/You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
2:20:8/Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
2:20:9/Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
2:20:10/But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns.
2:20:11/For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
2:20:12/Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
2:20:13/You shall not murder.
2:20:14/You shall not commit adultery.
2:20:15/You shall not steal.
2:20:16/You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
2:20:17/You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
2:20:18/And all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain in smoke; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.
2:20:19/And they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die."
2:20:20/And Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning."
2:20:21/And the people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
2:20:22/And the LORD said to Moses, "This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.'"
2:20:23/You must not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.
2:20:24/Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.
2:20:25/If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.
2:20:26/And do not go up to my altar on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.
2:21:1/Here are the laws you must present to them.
2:21:2/If you purchase a Hebrew servant, he is to serve for six years. In the seventh year, he shall be freed without having to pay anything.
2:21:3/If he arrived alone, he shall leave alone. If he was married, then his wife shall leave with him.
2:21:4/If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children belong to her master, and he shall leave by himself.
2:21:5/But if the servant declares, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I do not want to go free,'
2:21:6/then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or doorpost, and pierce his ear with an awl. After that, he will serve his master for life.
2:21:7/If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to be freed in the same way male servants are.
2:21:8/If she does not please her master who has betrothed her to himself, he must allow her to be bought back. He has no right to sell her to foreigners because he has broken faith with her.
2:21:9/If he has selected her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter.
2:21:10/If he marries another woman, he must not reduce her food, clothing, or marital rights.
2:21:11/If he does not provide these three things for her, she is to go free, without any payment of money.
2:21:12/Anyone who strikes a person and causes death must be put to death.
2:21:13/However, if it was not intentional but God allowed it to happen, I will designate a place where the person can flee.
2:21:14/But if someone deliberately attacks and kills another person, you must take them away from my altar and put them to death.
2:21:15/Anyone who attacks their father or mother must be put to death.
2:21:16/Anyone who kidnaps someone, whether they have sold them or still have them, must be put to death.
2:21:17/Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death.
2:21:18/If men argue and one strikes the other with a stone or fist and the injured person does not die but is confined to bed,
2:21:19/if the injured person recovers enough to walk around with a cane, the attacker will not be punished. However, they must compensate the injured person for their lost time and ensure they are fully healed.
2:21:20/If a man strikes his servant or maid with a rod and the servant dies as a direct result, he must be punished.
2:21:21/However, if the servant survives for a day or two, there is no punishment, for the servant is his property.
2:21:22/If men fight and injure a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows.
2:21:23/But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life,
2:21:24/eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
2:21:25/burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
2:21:26/If a man hits the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid and destroys it, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the eye.
2:21:27/And if he knocks out a tooth of his manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the tooth.
2:21:28/If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the ox will not be held responsible.
2:21:29/However, if the ox has had a habit of goring in the past and its owner has been warned but has not kept it confined and it kills a man or woman, the ox must be stoned and its owner also must be put to death.
2:21:30/If a payment is demanded of the owner, then he may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded.
2:21:31/This law also applies if the ox gores a son or daughter.
2:21:32/If the ox gores a servant or maid, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to their master, and the ox must be stoned.
2:21:33/If anyone uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
2:21:34/the owner of the pit must compensate the animal's owner, but the dead animal will belong to him.
2:21:35/If one person's ox injures another's so that it dies, they must sell the live ox and divide the proceeds; they must also divide the dead animal.
2:21:36/But if it is known that the ox has been in the habit of goring and the owner has not kept it confined, the owner must pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his.
2:22:1/If someone steals an ox or a sheep, and either slaughters or sells it, they must compensate with five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
2:22:2/If a thief is caught breaking in and is fatally struck, no one is held responsible for his death.
2:22:3/However, if it happens after sunrise, the person who struck the thief is guilty of bloodshed; the thief must fully compensate. If unable to pay, he must be sold to cover his theft.
2:22:4/If the stolen animal is found alive in the thief's possession, whether it's an ox, donkey, or sheep, he must pay back double.

2:22:7/If someone entrusts their neighbor with money or goods and they are stolen from the neighbor's house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double.
2:22:8/If the thief is not caught, the homeowner must appear before the judges to determine if they have stolen their neighbor's property.
2:22:9/In any case of wrongdoing involving an ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or any lost item claimed by another, both parties must present their case before the judges. Whoever the judges find guilty must pay double to their neighbor.
2:22:10/If someone entrusts a neighbor with an animal and it dies, is injured, or is taken without anyone seeing,
2:22:11/then an oath before the LORD shall be made between them to certify that the keeper has not stolen the property. The owner must accept this, and no restitution is required.
2:22:12/But if the animal was stolen, the keeper must compensate the owner.
2:22:13/If it was killed by a wild animal, the keeper should bring the remains as evidence and will not have to compensate for the loss.
2:22:14/If someone borrows an animal from their neighbor and it gets injured or dies in the absence of the owner, they must make full restitution.
2:22:15/However, if the owner was present, no compensation is required. If the animal was rented, the loss is covered by the rental fee.
2:22:16/If a man seduces a woman who is not engaged and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride price and marry her.
2:22:17/If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must pay an amount equivalent to the bride price for virgins.

2:22:21/You must not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.
2:22:22/You must not cause harm to any widow or orphan.
2:22:23/If you do harm them and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry;
2:22:24/and my anger will flare up, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.
2:22:25/If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not act like a moneylender; charge no interest.
2:22:26/If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset,
2:22:27/because it is their only covering—it is the cloak for their body. What else will they sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.
2:22:28/You must not blaspheme God or curse a leader of your people.
2:22:29/Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or vats. You must give me the firstborn of your sons.
2:22:30/You must do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.
2:22:31/You must be holy to me. Therefore, do not eat any meat that has been torn by wild animals in the field; throw it to the dogs.
2:23:1/Do not spread false reports. Do not join forces with the wicked by being an untruthful witness.
2:23:2/Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd,
2:23:3/Do not show favoritism to a poor person in their lawsuit.
2:23:4/If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to return it.
2:23:5/If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure you help them with it.
2:23:6/Do not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
2:23:7/Stay far away from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty.
2:23:8/Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous.
2:23:9/Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt.
2:23:10/For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops,
2:23:11/But during the seventh year, you must let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat from it, and what they leave the wild animals may eat. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
2:23:12/Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you must rest, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the slave born in your household, and the foreigner, may be refreshed.
2:23:13/Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.
2:23:14/Celebrate three festivals for me each year.
2:23:15/You must observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread; for seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
2:23:16/Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field. Celebrate the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your crops from the field.
2:23:17/Three times a year all the men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord.
2:23:18/Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast. The fat of my festival offerings must not be kept until morning.
2:23:19/Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
2:23:20/See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.
2:23:21/Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him.
2:23:22/If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.
2:23:23/My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
2:23:24/Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.
2:23:25/Worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you,
2:23:26/No one will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span.
2:23:27/I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.
2:23:28/I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites out of your way.
2:23:29/But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.
2:23:30/Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.
2:23:31/I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you.
2:23:32/Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
2:23:33/They must not stay in your land, or they will cause you to sin against me. If you worship their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.
2:24:1/He told Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of Israel's elders; and worship from a distance."
2:24:2/Only Moses is to come near the LORD; the others must not come close, and the people cannot come up with him.
2:24:3/Moses relayed to the people all the LORD's commands and laws. Unanimously, the people said, "We will do everything the LORD has said."
2:24:4/Moses documented all the LORD's commands, got up early in the morning, built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
2:24:5/He sent young Israelite men to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice oxen as fellowship offerings to the LORD.
2:24:6/Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls; the other half he sprinkled on the altar.
2:24:7/He took the covenant book and read it to the people. They responded, "We will do everything the LORD has said and obey."
2:24:8/Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, saying, "This is the blood of the covenant the LORD has made with you based on all these words."
2:24:9/Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up.
2:24:10/They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire, clear as the sky itself.
2:24:11/But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.
2:24:12/The LORD told Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commands I have written for their instruction."
2:24:13/Moses got up, along with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up the mountain of God.
2:24:14/He told the elders, "Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are with you; anyone with a dispute can go to them."
2:24:15/Moses went up the mountain, and the cloud covered it.
2:24:16/The LORD's glory settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day, he called to Moses from within the cloud.
2:24:17/The appearance of the LORD's glory to the Israelites was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop.
2:24:18/Moses entered the cloud as he went up the mountain. He stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.
2:25:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:25:2/Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to accept the offering from anyone who gives it willingly from their heart.
2:25:3/This offering should include gold, silver, and bronze,
2:25:4/As well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine linen, and goats' hair,
2:25:5/Also, rams' skins dyed red, another type of durable leather, and acacia wood,
2:25:6/Oil for the lamp, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
2:25:7/Onyx stones, and other gemstones for setting in the ephod and the breastplate.
2:25:8/Have them make a sanctuary for me, so I can live among them.
2:25:9/Make sure you construct it exactly according to the design I show you—the design of the tabernacle and all its furnishings.
2:25:10/They are to make an ark of acacia wood—its length should be two and a half cubits, its width a cubit and a half, and its height a cubit and a half.
2:25:11/Cover it inside and out with pure gold, and put a gold molding around it.
2:25:12/Cast four gold rings for it and attach them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
2:25:13/Make poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold.
2:25:14/Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
2:25:15/The poles are to remain in the rings of the ark; they should not be removed.
2:25:16/Place in the ark the tablets of the covenant law, which I will give you.
2:25:17/Make a cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
2:25:18/Make two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
2:25:19/Make one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; make the cherubim of one piece with the cover, at the two ends.
2:25:20/The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the cover.
2:25:21/Place the cover on top of the ark and put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law that I will give you.
2:25:22/There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.
2:25:23/Make a table of acacia wood—two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2:25:24/Cover it with pure gold and put a gold molding around it.
2:25:25/Also make around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
2:25:26/Make four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners, where the four legs are.
2:25:27/The rings are to be close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.
2:25:28/Make the poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold and use them to carry the table.
2:25:29/Make its plates and dishes of pure gold, as well as its pitchers and bowls for the pouring out of offerings.
2:25:30/Place the Bread of the Presence on this table to be before me at all times.
2:25:31/Make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand should be made of hammered work: its base, its stem, its cups, its buds, and its flowers should be of one piece with it.
2:25:32/Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
2:25:33/Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and petals are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
2:25:34/And on the lampstand itself are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and petals.
2:25:35/Include a bud under each pair of branches that extend from the lampstand, for a total of six branches.
2:25:36/The buds and branches shall all be of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
2:25:37/Then make its seven lamps and set them up on it so that they light the space in front of it.
2:25:38/Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of pure gold.
2:25:39/A talent of pure gold is to be used for the lampstand and all these accessories.
2:25:40/See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
2:26:1/You shall also construct the tabernacle using ten curtains of fine linen, intricately woven with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and decorated with cherubim.
2:26:2/Each curtain will be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide, with all the curtains having the same dimensions.
2:26:3/Five of the curtains will be joined together, and the other five curtains will also be joined together.
2:26:4/Make loops of blue yarn along the edge of one curtain at the end in the set, and do the same on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.
2:26:5/Create fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the edge of the last curtain in the second set, so the loops can be fastened together.
2:26:6/Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to join the curtains together, so it becomes a single tabernacle.
2:26:7/Make additional curtains of goat hair to serve as a covering over the tabernacle; you will need eleven curtains.
2:26:8/Each of these curtains will be thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, with all eleven curtains being the same size.
2:26:9/Join five of the curtains by themselves and the other six by themselves, and fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tabernacle.
2:26:10/Make fifty loops on the edge of the last curtain in one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain in the second set.
2:26:11/Then make fifty bronze clasps and insert them into the loops to join the tent together as one unit.
2:26:12/The remaining part of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that is left over, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.
2:26:13/And the extra length on one side and on the other side, from the length of the curtains, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it.
2:26:14/You shall also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and another covering on top made of fine leather.
2:26:15/Construct frames for the tabernacle using acacia wood, standing upright.
2:26:16/Each frame will be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
2:26:17/Each frame will have two pegs aligned with each other; you shall do this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
2:26:18/Make the frames for the tabernacle, twenty frames for the south side.
2:26:19/And make forty silver bases under the twenty frames; two bases under each frame for its two pegs.
2:26:20/For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, there will also be twenty frames.
2:26:21/And their forty silver bases; two bases under each frame.
2:26:22/For the west side of the tabernacle, make six frames.
2:26:23/Make two additional frames for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
2:26:24/These will be connected at the bottom and also joined together at the top with a single ring; this is how it will be for both of the corner frames.
2:26:25/So there will be eight frames with their sixteen silver bases, two bases under each frame.
2:26:26/Make crossbars of acacia wood; five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
2:26:27/Five bars for the frames on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames on the west side of the tabernacle.
2:26:28/The middle bar in the center of the frames will extend from end to end.
2:26:29/Overlay the frames with gold and make their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlay the bars with gold as well.
2:26:30/Raise up the tabernacle according to the design you were shown on the mountain.
2:26:31/Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen, artistically worked with cherubim.
2:26:32/Hang it on four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold, with hooks of gold, standing on four silver bases.
2:26:33/Hang the veil below the clasps and bring the Ark of the Covenant inside the veil, so the veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.
2:26:34/Place the atonement cover on the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place.
2:26:35/Set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand across from the table on the south side of the tabernacle; place the table on the north side.
2:26:36/Make a curtain for the entrance of the tent, using blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, decorated with embroidery.
2:26:37/For the curtain, make five pillars of acacia wood, overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold; and cast five bronze bases for them.
2:27:1/You shall construct an altar of acacia wood, five cubits in length and five cubits in width; the altar shall be square, and its height shall be three cubits.
2:27:2/You shall make horns for it on its four corners; the horns shall be of the same material, and you shall cover it with bronze.
2:27:3/You shall make its pans to catch its ashes, along with its shovels, basins, meat hooks, and firepans: all its utensils you shall make of bronze.
2:27:4/You shall make for it a grate of bronze mesh, and on the mesh you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners.
2:27:5/You shall place it under the ledge of the altar below, so that the net extends halfway up the altar.
2:27:6/You shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and cover them with bronze.
2:27:7/The poles shall be inserted into the rings, so that the poles are on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.
2:27:8/You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown to you on the mountain, so shall it be made.
2:27:9/You shall construct the courtyard of the tabernacle: for the south side, facing south, there shall be curtains for the courtyard made of finely twisted linen, one hundred cubits long for one side.
2:27:10/And its twenty pillars and their twenty bases shall be of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be of silver.
2:27:11/And similarly for the north side in length, there shall be curtains one hundred cubits long, and its twenty pillars and their twenty bases of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver.
2:27:12/And for the width of the courtyard on the west side, there shall be curtains of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their bases ten.
2:27:13/And the width of the courtyard on the east side, facing east, shall be fifty cubits.
2:27:14/The curtains for one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their bases three.
2:27:15/And on the other side, curtains fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their bases three.
2:27:16/And for the gate of the courtyard, there shall be a curtain twenty cubits long, made of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, crafted with embroidery; its pillars shall be four, and their bases four.
2:27:17/All the pillars around the courtyard shall be banded with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their bases of bronze.
2:27:18/The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits, and the width fifty cubits everywhere, and the height five cubits, made of finely twisted linen, and their bases of bronze.
2:27:19/All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, and all its tent pegs, and all the pegs of the courtyard, shall be of bronze.
2:27:20/You shall instruct the Israelites to bring you clear olive oil, beaten for the light, so that the lamp may always burn.
2:27:21/In the Tent of Meeting, outside the curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening until morning before the LORD. It shall be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come from the Israelites.
2:28:1/Select Aaron your brother and his sons from among the Israelites to serve me as priests—Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.
2:28:2/Create sacred garments for Aaron your brother to honor and beautify him.
2:28:3/Talk to all the skilled artisans I have endowed with wisdom, so they can make Aaron's garments to set him apart, allowing him to serve me as a priest.
2:28:4/These are the garments they are to make: a breastplate, an ephod, a robe, an embroidered tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these sacred garments for your brother Aaron and his sons so they can serve me as priests.
2:28:5/They must use gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
2:28:6/They are to craft the ephod with gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, skillfully worked.
2:28:7/It will have two shoulder pieces attached to its two edges, so it can be fastened.
2:28:8/The artistically woven waistband on the ephod must be made of the same materials—gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:28:9/You are to take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the Israelites.
2:28:10/Engrave six of their names on one stone and the remaining six on the other, in the order of their birth.
2:28:11/With the skill of a gem cutter, engrave the two stones with the names of the Israelites. Set them in gold filigree settings.
2:28:12/Attach the stones to the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the Israelites. Aaron will carry their names on his shoulders before the LORD as a reminder.
2:28:13/Make settings of gold.
2:28:14/Create two gold chains with twisted work, and attach the twisted chains to the settings.
2:28:15/Fashion the breastpiece of decision with skilled craftsmanship, like the work of the ephod; use gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:28:16/It should be square and folded double, a span in length and width.
2:28:17/Set it with four rows of gemstones. The first row will have a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl.
2:28:18/The second row will have a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald.
2:28:19/The third row will have a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.
2:28:20/The fourth row will have a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They are to be mounted in gold filigree settings.
2:28:21/The stones are to correspond to the names of the Israelites, twelve according to their names. They are to be like the engravings of a seal, each with its name for the twelve tribes.
2:28:22/Make chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, for the breastpiece.
2:28:23/Make two gold rings for the breastpiece and attach them to its two corners.
2:28:24/Then attach the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece.
2:28:25/Attach the other ends of the two chains to the two settings, connecting them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
2:28:26/Make two gold rings and attach them to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod.
2:28:27/Make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
2:28:28/The rings of the breastpiece are to be tied to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece will not swing out from the ephod.
2:28:29/Aaron will carry the names of the Israelites in the breastpiece of decision over his heart when he enters the Holy Place, as a continual memorial before the LORD.
2:28:30/Into the breastpiece of decision you are to place the Urim and Thummim, so they will be over Aaron's heart when he goes before the LORD. Thus, Aaron will always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the LORD.
2:28:31/Make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth.
2:28:32/It should have an opening for the head in its center. There must be a woven edge around this opening, like the collar of a body armor, so it will not tear.
2:28:33/Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn around the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them.
2:28:34/The gold bells and pomegranates are to alternate around the hem of the robe.
2:28:35/Aaron must wear it when he ministers. The sound of the bells will be heard when he enters and leaves the Holy Place before the LORD, so he will not die.
2:28:36/Make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.
2:28:37/Fasten it on a blue cord to attach it to the turban; it is to be on the front of the turban.
2:28:38/It will be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron will bear the guilt involved in the sacred gifts the Israelites consecrate, whatever their gifts may be. It will be always on his forehead, so that they will be accepted before the LORD.
2:28:39/Weave the tunic of fine linen, make the turban of fine linen, and also make the sash using embroidered work.
2:28:40/For Aaron's sons, make tunics, sashes, and headgear for dignity and adornment.
2:28:41/Dress your brother Aaron and his sons with these garments. Anoint them, ordain them, and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.
2:28:42/Make linen undergarments to cover their nakedness, reaching from the waist to the thighs.
2:28:43/Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so they will not incur guilt and die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.
2:29:1/Here's what you need to do to make them holy, so they can serve me as priests: Take one young bull and two rams without any defects.
2:29:2/Also take unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, all made from fine wheat flour.
2:29:3/Put them all in one basket and bring them, along with the bull and the two rams.
2:29:4/Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the meeting tent and wash them with water.
2:29:5/Then, dress Aaron in the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, the breastplate, and tie the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him.
2:29:6/Place the turban on his head and attach the sacred emblem to the turban.
2:29:7/Next, take the anointing oil, pour it on his head, and anoint him.
2:29:8/Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
2:29:9/Tie sashes around Aaron and his sons, put headbands on them, and the priesthood will be their responsibility as a lasting ordinance. This is how you will ordain Aaron and his sons.
2:29:10/Bring the bull to the front of the meeting tent, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2:29:11/Then, slaughter the bull in the presence of the LORD at the entrance to the meeting tent.
2:29:12/Take some of the bull's blood and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
2:29:13/Take all the fat that covers the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.
2:29:14/But burn the bull's flesh, its skin, and its dung outside the camp. It is a sin offering.
2:29:15/Also take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2:29:16/Then, slaughter the ram, take its blood and sprinkle it around the altar.
2:29:17/Cut the ram into pieces, wash the internal organs and the legs, and place them with the head and the other pieces.
2:29:18/Burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2:29:19/Now take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2:29:20/Then, slaughter the ram, take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Sprinkle the blood around the altar.
2:29:21/Take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. Then he and his garments will be holy, as well as his sons and their garments.
2:29:22/Also take the fat from the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh (since it is a ram of ordination),
2:29:23/along with one loaf of bread, one cake made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD.
2:29:24/Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
2:29:25/Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before the LORD. It is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2:29:26/Take the breast of the ram of Aaron's ordination and wave it as a wave offering before the LORD. It will be your portion.
2:29:27/Consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution, which were waved and raised up, from the ram of ordination, from what was for Aaron and for his sons.
2:29:28/This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants from the Israelites, for it is a contribution. It will be a contribution from the Israelites from their fellowship offerings, their contribution to the LORD.
2:29:29/The sacred garments of Aaron will be passed down to his sons after him, to be anointed and ordained in them.
2:29:30/The son who succeeds him as priest and enters the tent of meeting to serve in the Holy Place must wear them for seven days.
2:29:31/Take the ram of ordination and cook its meat in a sacred place.
2:29:32/Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread in the basket at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
2:29:33/They are to eat these offerings with which atonement was made to ordain and consecrate them, but no one else may eat them because they are sacred.
2:29:34/If any of the meat of the ordination or any of the bread remains until morning, burn the leftovers. They must not be eaten because they are sacred.
2:29:35/Do this for Aaron and his sons, exactly as I have commanded you. The ordination will last seven days.
2:29:36/Each day offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement. Cleanse the altar by making atonement for it, and then anoint it to consecrate it.
2:29:37/For seven days make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will be holy.
2:29:38/This is what you are to offer on the altar: two one-year-old lambs each day, continuously.
2:29:39/Offer one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at twilight.
2:29:40/With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of pressed olive oil, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
2:29:41/Offer the second lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2:29:42/This will be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet you to speak to you there.
2:29:43/There I will meet with the Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory.
2:29:44/I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests.
2:29:45/I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
2:29:46/And they will know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.
2:30:1/You must build an altar for burning incense, using acacia wood to construct it.
2:30:2/It should be one cubit long and one cubit wide, forming a square, and two cubits high with horns of the same material.
2:30:3/Cover it with pure gold, including the top, sides, and horns, and craft a gold crown around it.
2:30:4/Make two gold rings for it below the crown on opposite sides, for holding the poles used to carry it.
2:30:5/The poles themselves should be made of acacia wood and covered with gold.
2:30:6/Place it in front of the curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant, in front of the atonement cover on the Ark where I will meet with you.
2:30:7/Aaron must burn fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps.
2:30:8/He must also burn incense in the evening when he lights the lamps, so incense will burn regularly before the LORD for generations to come.
2:30:9/Do not offer any unauthorized incense on it, or any burnt offering, grain offering, or drink offering.
2:30:10/Once a year Aaron must make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the sin offering of atonement for generations to come. It is most holy to the LORD.
2:30:11/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:30:12/When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the LORD a ransom for himself to avoid a plague when you count them.
2:30:13/Everyone included in the census must pay half a shekel, based on the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs). This half shekel is an offering to the LORD.
2:30:14/Everyone counted, from twenty years old and up, must give this offering to the LORD.
2:30:15/The wealthy must not give more, and the poor must not give less than half a shekel when you give the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives.
2:30:16/You must take the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a reminder to the Israelites before the LORD, making atonement for your lives.
2:30:17/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:30:18/You must also make a bronze basin with its bronze stand for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
2:30:19/Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet with water from it.
2:30:20/Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting, they must wash with water so they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the LORD,
2:30:21/they must wash their hands and feet so they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for generations to come.
2:30:22/Moreover, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:30:23/Take the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much (250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant calamus,
2:30:24/500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil.
2:30:25/Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil.
2:30:26/Then use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Covenant law,
2:30:27/the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,
2:30:28/the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
2:30:29/You must consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy.
2:30:30/Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.
2:30:31/Tell the Israelites, 'This will be my sacred anointing oil for generations to come.
2:30:32/Do not pour it on anyone else's body, and do not make any oil with the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred.
2:30:33/Anyone who makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.'
2:30:34/And the LORD said to Moses, "Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha, and galbanum—along with pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,
2:30:35/and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It must be salted and pure and sacred.
2:30:36/Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the Ark of the Covenant law in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.
2:30:37/Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the LORD.
2:30:38/Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.
2:31:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:31:2/Look, I have specifically chosen Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah:
2:31:3/And I have filled him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and exceptional skills in all kinds of craftsmanship,
2:31:4/To create intricate designs, to work with gold, silver, and bronze,
2:31:5/And in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.
2:31:6/And I have also provided Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to work with him. And in the hearts of all who are skilled, I have placed wisdom so they can make everything I have instructed you;
2:31:7/The meeting tent, the ark of the covenant, the atonement cover on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
2:31:8/The table and its furnishings, the pure gold lampstand with all its accessories, and the altar of incense,
2:31:9/The altar of burnt offering with all its furnishings, the basin and its stand,
2:31:10/The woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to serve as priests,
2:31:11/The anointing oil, and fragrant incense for the sanctuary. They are to do everything just as I have commanded you.
2:31:12/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:31:13/Tell the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.
2:31:14/Therefore, you must keep the Sabbath because it is sacred for you. Anyone who desecrates it must surely be put to death; anyone who does any work on that day must be cut off from their people.
2:31:15/Six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, sacred to the LORD. Anyone who does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death.
2:31:16/So the Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
2:31:17/It will be a sign forever between me and the Israelites, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.
2:31:18/And when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
2:32:1/When the people saw that Moses was taking a long time to come down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Get up, make us gods who will lead us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."
2:32:2/Aaron told them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, sons, and daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."
2:32:3/So all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.
2:32:4/He took the gold from them, shaped it with a tool, and made a golden calf. Then they said, "These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."
2:32:5/When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD."
2:32:6/They got up early the next day, offered burnt offerings, and presented peace offerings. The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to indulge in revelry.
2:32:7/The LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have become corrupt."
2:32:8/They have quickly turned away from what I commanded them and have made themselves a golden calf. They have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, 'These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'"
2:32:9/The LORD said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people."
2:32:10/Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."
2:32:11/But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God and said, "LORD, why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?"
2:32:12/Why should the Egyptians say, 'He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people."
2:32:13/Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"
2:32:14/Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
2:32:15/Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
2:32:16/The tablets were the work of God; the writing was God's writing, engraved on the tablets.
2:32:17/When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."
2:32:18/Moses replied, "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."
2:32:19/As soon as Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.
2:32:20/He took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.
2:32:21/Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"
2:32:22/Aaron said, "Do not let your anger burn; you know the people are prone to evil."
2:32:23/They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'"
2:32:24/So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"
2:32:25/When Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies,
2:32:26/he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.
2:32:27/Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"
2:32:28/The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.
2:32:29/Moses said, "Today you have been ordained for the service of the LORD, each man at the cost of his son and brother, so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day."
2:32:30/The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
2:32:31/Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, these people have committed a great sin by making themselves gods of gold."
2:32:32/Yet now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of the book you have written."
2:32:33/The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book."
2:32:34/Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."
2:32:35/And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
2:33:1/The LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place and go up with the people you brought out of Egypt to the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.'
2:33:2/I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2:33:3/To a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not travel among you, for you are stubborn, and I might destroy you on the way."
2:33:4/When the people heard this distressing news, they mourned and no one put on their jewelry.
2:33:5/For the LORD had told Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stubborn people. If I were to come among you for even a moment, I might destroy you. So now, take off your jewelry so I can decide what to do with you.'"
2:33:6/So the Israelites took off their jewelry at Mount Horeb.
2:33:7/Moses took the tent and set it up outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tent of Meeting. Anyone seeking the LORD would go out to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp.
2:33:8/Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.
2:33:9/As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
2:33:10/All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tent entrance, and each one worshipped at the entrance of their tent.
2:33:11/The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua, son of Nun, did not leave the tent.
2:33:12/Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.'
2:33:13/Now if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember this nation is your people."
2:33:14/And He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
2:33:15/Then Moses said to Him, "If your presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.
2:33:16/How will it be known that I and your people have found favor in your sight unless you go with us? Your going with us will distinguish us, me and your people, from all the other people on the face of the earth."
2:33:17/And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name."
2:33:18/Then Moses said, "Please show me your glory."
2:33:19/And He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
2:33:20/But," He said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."
2:33:21/And the LORD said, "Here is a place near me where you shall stand on a rock.
2:33:22/When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
2:33:23/Then I will remove my hand, and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."
2:34:1/And the LORD said to Moses, "Carve two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke."
2:34:2/"Be ready by morning, and in the morning come up to Mount Sinai and present yourself to me at the top of the mountain."
2:34:3/"No one is to come up with you, nor should anyone be seen anywhere on the mountain; nor let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain."
2:34:4/So he carved two stone tablets like the first ones; and Moses got up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai as the LORD had instructed him, carrying the two stone tablets in his hand.
2:34:5/And the LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and declared the name of the LORD.
2:34:6/And the LORD passed in front of him and declared, "The LORD, The LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and overflowing with kindness and truth,
2:34:7/Maintaining love for thousands, forgiving wrongdoing, rebellion, and sin, yet He will not leave the guilty unpunished; bringing the consequences of the fathers' sins upon their children and their children's children, to the third and fourth generation."
2:34:8/And Moses quickly bowed his head to the ground and worshiped.
2:34:9/And he said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, O LORD, I pray, let the LORD go among us, even though we are a stubborn people; and forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."
2:34:10/And He said, "Look, I am making a covenant: before all your people I will perform wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome the work of the LORD is, the awesome deeds I will do with you."
2:34:11/"Pay attention to what I command you today: I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
2:34:12/"Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, or it will be a snare among you."
2:34:13/"But you shall demolish their altars, smash their sacred stones, and cut down their Asherah poles."
2:34:14/"For you must not worship any other god, because the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God."
2:34:15/"Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices."
2:34:16/"And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same."
2:34:17/"Do not make any idols for yourselves."
2:34:18/"You must keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of Egypt."
2:34:19/"Everything that first opens the womb is mine, and all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep."
2:34:20/"But the firstborn of a donkey you must redeem with a lamb; if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before me empty-handed."
2:34:21/"Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you must rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest."
2:34:22/"And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year."
2:34:23/"Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel."
2:34:24/"For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God."
2:34:25/"Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning."
2:34:26/"Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
2:34:27/And the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
2:34:28/And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
2:34:29/When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD.
2:34:30/When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.
2:34:31/But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and Moses spoke to them.
2:34:32/Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai.
2:34:33/Until Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
2:34:34/But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
2:34:35/the Israelites would see Moses’ face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.
2:35:1/Moses gathered all the Israelites and said, "These are the commands the LORD has given for you to follow."
2:35:2/You can work for six days, but the seventh day is a sacred day of rest dedicated to the LORD. Anyone who works on this day must be put to death.
2:35:3/Do not light any fires in your homes on the Sabbath day.
2:35:4/Moses told the Israelites, "This is what the LORD has commanded:"
2:35:5/"Everyone who is willing should bring an offering to the LORD. You can bring gold, silver, and bronze,
2:35:6/as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine linen, and goats' hair,
2:35:7/ram skins dyed red, another type of durable leather, and acacia wood,
2:35:8/olive oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
2:35:9/onyx stones, and other gems for setting in the ephod and the breastplate.
2:35:10/Anyone skilled can come and make everything the LORD has commanded:
2:35:11/the tabernacle, its tent and cover, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases,
2:35:12/the ark with its poles, the atonement cover, and the curtain that shields it,
2:35:13/the table with its poles and all its articles, and the bread of the Presence,
2:35:14/the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps, and oil for the light,
2:35:15/the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle,
2:35:16/the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin with its stand,
2:35:17/the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard,
2:35:18/the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes,
2:35:19/the woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests."
2:35:20/Then all the Israelites left Moses' presence.
2:35:21/Everyone whose heart was moved and whose spirit prompted them brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.
2:35:22/Both men and women came, all who were willing, and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings, and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.
2:35:23/Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, fine linen, goats' hair, ram skins dyed red or another type of durable leather brought them.
2:35:24/Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
2:35:25/Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—blue, purple, or scarlet yarn or fine linen.
2:35:26/And all the women whose hearts stirred them to use their skill spun the goats' hair.
2:35:27/The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be set in the ephod and the breastplate.
2:35:28/They also brought spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
2:35:29/The Israelites brought a freewill offering to the LORD, every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring material for all kinds of work, which the LORD, through Moses, had commanded to be done.
2:35:30/Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
2:35:31/He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge, and with all kinds of skills—
2:35:32/to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze,
2:35:33/to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts.
2:35:34/And He has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.
2:35:35/He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.
2:36:1/Then Bezaleel, Aholiab, and every skilled craftsman, whom the LORD endowed with wisdom and understanding, set to work on all kinds of tasks for the sanctuary service, just as the LORD had instructed.
2:36:2/And Moses summoned Bezaleel, Aholiab, and every skilled craftsman in whose heart the LORD had placed wisdom, everyone who felt compelled to come and do the work.
2:36:3/They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought for the sanctuary's service. They continued to bring him voluntary offerings every morning.
2:36:4/All the skilled workers who were doing the sanctuary work left their work to come,
2:36:5/And they told Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough for completing the work the LORD commanded us to do."
2:36:6/So Moses issued an order, which was announced throughout the camp: "No man or woman should make anything more as an offering for the sanctuary." Thus, the people were stopped from bringing more.
2:36:7/Because what they already had was more than enough to complete all the work.
2:36:8/Every skilled craftsman among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains of finely twisted linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim skillfully worked into them.
2:36:9/Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide, all the curtains were the same size.
2:36:10/He joined five of the curtains together, and did the same with the other five.
2:36:11/He made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and did the same on the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
2:36:12/He made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain in the other set, with the loops opposite each other.
2:36:13/Then he made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the curtains to each other, so that the tabernacle was a unified whole.
2:36:14/He made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven of these.
2:36:15/Each curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, all eleven curtains were the same size.
2:36:16/He joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.
2:36:17/He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
2:36:18/He made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together into a single unit.
2:36:19/He made a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and another covering of fine leather on top of that.
2:36:20/He made upright frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood.
2:36:21/Each frame was ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
2:36:22/Each frame had two projections, set parallel to each other; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
2:36:23/He made frames for the tabernacle: twenty frames for the south side,
2:36:24/And he made forty silver bases under the twenty frames; two bases under each frame for its two projections.
2:36:25/For the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames,
2:36:26/And their forty silver bases; two bases under each frame.
2:36:27/For the west end of the tabernacle, he made six frames.
2:36:28/He made two frames for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
2:36:29/They were coupled at the bottom and joined together at the top by a single ring; he did this for both of them at the two corners.
2:36:30/So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases; two bases under each frame.
2:36:31/He made crossbars of acacia wood; five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
2:36:32/Five bars for the frames on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames on the west end of the tabernacle.
2:36:33/He made the center bar to run through the frames from one end to the other.
2:36:34/He overlaid the frames with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
2:36:35/He made a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
2:36:36/He made four pillars of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four silver bases for them.
2:36:37/He made a curtain for the entrance of the tent, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, embroidered with needlework,
2:36:38/And five pillars for it with hooks. He overlaid their capitals and bands with gold, but their five bases were made of bronze.
2:37:1/Bezaleel constructed the ark from acacia wood: it was two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2:37:2/He covered it inside and out with pure gold and crafted a gold crown around it.
2:37:3/He created four gold rings for it, placing them at its four corners; two rings on one side and two on the other.
2:37:4/He made poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold.
2:37:5/He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
2:37:6/He crafted the mercy seat from pure gold: it was two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
2:37:7/He formed two cherubim from gold, hammering them out from a single piece at the two ends of the mercy seat.
2:37:8/One cherub was placed at one end and the other cherub at the opposite end; he made the cherubim at the two ends as part of the mercy seat.
2:37:9/The cherubim spread their wings upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, facing each other with their faces toward the mercy seat.
2:37:10/He constructed the table from acacia wood: it was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2:37:11/He covered it with pure gold and added a gold crown around it.
2:37:12/He also added a border a handbreadth wide around it and placed a gold crown around the border.
2:37:13/He cast four gold rings for it and attached the rings to its four legs.
2:37:14/The rings were placed close to the border as holders for the poles to carry the table.
2:37:15/He made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold to carry the table.
2:37:16/He crafted the vessels that were to be placed on the table—his dishes, spoons, bowls, and covers—all out of pure gold.
2:37:17/He made the lampstand from pure gold, hammering out its base, shaft, branches, bowls, buds, and flowers as one piece.
2:37:18/Six branches extended from its sides; three branches from one side and three from the other.
2:37:19/Each branch had three almond-shaped bowls, each with a bud and a flower, matching the pattern across all six branches extending from the lampstand.
2:37:20/The lampstand itself had four almond-shaped bowls, complete with buds and flowers.
2:37:21/There was a bud under each pair of branches, consistent for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
2:37:22/The buds and branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, all hammered from pure gold.
2:37:23/He crafted its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, out of pure gold.
2:37:24/He used a talent of pure gold for the lampstand and all its accessories.
2:37:25/He constructed the altar of incense from acacia wood; it was a cubit long, a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high, with horns of the same piece.
2:37:26/He covered it with pure gold, its top, sides all around, and its horns, and made a gold crown around it.
2:37:27/He made two gold rings for it below its crown on two opposite sides as holders for the poles to carry it.
2:37:28/He made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold.
2:37:29/He prepared the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, following the recipe of a perfumer.
2:38:1/He constructed the altar of burnt offering from acacia wood: it was five cubits long and five cubits wide, forming a square, and it stood three cubits high.
2:38:2/He added horns at each of the four corners, made from the same material, and covered the whole thing in bronze.
2:38:3/He crafted all the altar's equipment, including pots, shovels, basins, meat hooks, and firepans, all out of bronze.
2:38:4/For the altar, he made a bronze grate as a network underneath, extending halfway up.
2:38:5/He cast four rings at the four corners of the bronze grate to hold the poles.
2:38:6/The poles were made of acacia wood and covered in bronze.
2:38:7/He inserted the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it; the altar was hollow, made with boards.
2:38:8/He constructed the basin and its stand from bronze, using the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
2:38:9/He built the courtyard: on the south side, the curtains were made of finely twisted linen, 100 cubits long.
2:38:10/There were twenty pillars with twenty bronze bases; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were made of silver.
2:38:11/On the north side, the curtains were 100 cubits long, with twenty pillars and twenty bronze bases; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver.
2:38:12/On the west side, the curtains were fifty cubits long, with ten pillars and ten bases; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver.
2:38:13/And for the east side, the curtains were fifty cubits long.
2:38:14/The curtains for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.
2:38:15/On the other side, the curtains were also fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.
2:38:16/All the curtains surrounding the courtyard were made of finely twisted linen.
2:38:17/The bases for the pillars were bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver; the tops of the pillars were covered with silver; and all the pillars of the courtyard were banded with silver.
2:38:18/The curtain for the courtyard gate was made of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, crafted in embroidery. It was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, matching the curtains of the courtyard.
2:38:19/Its four pillars had four bronze bases; their hooks were silver, and the tops of the pillars and their bands were covered with silver.
2:38:20/All the pegs for the tabernacle and for the surrounding courtyard were made of bronze.
2:38:21/This is the inventory of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, as recorded at Moses' command. It was the responsibility of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
2:38:22/Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the LORD commanded Moses.
2:38:23/And with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, a skilled craftsman, and a weaver in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.
2:38:24/The total amount of gold used for the work in all the holy place was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
2:38:25/The silver from those of the community who were counted was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, by the sanctuary shekel.
2:38:26/A beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had passed through the counting, from twenty years old and up, totaling six hundred three thousand five hundred and fifty men.
2:38:27/From the hundred talents of silver, the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain were cast—hundred bases from the hundred talents, a talent for each base.
2:38:28/And from the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, he made hooks for the pillars, covered their tops, and banded them.
2:38:29/The bronze from the offering was seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels.
2:38:30/With it, he made the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grate for it, and all the utensils for the altar,
2:38:31/As well as the bases around the courtyard, the bases for the courtyard gate, and all the pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard surrounding it.
2:39:1/They crafted cloths of service from blue, purple, and scarlet materials, creating the sacred garments for Aaron to serve in the holy place, following the LORD's instructions to Moses.
2:39:2/He crafted the ephod using gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and finely twisted linen.
2:39:3/They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into wires to incorporate it into the blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen with skilled craftsmanship.
2:39:4/They made shoulder pieces for it, connecting them together at the two edges.
2:39:5/The intricately designed belt of the ephod, which was part of it, was made from the same materials: gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and finely twisted linen, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:39:6/They crafted onyx stones set in gold settings, engraved like seals with the names of the sons of Israel.
2:39:7/He placed them on the ephod's shoulders as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:39:8/He created the breastplate with skilled craftsmanship, matching the ephod's design, using gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and finely twisted linen.
2:39:9/It was square and folded double; a span in length and a span in width when doubled.
2:39:10/They set four rows of stones in it: the first row had a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl; this was the first row.
2:39:11/The second row had an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
2:39:12/The third row had a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.
2:39:13/The fourth row had a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper; they were set in gold filigree settings.
2:39:14/The stones corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names, engraved like seals, each with its name, for the twelve tribes.
2:39:15/They made chains for the breastplate, twisted like cords, out of pure gold.
2:39:16/They crafted two gold settings and two gold rings, attaching the rings to the two ends of the breastplate.
2:39:17/They attached the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastplate.
2:39:18/They fastened the other ends of the two chains to the two settings, attaching them to the ephod's shoulder pieces at the front.
2:39:19/They made two gold rings and attached them to the two ends of the breastplate, on its inner edge, next to the ephod.
2:39:20/They made two more gold rings and attached them to the ephod's lower part, near the seam above the ephod's intricately woven belt.
2:39:21/They tied the breastplate to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so it would lie above the ephod's intricately woven belt and not swing out from the ephod, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2:39:22/He made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue woven fabric.
2:39:23/There was an opening in the center of the robe, like the neck of a body armor, with a band around the opening so it wouldn't tear.
2:39:24/They added pomegranates made of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.
2:39:25/They made bells of pure gold and placed the bells between the pomegranates around the hem of the robe, all around between the pomegranates;
2:39:26/A bell and a pomegranate alternated around the hem of the robe for ministering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2:39:27/They made tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons,
2:39:28/And a turban of fine linen, elegant headbands of fine linen, and undergarments of finely twisted linen,
2:39:29/And a sash of finely twisted linen, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, done in embroidery, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2:39:30/They made the plate of the sacred diadem of pure gold and inscribed it with the inscription, "Holy to the LORD."
2:39:31/They attached a blue cord to it to fasten it on the turban, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2:39:32/So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2:39:33/They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;
2:39:34/The coverings of ram skins dyed red, the coverings of another material, and the protective curtain,
2:39:35/The ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover,
2:39:36/The table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence,
2:39:37/The pure gold lampstand with its array of lamps and all its accessories, and the oil for lighting,
2:39:38/The gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent,
2:39:39/The bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin with its stand,
2:39:40/The curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard, its ropes, and tent pegs, and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting,
2:39:41/The woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests.
2:39:42/In accordance with all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the Israelites had done all the work.
2:39:43/When Moses saw that they had done all the work exactly as the LORD had commanded, he blessed them.
2:40:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:40:2/On the first day of the first month, you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
2:40:3/You shall place the ark of the covenant inside, and cover the ark with the curtain.
2:40:4/You shall bring in the table and arrange the items that are to be placed on it; you shall also bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.
2:40:5/You shall place the gold altar for incense before the ark of the covenant, and set up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
2:40:6/You shall place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
2:40:7/You shall place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and fill it with water.
2:40:8/You shall set up the courtyard around it, and hang the curtain at the courtyard entrance.
2:40:9/You shall take the anointing oil, anoint the tabernacle and everything in it, and consecrate it and all its furnishings; it will be holy.
2:40:10/You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar; it will be most holy.
2:40:11/You shall anoint the basin and its stand, and consecrate them.
2:40:12/You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
2:40:13/You shall put the sacred garments on Aaron, anoint him, and consecrate him, so he may serve me as a priest.
2:40:14/You shall bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
2:40:15/You shall anoint them as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests; their anointing will indeed establish a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.
2:40:16/Thus Moses did everything as the LORD commanded him, so he did.
2:40:17/And it happened in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was erected.
2:40:18/Moses erected the tabernacle, secured its bases, set up its frames, inserted its bars, and raised its pillars.
2:40:19/He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:20/He took the covenant law and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark, and put the atonement cover on top of the ark.
2:40:21/He brought the ark into the tabernacle, set up the curtain shield, and shielded the ark of the covenant, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:22/He placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain.
2:40:23/He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:24/He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle.
2:40:25/He lit the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:26/He placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain.
2:40:27/He burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:28/He set up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
2:40:29/He placed the altar of burnt offering near the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:30/He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
2:40:31/Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet there.
2:40:32/Whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, they washed, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
2:40:33/He erected the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar and set up the curtain at the courtyard entrance. Thus Moses completed the work.
2:40:34/Then a cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
2:40:35/Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
2:40:36/Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, the Israelites set out on all their journeys.
2:40:37/But if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out until the day it lifted.
2:40:38/For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels.
3:1:1/The LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying,
3:1:2/Tell the Israelites, if anyone wants to present an offering to the LORD, you must bring your offering from the cattle, including the herd and the flock.
3:1:3/If the offering is a burnt sacrifice from the herd, it must be a flawless male. It should be offered willingly at the entrance of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD.
3:1:4/He must place his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
3:1:5/He must slaughter the bull before the LORD, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will present the blood and sprinkle it around the altar at the entrance of the tabernacle of meeting.
3:1:6/He must skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.

3:1:10/If the offering is from the flock, either sheep or goats, for a burnt sacrifice, it must be a flawless male.
3:1:11/He must slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood around the altar.

3:1:17/He must split it open at the wings but not sever it completely, and the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:2:1/When someone wants to present a grain offering to the LORD, it should consist of fine flour. They must pour oil on it and add frankincense.
3:2:2/They must bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests. The priest will take a handful of the flour and oil, along with all the frankincense, and burn it on the altar as a memorial offering. It's a fire offering, pleasing to the LORD.
3:2:3/The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons. It is most sacred among the LORD's fire offerings.
3:2:4/If you present a grain offering that's baked in an oven, it should be unleavened loaves made of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
3:2:5/If your offering is a grain offering prepared on a griddle, it should be made of fine flour, unleavened and mixed with oil.

3:2:9/The priest will take a portion of the grain offering as a memorial and burn it on the altar. It's a fire offering, pleasing to the LORD.
3:2:10/What's left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons. It is most sacred among the LORD's fire offerings.

3:2:12/When you offer the first fruits as an offering to the LORD, they should not be burned on the altar for a pleasing aroma.

3:2:15/Pour oil on it and place frankincense on it. It's a grain offering.
3:2:16/The priest will burn part of the crushed grain and some of the oil, along with all the frankincense, as a memorial. It's a fire offering to the LORD.

3:3:17/This is to be a lasting ordinance for your generations wherever you live: you must not eat any fat or any blood.
3:4:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:4:2/Tell the Israelites, if anyone unintentionally sins by breaking any of the LORD's commands about things they shouldn't do, and they do it anyway:
3:4:3/If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then he must bring a young, flawless bull to the LORD as a sin offering for the sin he committed.
3:4:4/He must bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull's head, and slaughter it in the LORD's presence.
3:4:5/Then the anointed priest must take some of the bull's blood into the Tent of Meeting.
3:4:6/The priest must dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary.
3:4:7/The priest must put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the LORD, which is in the Tent of Meeting, and pour out the rest of the bull's blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
3:4:8/He must remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering; the fat that covers the internal organs, and all the fat that is attached to them,
3:4:9/And the two kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys,
3:4:10/Just as these are removed from the bull of the fellowship offering, and the priest must burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
3:4:11/And the bull's skin, all its meat, its head, legs, internal organs, and waste,
3:4:12/Must be carried outside the camp to a clean place where the ashes are poured out, and burned on a wood fire; it must be burned where the ashes are poured out.
3:4:13/If the entire Israelite community sins unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they do something against any of the LORD's commands that should not be done, they are guilty.
3:4:14/When the sin they have committed becomes known, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting.
3:4:15/The elders of the community must lay their hands on the bull's head before the LORD, and the bull must be slaughtered before the LORD.
3:4:16/The anointed priest must bring some of the bull's blood into the Tent of Meeting,
3:4:17/And the priest must dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the curtain.
3:4:18/He must put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
3:4:19/He must remove all its fat and burn it on the altar.
3:4:20/He must do with this bull just as he did with the bull for the sin offering; in this way the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.
3:4:21/Then he must take the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is a sin offering for the community.
3:4:22/When a leader sins unintentionally and does something against any of the commands of the LORD his God that should not be done, and is guilty,
3:4:23/Or if his sin that he has committed is made known to him, he must bring as his offering a male goat without any defects.
3:4:24/He must lay his hand on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering.
3:4:25/The priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
3:4:26/He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the fellowship offerings. Thus the priest will make atonement for him for his sin, and he will be forgiven.
3:4:27/If any member of the community sins unintentionally and does something against any of the LORD's commands that should not be done, and is guilty,
3:4:28/Or if his sin that he has committed is made known to him, he must bring as his offering a female goat without any defects for the sin he has committed.
3:4:29/He must lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.
3:4:30/The priest must take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
3:4:31/He must remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from the fellowship offering, and the priest must burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. In this way, the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
3:4:32/If he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he must bring a female without any defects.
3:4:33/He must lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering at the place where they slaughter the burnt offering.
3:4:34/The priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
3:4:35/He must remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the fellowship offering, and the priest must burn them on the altar, on top of the offerings made by fire to the LORD. In this way, the priest will make atonement for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
3:5:1/If someone sins by hearing a call to testify about something they've seen or know about and they fail to report it, they will be held responsible for their sin.
3:5:2/Or if someone touches anything unclean, whether it's the dead body of an unclean animal, livestock, or a small creature, and they are unaware of it at the time; they too will be unclean and guilty.
3:5:3/Or if they touch any human impurity, whatever the source of impurity that a person can become contaminated with, and it is unknown to them at the time; when they become aware, they will be guilty.
3:5:4/Or if someone makes a rash promise, whether to do something bad or good, any kind of oath people might swear, and they are unaware of it at the time; when they realize it, they will be guilty of one of these offenses.
3:5:5/When someone is guilty of any of these things, they must confess the sin they have committed.
3:5:6/They must bring a guilt offering to the LORD for the sin they have committed, a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering; and the priest will make atonement for them for their sin.
3:5:7/If they cannot afford a lamb, they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the LORD as a penalty for their sin—one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
3:5:8/They are to bring them to the priest, who will first offer the one for the sin offering. He is to wring its head from its neck without severing it completely.
3:5:9/He is to sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; the rest of the blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
3:5:10/Then he is to offer the second bird as a burnt offering according to the prescribed manner. The priest will make atonement for them for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:11/But if they cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, they must bring as their offering for the sin they have committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. They must not put oil or incense on it, because it is a sin offering.
3:5:12/They are to bring it to the priest, who will take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar on top of the offerings made by fire to the LORD. It is a sin offering.
3:5:13/The priest will make atonement for them for the sin they have committed in any of these ways, and they will be forgiven. The rest of the offering will belong to the priest, as with the grain offering.
3:5:14/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:5:15/If someone commits a sin by unintentionally defiling the LORD's holy things, they must bring a ram without defect from the flock, valued in silver shekels, as a guilt offering to the LORD.
3:5:16/They must make restitution for what they have done wrong in regard to the holy thing, and add a fifth of its value to it and give it to the priest. The priest will make atonement for them with the ram of the guilt offering, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:17/If someone sins by doing something prohibited by the LORD's commands, even if they are unaware of it, they are guilty and will be held responsible.
3:5:18/They must bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock, valued according to the prescribed amount, as a guilt offering. The priest will make atonement for them for the unintentional sin they committed without knowing it, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:19/It is a guilt offering; they have indeed been guilty of wrongdoing against the LORD.
3:6:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:6:2/If someone sins by betraying the LORD and lies to their neighbor about something entrusted to them, or about a partnership, or about something taken by force, or if they have cheated their neighbor;
3:6:3/Or if they find something lost and lie about it, or swear falsely about any of these things that someone might do, thereby sinning in the process;
3:6:4/Then, because they have sinned and are guilty, they must return what they took by force, or what they obtained by deceit, or what was entrusted to them, or the lost item they found,
3:6:5/Or anything about which they have sworn falsely. They must fully repay the value, add a fifth more to it, and give it to the rightful owner on the day they present their guilt offering.
3:6:6/They must bring their guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without defect from the flock, valued according to your assessment, as a guilt offering to the priest.
3:6:7/And the priest shall make atonement for them before the LORD, and they will be forgiven for any of the things they might have done to become guilty.
3:6:8/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:6:9/Instruct Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain on the altar hearth throughout the night until morning, while the fire of the altar is kept burning on it.
3:6:10/The priest shall wear his linen robe, and he shall wear linen undergarments next to his body. He shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar.
3:6:11/Then he shall remove his garments, put on others, and take the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
3:6:12/The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest shall add wood to it, arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the fat of the peace offerings on it.
3:6:13/The fire must always be burning on the altar; it must never go out.
3:6:14/This is the law of the grain offering: Aaron's sons shall present it before the LORD, in front of the altar.
3:6:15/He shall take a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, together with its oil and all the incense on the grain offering, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:6:16/The rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It must be eaten without yeast in a holy place; they shall eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
3:6:17/It must not be baked with yeast. I have assigned it as their share of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
3:6:18/All the males among the descendants of Aaron may eat it. It is a perpetual statute throughout your generations from the LORD's offerings made by fire. Anyone who touches them will become holy.
3:6:19/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:6:20/This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to bring to the LORD on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half in the morning and half in the evening.
3:6:21/It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle; bring it well-mixed and present the grain offering broken in pieces as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:6:22/The priest from among Aaron's sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it. It is a perpetual statute: it shall be wholly burned to the LORD.
3:6:23/Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned; it shall not be eaten.
3:6:24/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:6:25/Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD; it is most holy.
3:6:26/The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
3:6:27/Anything that touches its flesh shall become holy; and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place.
3:6:28/But the earthen vessel in which it is cooked shall be broken; and if it is cooked in a bronze pot, it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
3:6:29/All the males among the priests may eat it; it is most holy.
3:6:30/No sin offering, from which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burned in the fire.
3:7:1/This is the rule for the guilt offering: it is very sacred.
3:7:2/In the same place where they kill the burnt offering, they should kill the guilt offering. The priest must then sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.
3:7:3/He must present all its fat: the tail, and the fat covering the internal organs,
3:7:4/Both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the covering over the liver, which he must remove with the kidneys.
3:7:5/The priest will burn these parts on the altar as a fire offering to the LORD. This is a guilt offering.
3:7:6/Every male priest may eat it, but it must be eaten in a sacred place; it is very sacred.
3:7:7/The guilt offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for both. The priest who makes atonement with it gets to keep it.
3:7:8/And the priest who offers someone's burnt offering gets to keep the skin of the burnt offering he has presented.
3:7:9/Any grain offering baked in an oven, prepared on a griddle, or cooked in a pan belongs to the priest who offers it.
3:7:10/All grain offerings, whether mixed with oil or dry, belong equally to all of Aaron's sons.
3:7:11/This is the rule for the fellowship offering presented to the LORD.
3:7:12/If someone offers it to express thankfulness, then along with the thank offering of unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and fried,
3:7:13/They must also offer loaves of leavened bread with their thanksgiving fellowship offering.
3:7:14/From each offering, they must present one of each kind as a contribution to the LORD; it will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offerings.
3:7:15/The meat of their thanksgiving fellowship offering must be eaten on the day it is offered; they must not leave any of it until morning.
3:7:16/But if the offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it must be eaten on the day the offering is made, and any leftovers may be eaten the next day.
3:7:17/Any of the meat left until the third day must be burned up.
3:7:18/If any of the meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not count for the one who offered it; it will be considered tainted, and the person who eats any of it will be held responsible.
3:7:19/Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it.
3:7:20/But if anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD, that person must be cut off from their people.
3:7:21/If anyone touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean detestable thing—and then eats any of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD, that person must be cut off from their people.
3:7:22/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:7:23/Tell the Israelites: You must not eat any fat from an ox, sheep, or goat.
3:7:24/The fat of an animal that dies naturally or is torn by wild animals can be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.
3:7:25/Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which an offering by fire is made to the LORD must be cut off from their people.
3:7:26/You must not eat any blood, whether from birds or animals, in any of your homes.
3:7:27/Anyone who eats any blood must be cut off from their people.
3:7:28/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:7:29/Tell the Israelites: Anyone who offers a fellowship offering to the LORD must bring part of it as their sacrifice to the LORD.
3:7:30/With their own hands they must bring the offerings made by fire to the LORD; they must bring the fat together with the breast, and the breast must be waved as a wave offering before the LORD.
3:7:31/The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
3:7:32/You must give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
3:7:33/The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his portion.
3:7:34/For the wave breast and the contribution thigh, I have taken from the Israelites out of their fellowship offerings and given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their due forever from the Israelites.
3:7:35/This is the portion from the fire offerings to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests;
3:7:36/Which the LORD commanded to be given to them by the Israelites on the day he anointed them—a lasting ordinance for their generations.
3:7:37/This is the rule for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the fellowship offering,
3:7:38/Which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he ordered the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Desert of Sinai.
3:8:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:8:2/Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, a bull for the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
3:8:3/Gather the entire community at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
3:8:4/Moses did as the LORD instructed; the community was gathered at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
3:8:5/Moses told the community, "This is what the LORD has ordered to be done."
3:8:6/Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
3:8:7/He dressed him in the tunic, tied the sash around him, put on the robe, placed the ephod on him, and fastened the intricately woven band of the ephod around him, securing it to him.
3:8:8/He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
3:8:9/He placed the turban on his head and on the turban, right on the front, he placed the gold plate, the sacred emblem, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3:8:10/Moses took the anointing oil and consecrated the tabernacle and everything in it, making them holy.
3:8:11/He sprinkled some on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils, as well as the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
3:8:12/He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.
3:8:13/Moses brought Aaron's sons forward, dressed them in tunics, tied sashes around them, and put headbands on them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3:8:14/He presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
3:8:15/He slaughtered it; Moses took the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar all around with his finger, purifying the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar, consecrating it to make atonement for it.
3:8:16/He took all the fat on the internal organs, the covering of the liver, both kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
3:8:17/But the bull, its hide, flesh, and waste, he burned outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3:8:18/He presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
3:8:19/He slaughtered it; Moses splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.
3:8:20/He cut the ram into pieces; Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.
3:8:21/After washing the internal organs and the legs with water, Moses burned the entire ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3:8:22/He presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
3:8:23/He slaughtered it; Moses took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
3:8:24/He brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses then splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.
3:8:25/He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the covering of the liver, both kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh.
3:8:26/From the basket of unleavened bread before the LORD, he took one unleavened loaf, one loaf made with oil, and one wafer, and placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh.
3:8:27/He put all these in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.
3:8:28/Moses then took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3:8:29/Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses' share of the ordination ram, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3:8:30/Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. Thus, he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons, and their garments.
3:8:31/Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: 'Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'"
3:8:32/And whatever remains of the meat and bread, you must burn with fire.
3:8:33/You must not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days.
3:8:34/What has been done today was commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you.
3:8:35/You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and keep the LORD's charge so that you do not die; for this is what I have been commanded."
3:8:36/So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded through Moses.
3:9:1/On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel.
3:9:2/He told Aaron, "Take a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without any defects, and present them before the LORD."
3:9:3/Tell the Israelites, "Take a goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, both one year old and without any defects, for a burnt offering."
3:9:4/"Also take a bull and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD, along with a grain offering mixed with oil, because today the LORD will appear to you."
3:9:5/They brought what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire community came forward and stood before the LORD.
3:9:6/Moses said, "This is what the LORD has instructed you to do so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
3:9:7/Then Moses told Aaron, "Go to the altar, present your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and the people. Present the offering of the people and make atonement for them as the LORD has directed."
3:9:8/Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf for his own sin offering.
3:9:9/Aaron's sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
3:9:10/He burned the fat, the kidneys, and the covering of the liver from the sin offering on the altar, as the LORD had instructed Moses.
3:9:11/He burned the meat and the skin outside the camp.
3:9:12/He slaughtered the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, which he sprinkled all around the altar.
3:9:13/They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
3:9:14/He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
3:9:15/He then presented the people's offering, took the goat for the people's sin offering, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, just like the first one.
3:9:16/He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the regulations.
3:9:17/He also presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, in addition to the morning's burnt offering.
3:9:18/He slaughtered the bull and the ram as a peace offering for the people. Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
3:9:19/They handed him the fat from the bull and the ram, including the fat tail, the fat that covers the internal organs, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver.
3:9:20/They placed the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.
3:9:21/But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had instructed.
3:9:22/Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. After presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, he stepped down.
3:9:23/Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
3:9:24/Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.
3:10:1/And Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, each took his censer, filled it with fire, added incense, and presented unauthorized fire before the LORD, which He had not instructed them to do.
3:10:2/Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
3:10:3/Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD meant when He said, 'I will show my holiness through those who are near me, and before all the people I will be glorified.'" And Aaron remained silent.
3:10:4/Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel Aaron's uncle, and said to them, "Come here, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to outside the camp."
3:10:5/So they came forward and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, just as Moses had instructed.
3:10:6/Moses then said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your hair be unkempt, and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the LORD's wrath will strike the entire community. But let your relatives, the whole house of Israel, mourn the fire the LORD has ignited.
3:10:7/Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting, or you will die, because the LORD's anointing oil is on you." And they did as Moses said.
3:10:8/And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
3:10:9/"Do not consume wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you enter the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come,
3:10:10/so that you can distinguish between the sacred and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean;
3:10:11/and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has spoken to them through Moses."
3:10:12/Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering left over from the LORD's offerings made by fire and eat it without yeast beside the altar because it is most holy.
3:10:13/Eat it in a sacred place, because it is your right and your sons' right, from the LORD's offerings made by fire; for this is what I have been commanded.
3:10:14/Also, the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented you are to eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons' due from the peace offerings of the Israelites.
3:10:15/The thigh that is presented and the breast that is waved must be brought with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to wave as a wave offering before the LORD; this will be your due and your sons' due forever, as the LORD has commanded."
3:10:16/And Moses carefully looked for the goat of the sin offering, and found it had been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's surviving sons, and asked,
3:10:17/"Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sacred area? It is most holy, and God gave it to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the LORD.
3:10:18/See, its blood was not taken inside the holy place; you should have certainly eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."
3:10:19/Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, but such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the eyes of the LORD?"
3:10:20/When Moses heard this, he agreed.
3:11:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:11:2/Tell the Israelites: These are the animals you can eat from all the animals on the earth.
3:11:3/You may eat any animal that has a split hoof, is cloven-footed, and chews the cud.
3:11:4/However, you must not eat these animals that chew the cud or have split hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.
3:11:5/And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.
3:11:6/And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.
3:11:7/And the pig, though it has a split hoof and is cloven-footed, it does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you.
3:11:8/You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
3:11:9/You may eat any of these from the water: anything with fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, you may eat.
3:11:10/But anything in the seas or rivers that does not have fins and scales, all that move in the waters, and any living thing in the waters, is detestable to you.
3:11:11/They are to be detestable to you; you must not eat their meat, and you must regard their carcasses as detestable.
3:11:12/Anything in the waters without fins or scales is detestable to you.
3:11:13/These are the birds you are to regard as detestable and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,
3:11:14/And the kite and the falcon of any kind;
3:11:15/Every kind of raven;
3:11:16/And the owl, the night hawk, the cuckoo, and the hawk of any kind,
3:11:17/And the little owl, the cormorant, and the great owl,
3:11:18/And the white owl, the pelican, and the carrion vulture,
3:11:19/And the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
3:11:20/All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
3:11:21/Yet you may eat flying insects that walk on all fours, with legs above their feet to leap on the earth.
3:11:22/These you may eat: any kind of locust, any kind of katydid, any kind of cricket, and any kind of grasshopper.
3:11:23/But all other flying insects that have four legs are detestable to you.
3:11:24/By these you will become unclean: whoever touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening.
3:11:25/And whoever carries any part of their carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening.
3:11:26/The carcasses of any animals that have split hooves but are not cloven-footed or do not chew the cud are unclean to you; anyone who touches them will be unclean.
3:11:27/And any animals that walk on their paws, among all animals that walk on all fours, are unclean to you; anyone who touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening.
3:11:28/And anyone who carries their carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
3:11:29/These also are unclean to you among the creatures that crawl on the earth: the weasel, the mouse, and the tortoise of any kind,
3:11:30/And the ferret, the chameleon, the lizard, the snail, and the mole.
3:11:31/These are unclean to you among all that crawl; whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean until the evening.
3:11:32/And anything on which any of them falls when they are dead will be unclean; whether it is any item of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, any item that is used for work, it must be put into water, and it will be unclean until the evening; then it will be clean.
3:11:33/And any clay pot into which any of them falls, everything in it will be unclean, and you must break it.
3:11:34/Any food that could be eaten but has water on it from such a pot is unclean, and any liquid that could be drunk in any such pot is unclean.
3:11:35/And anything on which part of their carcass falls will be unclean; whether oven or cooking stoves, they must be broken down; they are unclean and will be unclean to you.
3:11:36/Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern holding water will be clean, but anyone who touches their carcass will be unclean.
3:11:37/If part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing that is to be sown, it is clean.
3:11:38/But if water is put on the seed and part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
3:11:39/If any animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass will be unclean until the evening.
3:11:40/And anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening; anyone who carries the carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening.
3:11:41/And every creature that crawls on the ground is detestable; it must not be eaten.
3:11:42/Anything that crawls on its belly, anything that walks on all fours, or anything that has many feet among all creatures that crawl on the ground, you must not eat; for they are detestable.
3:11:43/Do not make yourselves detestable with any crawling creature that crawls, and do not make yourselves unclean with them, so that you become unclean.
3:11:44/For I am the LORD your God; you must therefore consecrate yourselves, and you shall be holy, for I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean with any creature that crawls on the ground.
3:11:45/For I am the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
3:11:46/This is the law concerning animals, birds, every living creature that moves in the waters, and every creature that crawls on the earth,
3:11:47/To distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the animals that may be eaten and the animals that may not be eaten.
3:12:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:12:2/Tell the Israelites, if a woman gives birth to a boy, she will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her menstrual period.
3:12:3/On the eighth day, the boy's foreskin must be circumcised.
3:12:4/Then she must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.
3:12:5/But if she gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean for two weeks, as during her period, and she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding.
3:12:6/When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.
3:12:7/The priest shall offer them before the LORD to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood. This is the law for a woman who gives birth to either a boy or a girl.
3:12:8/If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.
3:13:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:13:2/When someone has a swelling, a rash, or a bright spot on their skin, and it looks like the skin disease leprosy, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or one of his sons who are priests.
3:13:3/The priest will examine the sore on the skin, and if the hair in the sore has turned white and the appearance of the sore is deeper than the skin, it is a case of leprosy. The priest will examine him and declare him unclean.
3:13:4/If the bright spot is white on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair has not turned white, then the priest will isolate the affected person for seven days.
3:13:5/On the seventh day, the priest will examine him again. If the sore appears unchanged and has not spread in the skin, the priest will isolate him for another seven days.
3:13:6/On the seventh day, the priest will examine him again. If the sore has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest will declare him clean; it is only a rash. He must wash his clothes and he will be clean.
3:13:7/But if the rash spreads widely in the skin after he has been seen by the priest and declared clean, he must be seen by the priest again.
3:13:8/If the priest sees that the rash has spread in the skin, he will declare him unclean; it is indeed leprosy.
3:13:9/When someone has leprosy, they must be brought to the priest.
3:13:10/And the priest will examine him. If there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
3:13:11/It is a chronic case of leprosy in the skin. The priest will declare him unclean without isolating him, for he is clearly unclean.
3:13:12/If leprosy breaks out all over the skin and covers all the skin from head to foot,
3:13:13/The priest will examine him. If the leprosy has covered all his body, the priest will declare the affected person clean; it has all turned white, and he is clean.
3:13:14/But as soon as raw flesh appears, he will be unclean.
3:13:15/The priest will examine the raw flesh and declare him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.
3:13:16/If the raw flesh turns white again, he must go to the priest.
3:13:17/The priest will examine him, and if the sore has turned white, the priest will declare the affected person clean; he is clean.
3:13:18/Also, if there is a boil on the skin that has healed,
3:13:19/And in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, it must be shown to the priest.
3:13:20/If the priest sees that it appears to be lower than the skin and the hair has turned white, he will declare him unclean; it is a case of leprosy that has broken out in the boil.
3:13:21/But if the priest examines it and there are no white hairs in it, and it is not lower than the skin but has faded, the priest will isolate him for seven days.
3:13:22/If it spreads widely in the skin, the priest will declare him unclean; it is a case of leprosy.
3:13:23/But if the bright spot stays in its place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest will declare him clean.
3:13:24/Or if there is any flesh with a burn from fire, and the healed burn has a white or reddish-white bright spot,
3:13:25/The priest will examine it. If the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the burn. The priest will declare him unclean; it is a case of leprosy.
3:13:26/But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is not lower than the skin but has faded, the priest will isolate him for seven days.
3:13:27/On the seventh day, the priest will examine him. If it has spread widely in the skin, the priest will declare him unclean; it is a case of leprosy.
3:13:28/But if the bright spot stays in its place and does not spread in the skin and has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest will declare him clean; it is the scar of the burn.
3:13:29/If a man or woman has a sore on the head or the beard,
3:13:30/The priest will examine the sore. If it appears to be deeper than the skin and there is thin yellow hair in it, the priest will declare him unclean; it is a fungal infection, a case of leprosy on the head or beard.
3:13:31/But if the priest examines the sore of the fungal infection and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest will isolate the person with the fungal infection for seven days.
3:13:32/On the seventh day, the priest will examine the sore. If the fungal infection has not spread, there is no yellow hair in it, and the fungal infection does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
3:13:33/The person must shave themselves, except for the fungal infection. The priest will isolate the person with the fungal infection for another seven days.
3:13:34/On the seventh day, the priest will examine the fungal infection. If it has not spread in the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, then the priest will declare him clean. He must wash his clothes and he will be clean.
3:13:35/But if the fungal infection spreads widely in the skin after his cleansing,
3:13:36/The priest will examine him. If the fungal infection has spread in the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; he is unclean.
3:13:37/But if the fungal infection is stable and black hair has grown in it, the fungal infection is healed; he is clean. The priest will declare him clean.
3:13:38/If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of their flesh, white bright spots,
3:13:39/The priest will examine them. If the bright spots on the skin of their flesh are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.
3:13:40/And if a man's hair falls out from his head, he is bald; but he is clean.
3:13:41/And if his hair falls out from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; but he is clean.
3:13:42/But if there is a white reddish sore on the bald head or forehead, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or forehead.
3:13:43/The priest will examine it, and if the swelling of the sore is white reddish on his bald head or forehead, similar to leprosy on the skin of the body,
3:13:44/He is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest must declare him utterly unclean; his infection is on his head.
3:13:45/The person with leprosy must wear torn clothes, leave his hair uncombed, cover his upper lip, and cry out, 'Unclean, unclean.'
3:13:46/As long as the disease lasts, he will be unclean. He must live alone; he must live outside the camp.
3:13:47/Any clothing that has the leprosy disease, whether woolen or linen,
3:13:48/Whether in the warp or woof of linen or wool, or in leather or anything made of leather,
3:13:49/If the disease is greenish or reddish in the clothing, or in the leather, or in the warp or woof, or in any leather article, it is a leprous disease and must be shown to the priest.
3:13:50/The priest will examine the disease and isolate the affected article for seven days.
3:13:51/He will examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the clothing, whether in the warp, woof, leather, or anything made of leather, the disease is a persistent leprosy; it is unclean.
3:13:52/He must therefore burn the clothing, whether warp or woof, woolen or linen, or any leather article that has the disease, for it is a persistent leprous disease; it must be burned in the fire.
3:13:53/But if the priest examines it and the disease has not spread in the clothing, whether in the warp or woof or in any leather article,
3:13:54/Then the priest will order that the affected article be washed and isolated for another seven days.
3:13:55/After the article with the disease has been washed, the priest will examine it again. If the disease has not changed its appearance, even though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you must burn it in the fire. It is a deep infection, whether the bare spot is inside or outside.
3:13:56/And if the priest examines it and the disease has faded after it has been washed, he is to tear the diseased part out of the clothing, or the leather, or the warp, or the woof.
3:13:57/But if it appears again in the clothing, whether in the warp or woof, or in any leather article, it is spreading; you must burn the affected article with fire.
3:13:58/The clothing, whether warp or woof, or any leather article, which has been washed and from which the disease has departed, must be washed again and it will be clean.
3:13:59/This is the law concerning a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in any leather article, to declare it clean or unclean.
3:14:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:14:2/This is the procedure for a leper on the day of their cleansing: They must be brought to the priest.
3:14:3/The priest shall go outside the camp; the priest shall examine the person, and if the leprosy has healed,
3:14:4/Then the priest shall order that two live, clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the person to be cleansed.
3:14:5/The priest shall command that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot.
3:14:6/As for the live bird, he shall take it, along with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
3:14:7/He shall sprinkle the person to be cleansed from leprosy seven times, declare them clean, and then release the live bird into the open field.
3:14:8/The person being cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe in water to be clean. After that, they may enter the camp but must stay outside their tent for seven days.
3:14:9/On the seventh day, they must shave off all their hair: their head, beard, eyebrows—every bit of hair. They must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be clean.
3:14:10/On the eighth day, they must bring two male lambs without defect, one year-old female lamb without defect, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil.
3:14:11/The priest who performs the cleansing will present the person to be cleansed, along with these offerings, before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
3:14:12/The priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
3:14:13/He shall slaughter the lamb in the sacred place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
3:14:14/The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot.
3:14:15/The priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.
3:14:16/The priest shall dip his right finger in the oil in his left hand and sprinkle some of the oil seven times before the LORD.
3:14:17/With the rest of the oil in his hand, the priest shall put some on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
3:14:18/The remaining oil in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for them before the LORD.
3:14:19/The priest shall then offer the sin offering to make atonement for the one to be cleansed from their impurity. Afterward, he shall slaughter the burnt offering.
3:14:20/The priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus, the priest makes atonement for them, and they will be clean.
3:14:21/If they are poor and cannot afford so much, they shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for them, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, a log of oil,
3:14:22/And two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whatever they can afford. One will be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
3:14:23/On the eighth day, they shall bring them for their cleansing to the priest, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, before the LORD.
3:14:24/The priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
3:14:25/He shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering. The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot.
3:14:26/The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.
3:14:27/The priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil from his left hand seven times before the LORD.
3:14:28/The priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, on the places where he put the blood of the guilt offering.
3:14:29/The rest of the oil in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for them before the LORD.
3:14:30/He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, whichever they can afford.
3:14:31/Whatever they can afford, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, along with the grain offering. The priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the one to be cleansed.
3:14:32/This is the law for anyone with a leprous disease who cannot afford the offerings for their cleansing.
3:14:33/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:14:34/When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,
3:14:35/And the owner of the house comes and tells the priest, 'It seems to me there is something like a disease in the house,'
3:14:36/The priest shall order that they empty the house before the priest goes in to examine the disease, so that everything in the house will not become unclean. After that, the priest shall go in to see the house.
3:14:37/He shall examine the disease, and if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface,
3:14:38/The priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house for seven days.
3:14:39/The priest shall return on the seventh day and inspect the house. If the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
3:14:40/The priest shall order that they remove the stones in which the disease appears and throw them into an unclean place outside the city.
3:14:41/He shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall dump the plaster that they scrape off outside the city in an unclean place.
3:14:42/Then they shall take other stones and replace those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house.
3:14:43/If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has removed the stones and scraped and replastered the house,
3:14:44/The priest shall come and inspect it. If the disease has spread in the house, it is a persistent leprous disease in the house; it is unclean.
3:14:45/He shall tear down the house, its stones, its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and carry them out of the city to an unclean place.
3:14:46/Moreover, anyone who enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.
3:14:47/And whoever sleeps in the house shall wash their clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash their clothes.
3:14:48/But if the priest comes in and examines it and the disease has not spread in the house after the house was replastered, then the priest shall declare the house clean, because the disease is healed.
3:14:49/To cleanse the house, he shall take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop.
3:14:50/He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
3:14:51/Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
3:14:52/He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn.
3:14:53/Then he shall release the live bird outside the city into the open fields. Thus he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
3:14:54/This is the law for any kind of leprous disease and scale,
3:14:55/For the leprosy of a garment and of a house,
3:14:56/For a swelling, a rash, or a bright spot,
3:14:57/To determine when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.
3:15:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:15:2/Tell the Israelites, when any man has a bodily discharge, he is unclean because of it.
3:15:3/This is how his uncleanliness from his discharge will be determined: whether his body allows the discharge to flow or blocks it, he is unclean.
3:15:4/Any bed the person with the discharge lies on is unclean, and anything he sits on is unclean.
3:15:5/Anyone who touches his bed must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:6/Anyone who sits on anything the person with the discharge has sat on must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:7/Anyone who touches the body of the person with the discharge must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:8/If the person with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, they must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:9/Any saddle the person with the discharge rides on will be unclean.
3:15:10/Anyone who touches anything that was under the person with the discharge will be unclean until evening; anyone who carries those things must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:11/Anyone the person with the discharge touches without having rinsed their hands in water must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:12/Any clay pot the person with the discharge touches must be broken, and any wooden article must be rinsed in water.
3:15:13/When the person with the discharge is cleansed of it, they must count off seven days for their cleansing, wash their clothes, and bathe their body in fresh water; then they will be clean.
3:15:14/On the eighth day, they must take two doves or two young pigeons and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.
3:15:15/The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for them before the LORD for their discharge.
3:15:16/If a man's semen goes out from him, he must wash all his body in water, and be unclean until evening.
3:15:17/Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be washed with water, and be unclean until evening.
3:15:18/If a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, they both must bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
3:15:19/If a woman has a discharge and it is blood from her body, she will be in her menstrual period for seven days; anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening.
3:15:20/Anything she lies on during her period will be unclean; anything she sits on will be unclean.
3:15:21/Anyone who touches her bed must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:22/Anyone who touches anything she sat on must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:23/If it's on her bed or anything she sits on when he touches it, he will be unclean until evening.
3:15:24/If a man lies with her and her menstrual flow touches him, he will be unclean for seven days; every bed he lies on will be unclean.
3:15:25/If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days outside her menstrual period, or if it continues beyond her period, she will be unclean as during her period.
3:15:26/Every bed she lies on all the days of her discharge will be to her as the bed of her period; and whatever she sits on will be unclean, as during her period.
3:15:27/Anyone who touches those things will be unclean; they must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.
3:15:28/But if she is cleansed of her discharge, she must count off seven days, and after that she will be clean.
3:15:29/On the eighth day she must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
3:15:30/The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for the uncleanness of her discharge.
3:15:31/This is how you will separate the Israelites from their uncleanness, so they do not die in their uncleanness by defiling my dwelling place, which is among them.
3:15:32/This is the law for a person with a discharge, for anyone whose semen goes out from him and becomes unclean because of it,
3:15:33/For a woman in her menstrual period, for anyone with a discharge, whether male or female, and for a man who lies with a woman who is unclean.
3:16:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses after Aaron's two sons died because they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD.
3:16:2/And the LORD said to Moses, "Tell your brother Aaron not to enter the sanctuary inside the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark anytime he wants, so he won't die. I will appear in a cloud over the atonement cover.
3:16:3/This is how Aaron is to enter the sanctuary area: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
3:16:4/He must wear a sacred linen tunic and linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie a linen sash around him and put on a linen turban. These are sacred garments, so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.
3:16:5/He is to take from the Israelite community two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
3:16:6/Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.
3:16:7/Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
3:16:8/Aaron is to cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat.
3:16:9/Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the LORD and sacrifice it for a sin offering.
3:16:10/But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat.
3:16:11/Then Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he shall slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
3:16:12/He is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain.
3:16:13/He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony, so he will not die.
3:16:14/He is to take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
3:16:15/He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.
3:16:16/In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He is to do the same for the tent of meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
3:16:17/No one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household and the whole community of Israel.
3:16:18/Then he shall come out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
3:16:19/He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
3:16:20/When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat.
3:16:21/He is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat's head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task.
3:16:22/The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place; and the man shall release it in the wilderness.
3:16:23/Then Aaron is to go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is to leave them there.
3:16:24/He shall bathe himself with water in the sanctuary area and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, making atonement for himself and for the people.
3:16:25/The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
3:16:26/The man who releases the goat as the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come back into the camp.
3:16:27/The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the sanctuary to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh, and intestines are to be burned up.
3:16:28/The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come back into the camp.
3:16:29/This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month you must deny yourselves and not do any work—whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you—
3:16:30/because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the LORD, you will be clean from all your sins.
3:16:31/It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance.
3:16:32/The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments
3:16:33/and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the tent of meeting and the altar, and for the priests and all the members of the community.
3:16:34/This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites." And it was done as the LORD commanded Moses.
3:17:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:17:2/Tell Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, 'This is what the LORD has commanded:
3:17:3/Any Israelite who slaughters an ox, lamb, or goat, whether inside or outside the camp,
3:17:4/And does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD in front of the LORD's dwelling; that person will be considered guilty of bloodshed; they have shed blood and will be cut off from their people.
3:17:5/This is so the Israelites will bring the sacrifices they used to offer in the open fields to the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings to the LORD.
3:17:6/The priest shall then sprinkle the blood on the LORD's altar at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:17:7/They must no longer offer any sacrifices to goat idols, which they have been unfaithfully following. This is a permanent law for them throughout their generations.
3:17:8/Tell them, 'Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
3:17:9/And does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to present it to the LORD, that person will be cut off from their people.
3:17:10/And any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who consumes any kind of blood; I will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut them off from their people.
3:17:11/For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.
3:17:12/That is why I have told the Israelites, 'None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner residing among you eat blood.'
3:17:13/Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with earth.
3:17:14/Because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have told the Israelites, 'You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off.'
3:17:15/Anyone who eats what has died naturally or has been killed by another animal, whether they are a native or a foreigner, must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean until evening; then they will be clean.
3:17:16/But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe themselves, they will be held responsible.
3:18:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:18:2/Tell the children of Israel, and say to them, I am the LORD your God.
3:18:3/Do not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you lived, nor of the land of Canaan, where I am taking you. Do not follow their customs.
3:18:4/You must follow my laws and be careful to obey my decrees. I am the LORD your God.
3:18:5/Therefore, you must keep my statutes and my laws, which if a person follows, they will live by them. I am the LORD.
3:18:6/None of you shall approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.
3:18:7/Do not have sexual relations with your father or your mother. She is your mother; do not have sexual relations with her.
3:18:8/Do not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; that would dishonor your father.
3:18:9/Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.
3:18:10/Do not have sexual relations with your granddaughter, whether your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; that would dishonor you.
3:18:11/Do not have sexual relations with your step-sister, the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister.
3:18:12/Do not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.
3:18:13/Do not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, because she is your mother’s close relative.
3:18:14/Do not have sexual relations with your father’s brother, nor approach his wife; she is your aunt.
3:18:15/Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; do not have sexual relations with her.
3:18:16/Do not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would dishonor your brother.
3:18:17/Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not take her granddaughter, whether her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to have sexual relations. They are close relatives; that is wickedness.
3:18:18/Do not take your wife's sister as a rival wife to have sexual relations with her while your wife is living.
3:18:19/Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her menstrual period.
3:18:20/Do not have sexual relations with your neighbor’s wife, defiling yourself with her.
3:18:21/Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
3:18:22/Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.
3:18:23/Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.
3:18:24/Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.
3:18:25/And the land became defiled, so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
3:18:26/But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the foreigners residing among you must not do any of these detestable things,
3:18:27/for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled.
3:18:28/If you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.
3:18:29/Everyone who does any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people.
3:18:30/So you must keep my charge not to do any of these abominable customs that were done before you, and not defile yourselves with them. I am the LORD your God.
3:19:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:19:2/Tell the entire community of the children of Israel, 'You must be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.'
3:19:3/Everyone must respect his mother and father, and keep my Sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
3:19:4/Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves any gods of cast metal: I am the LORD your God.
3:19:5/If you present a peace offering to the LORD, you must do it willingly.
3:19:6/It must be eaten on the day you offer it or on the next day; anything left until the third day must be burned.
3:19:7/If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is contaminated and will not be accepted.
3:19:8/Therefore, anyone who eats it will be responsible for his sin, for he has desecrated what is holy to the LORD: that person will be cut off from his people.
3:19:9/When you harvest your land's crop, do not harvest all the way to the edges of your field, or gather the leftovers of your harvest.
3:19:10/Do not pick your vineyard clean or gather every grape; leave them for the poor and the foreigner: I am the LORD your God.
3:19:11/Do not steal, do not deceive, and do not lie to one another.
3:19:12/Do not swear falsely by my name, thereby profaning the name of your God: I am the LORD.
3:19:13/Do not cheat your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired worker must not remain with you all night until morning.
3:19:14/Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but fear your God: I am the LORD.
3:19:15/Do not do injustice in court: do not be biased toward the poor or favor the great, but judge your neighbor fairly.
3:19:16/Do not go about spreading slander among your people. Do not do anything that endangers your neighbor's life: I am the LORD.
3:19:17/Do not harbor hatred against your brother. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in his guilt.
3:19:18/Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.
3:19:19/Follow my decrees. Do not mate different kinds of animals. Do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material.
3:19:20/If a man sleeps with a female slave who is promised to another man but has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. They are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed.
3:19:21/He must bring a ram to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for a guilt offering to the LORD.
3:19:22/The priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin he has committed, and his sin will be forgiven.
3:19:23/When you enter the land and plant any kind of fruit tree, regard its fruit as forbidden. For three years you are to consider it forbidden; it must not be eaten.
3:19:24/In the fourth year all its fruit will be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD.
3:19:25/But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit. In this way your harvest will be increased: I am the LORD your God.
3:19:26/Do not eat any meat with the blood still in it. Do not practice divination or seek omens.
3:19:27/Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.
3:19:28/Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves: I am the LORD.
3:19:29/Do not degrade your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will turn to prostitution and be filled with wickedness.
3:19:30/Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
3:19:31/Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
3:19:32/Stand up in the presence of the aged, show respect for the elderly and revere your God: I am the LORD.
3:19:33/If a foreigner resides with you in your land, do not mistreat them.
3:19:34/The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
3:19:35/Do not do anything that is unfair in court, in measuring length, weight, or quantity.
3:19:36/Use honest scales, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt.
3:19:37/Therefore, keep all my decrees and all my laws and follow them: I am the LORD.
3:20:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:20:2/Tell the Israelites and the foreigners living in Israel that anyone who sacrifices any of their children to Molech must be put to death. The local community must stone them.
3:20:3/I will oppose that person and cut them off from their community because they have sacrificed their children to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and dishonoring my holy name.
3:20:4/If the local community turns a blind eye to someone sacrificing their children to Molech and does not put them to death,
3:20:5/then I will set my face against that person and their family, cutting them off along with everyone who follows them in prostituting themselves to Molech.
3:20:6/Anyone who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute themselves with them, I will set my face against them and cut them off from their people.
3:20:7/So set yourselves apart and be holy, because I am the LORD your God.
3:20:8/Keep my decrees and follow them. I am the LORD who makes you holy.
3:20:9/Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death. They have cursed their parent; their blood will be on their own head.
3:20:10/If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.
3:20:11/If a man sleeps with his father's wife, he has dishonored his father. Both of them must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
3:20:12/If a man sleeps with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death. They have committed a perversion; their blood will be on their own heads.
3:20:13/If a man has sexual relations with another man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
3:20:14/If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is wickedness. They must be burned in the fire, both he and they, so that no wickedness will be among you.
3:20:15/If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal.
3:20:16/If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
3:20:17/If a man takes his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he will bear the consequences of his guilt.
3:20:18/If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and uncovers her nakedness, he has exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them must be cut off from their people.
3:20:19/You must not have sexual relations with your aunt, whether your mother's sister or your father's sister. This would dishonor a close relative; both of you would bear the consequences of your guilt.
3:20:20/If a man sleeps with his uncle's wife, he has dishonored his uncle. They will bear the consequences of their sin; they will die childless.
3:20:21/If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they will be childless.
3:20:22/Therefore, keep all my statutes and all my judgments and do them, so that the land where I am bringing you to live will not vomit you out.
3:20:23/Do not follow the practices of the nation I am driving out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them.
3:20:24/But I have said to you, 'You will inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.' I am the LORD your God, who has set you apart from the nations.
3:20:25/You must therefore distinguish between clean and unclean animals and birds. Do not defile yourselves by animals or birds or anything else that moves along the ground—those which I have set apart as unclean for you.
3:20:26/You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be my own.
3:20:27/A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.
3:21:1/And the LORD said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and tell them: No one shall become ceremonially unclean for a dead person among his people,
3:21:2/Except for his closest relatives: his mother, father, son, daughter, and brother,
3:21:3/And for his unmarried sister who is close to him because she has no husband; for her, he may become unclean.
3:21:4/But as a leader among his people, he must not make himself unclean in a way that dishonors him.
3:21:5/They must not shave their heads or trim the edges of their beards or cut their bodies.
3:21:6/They must be holy to their God and not dishonor the name of their God. Since they present offerings made by fire to the LORD, the food of their God, they must be holy.
3:21:7/They must not marry a woman who has been defiled by prostitution or divorced from her husband, because they are holy to their God.
3:21:8/Treat him as holy because he offers the food of your God. He must be holy to you because I, the LORD who makes you holy, am holy.
3:21:9/If a priest's daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she dishonors her father; she must be burned in the fire.
3:21:10/The high priest, who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been dedicated to wear the sacred garments, must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes.
3:21:11/He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother.
3:21:12/He must not leave the sanctuary or desecrate the sanctuary of his God, for the dedication of the anointing oil of his God is on him. I am the LORD.
3:21:13/He must marry a woman in her virginity.
3:21:14/He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, a woman defiled by prostitution, or a woman who is not a virgin. He may only marry a virgin from his own people.
3:21:15/He must not defile his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who makes him holy."
3:21:16/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:21:17/"Tell Aaron: 'Anyone from your descendants throughout their generations who has a physical defect must not approach to offer the food of his God.
3:21:18/No man who has a defect may come near: no man who is blind, lame, disfigured, deformed,
3:21:19/Or a man who has a broken foot or hand,
3:21:20/Or is hunchbacked, dwarfed, has a defect in his eye, skin diseases, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles.
3:21:21/No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the LORD's offerings made by fire. He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God.
3:21:22/He may eat the food of his God, both the most holy and the holy.
3:21:23/However, he must not enter the curtain area or approach the altar because he has a defect, so that he does not desecrate my sanctuaries, for I am the LORD who makes them holy.'"
3:21:24/And Moses told this to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites.
3:22:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:22:2/Tell Aaron and his sons to keep away from the sacred offerings of the Israelites, so they do not dishonor my holy name by treating as common the offerings they dedicate to me: I am the LORD.
3:22:3/Tell them that anyone from their descendants, throughout their generations, who approaches the sacred offerings that the Israelites dedicate to the LORD while they are in a state of impurity, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
3:22:4/Any descendant of Aaron who has leprosy or a discharge must not eat the sacred offerings until they are clean. And anyone who touches anything made unclean by contact with the dead, or a man who has an emission of semen,
3:22:5/Or anyone who touches any crawling creature that might make them unclean, or a person who could make them unclean in any way whatsoever,
3:22:6/Anyone who has touched any such thing will be unclean until evening and must not eat the sacred offerings unless they bathe their body in water.
3:22:7/After the sun has set, they will be clean and may then eat the sacred offerings, for these are their food.
3:22:8/They must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make them unclean: I am the LORD.
3:22:9/Therefore, they must observe my instructions, lest they bear sin for it and die as a result if they profane it: I the LORD sanctify them.
3:22:10/No outsider may eat the sacred offering; neither a visitor of the priest nor a hired worker may eat the sacred offering.
3:22:11/But if a priest buys a person, that person may eat of it, and those born in his household may also eat his food.
3:22:12/If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider, she may not eat of the sacred offerings.
3:22:13/However, if a priest's daughter is a widow or divorced, without children, and returns to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food. But no outsider may eat of it.
3:22:14/If anyone eats the sacred offering by mistake, they must add a fifth of its value to it and give it to the priest with the sacred offering.
3:22:15/They must not desecrate the sacred offerings of the Israelites, which they present to the LORD,
3:22:16/Or allow them to bear the guilt of trespass when they eat their sacred offerings: for I the LORD sanctify them.
3:22:17/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:22:18/Tell Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, that anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners in Israel who presents their offering, whether they are fulfilling a vow or making a freewill offering that they present to the LORD as a burnt offering,
3:22:19/Must offer a male without defect from the cattle, sheep, or goats to be accepted.
3:22:20/You must not offer anything that has a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
3:22:21/Anyone who offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a vow, or as a freewill offering from the cattle or sheep, it must be perfect to be accepted; there must be no defect in it.
3:22:22/You must not offer to the LORD any animal that is blind, injured, mutilated, or has a wart, skin disease, or scabs. You must not place any of these on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3:22:23/You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part too long or too short as a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted.
3:22:24/You must not offer to the LORD any animal that is bruised, crushed, torn, or cut; you must not make any such offering in your land.
3:22:25/And you must not accept such offerings from the hand of a foreigner to offer as the food of your God. Because their corruption is in them, they have defects; they will not be accepted on your behalf.
3:22:26/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:22:27/When a calf, lamb, or goat is born, it must stay seven days with its mother; from the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3:22:28/Whether it is a cow or ewe, do not kill both it and its young on the same day.
3:22:29/When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it so that it may be accepted.
3:22:30/It must be eaten on the same day; leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
3:22:31/Therefore, you must keep my commands and carry them out: I am the LORD.
3:22:32/You must not desecrate my holy name, but I will be recognized as holy among the Israelites: I am the LORD who makes you holy,
3:22:33/Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD.
3:23:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:2/Tell the Israelites about the festivals of the LORD, which you are to declare as sacred gatherings; these are my appointed festivals.
3:23:3/You may work for six days, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, a sacred assembly. You must not do any work on it; it is a Sabbath to the LORD wherever you live.
3:23:4/These are the LORD's appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
3:23:5/On the fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, is the LORD's Passover.
3:23:6/And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Festival of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast.
3:23:7/On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
3:23:8/For seven days present a food offering to the LORD. On the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
3:23:9/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:10/Tell the Israelites, when you enter the land I am giving you and harvest its crops, bring the first sheaf of your harvest to the priest.
3:23:11/He is to wave the sheaf before the LORD so it will be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
3:23:12/On the day you wave the sheaf, you must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the LORD a lamb a year old without defect.
3:23:13/Its grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD for a pleasing aroma; and its drink offering shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.
3:23:14/You must not eat any bread, or roasted or new grain, until the very day you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.
3:23:15/From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks.
3:23:16/Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
3:23:17/From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the LORD.
3:23:18/Along with the bread, present seven year-old lambs without defect, one young bull, and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the LORD, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
3:23:19/Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs, each a year old, for a fellowship offering.
3:23:20/The priest is to wave them, together with the bread of the firstfruits, as a wave offering before the LORD; they are sacred to the LORD for the priest.
3:23:21/On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.
3:23:22/When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the foreigner residing among you. I am the LORD your God.
3:23:23/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:24/Tell the Israelites, on the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of Sabbath rest, a memorial with trumpet blasts, a sacred assembly.
3:23:25/Do no regular work, but present a food offering to the LORD.
3:23:26/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:27/Also on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be a sacred assembly for you; you must deny yourselves and present a food offering to the LORD.
3:23:28/Do no work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the LORD your God.
3:23:29/Anyone who does not deny themselves on that day must be cut off from their people.
3:23:30/And anyone who does any work on that day, I will destroy from among their people.
3:23:31/Do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.
3:23:32/It is a day of Sabbath rest for you, and you must deny yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening, you are to observe your Sabbath.
3:23:33/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:34/Tell the Israelites, 'The fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.
3:23:35/On the first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work.
3:23:36/For seven days present food offerings to the LORD, and on the eighth day hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the LORD. It is a solemn gathering; do no regular work.
3:23:37/These are the LORD's appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for presenting food offerings to the LORD—the burnt offerings, grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day.
3:23:38/These offerings are in addition to the LORD's Sabbaths and in addition to your gifts and whatever you have vowed and all the freewill offerings you give to the LORD.
3:23:39/So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the LORD for seven days; the first day is a day of Sabbath rest, and the eighth day also is a day of Sabbath rest.
3:23:40/On the first day you are to take branches from luxuriant trees—from palms, willows and other leafy trees—and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
3:23:41/Celebrate this as a festival to the LORD for seven days each year. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month.
3:23:42/Live in temporary shelters for seven days: All native-born Israelites are to live in such shelters
3:23:43/so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
3:23:44/And Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the LORD.
3:24:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:24:2/Tell the children of Israel to bring you pure, beaten olive oil for the light, to keep the lamps burning continuously.
3:24:3/Outside the curtain of the testimony, in the meeting tent, Aaron must arrange it from evening until morning before the LORD continuously: it is to be a perpetual ordinance for all your generations.
3:24:4/He must keep the lamps on the pure lampstand before the LORD continuously.
3:24:5/You must take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it: each loaf should contain two-tenths of an ephah.
3:24:6/You must place them in two rows, six in each row, on the pure table before the LORD.
3:24:7/And you must place pure frankincense on each row, to serve as a reminder, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3:24:8/Every Sabbath he must arrange them before the LORD continuously, taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
3:24:9/It will belong to Aaron and his sons, and they are to eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him from the LORD's offerings made by fire, a perpetual statute.
3:24:10/And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel fought in the camp;
3:24:11/And the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses: (his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
3:24:12/And they detained him, so that the will of the LORD could be made clear to them.
3:24:13/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:24:14/Take the one who cursed outside the camp; and let everyone who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let the entire community stone him.
3:24:15/And you must tell the children of Israel, 'Anyone who curses their God will bear their sin.'
3:24:16/And anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death, and the whole community must certainly stone them: both the foreigner and the native-born, when they blaspheme the Name, must be put to death.
3:24:17/Anyone who kills a person must surely be put to death.
3:24:18/Anyone who kills an animal must make restitution for it, life for life.
3:24:19/If anyone injures their neighbor, whatever they have done must be done to them:
3:24:20/Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever injury they have caused another person must be inflicted on them.
3:24:21/And anyone who kills an animal must make restitution for it, but anyone who kills a person must be put to death.
3:24:22/You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the LORD your God.
3:24:23/And Moses told the children of Israel to take the one who had cursed outside the camp and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
3:25:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
3:25:2/Tell the Israelites, when you enter the land I am giving you, the land must observe a Sabbath to the LORD.
3:25:3/For six years you may sow your fields, and for six years you may prune your vineyard and gather its fruits.
3:25:4/But the seventh year will be a Sabbath of rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD: you must not sow your fields or prune your vineyard.
3:25:5/You must not harvest what grows of its own accord or gather the grapes from your unpruned vines, because it is a year of rest for the land.
3:25:6/The produce of the land during its Sabbath will provide food for you, your male and female servants, your hired workers, and the temporary residents who live with you.
3:25:7/This produce will also feed your livestock and the wild animals in your land.
3:25:8/You must count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, so that the seven Sabbaths of years amount to forty-nine years.
3:25:9/Then you must sound the trumpet loudly on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, you will sound the trumpet throughout your entire land.
3:25:10/You must consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom throughout the land for all its inhabitants. It will be a Jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your property and your family.
3:25:11/That fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you; do not sow, do not reap what grows of itself, nor gather the grapes from the unpruned vines.
3:25:12/For it is a Jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
3:25:13/In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.
3:25:14/If you sell something to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you must not take advantage of each other.
3:25:15/When you buy from your neighbor, you should do so based on the number of years since the Jubilee. And when you sell to your neighbor, you should base your price on the number of remaining crop years.
3:25:16/If the years are many, you should increase the price, and if the years are few, you should decrease the price, because what is being sold to you is the number of crops.
3:25:17/Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God; for I am the LORD your God.
3:25:18/Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.
3:25:19/Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.
3:25:20/If you wonder, 'What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?'
3:25:21/I will send such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
3:25:22/While you plant in the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop until the ninth year; until its crops come in, you will eat the old food.
3:25:23/The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers.
3:25:24/Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
3:25:25/If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what their fellow Israelite has sold.
3:25:26/If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves,
3:25:27/they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property.
3:25:28/But if they do not acquire the means to repay what was sold, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then return to their property.
3:25:29/If anyone sells a residential house in a walled city, they have a year to redeem it; within a full year they may redeem it.
3:25:30/If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer's descendants; it is not to be returned in the Jubilee.
3:25:31/However, houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
3:25:32/As for the Levites, they may redeem at any time the houses in the cities of their possession.
3:25:33/If a Levite redeems a house in the city of their possession, then the house that was sold in the city of their possession will be returned in the Jubilee, for the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites.
3:25:34/But the pastureland belonging to their cities must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
3:25:35/If your fellow Israelite becomes poor and is unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident, so they can continue to live among you.
3:25:36/Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that your fellow Israelite may continue to live among you.
3:25:37/You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.
3:25:38/I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
3:25:39/If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves.
3:25:40/They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
3:25:41/Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors.
3:25:42/Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.
3:25:43/Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.
3:25:44/Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves.
3:25:45/You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.
3:25:46/You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
3:25:47/If a foreigner or temporary resident among you becomes rich and your fellow Israelite becomes poor and sells themselves to the foreigner living among you or to a member of the foreigner's clan,
3:25:48/after they sell themselves, they may be redeemed. One of their relatives may redeem them:
3:25:49/An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves.
3:25:50/They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price of their release is to be based on the rate for hired workers for that number of years.
3:25:51/If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them.
3:25:52/If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly.
3:25:53/They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those who buy them do not rule over them ruthlessly.
3:25:54/Even if someone is not redeemed in these years, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,
3:25:55/for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
3:26:1/Do not make any idols or carved images for yourselves, nor set up any sculpted stone in your land to worship it: for I am the LORD your God.
3:26:2/Observe my Sabbaths and show deep respect for my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
3:26:3/If you follow my decrees, obey my commands, and put them into action;
3:26:4/Then I will send you rain at the right time, and the land will produce its crops, and the trees of the field will bear fruit.
3:26:5/Your harvesting will continue until grape picking, and grape picking will continue until planting time; you will have plenty of bread to eat and will live securely in your land.
3:26:6/I will grant peace in the land, and you will rest without fear; I will eliminate dangerous animals and prevent war from entering your land.
3:26:7/You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.
3:26:8/Just five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.
3:26:9/I will look favorably upon you, make you fruitful, increase your numbers, and uphold my covenant with you.
3:26:10/You will eat from the surplus of your previous harvest and need to clear out the old to make room for the new.
3:26:11/I will place my dwelling among you, and I will not reject you.
3:26:12/I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.
3:26:13/I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt so you would no longer be their slaves; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high.
3:26:14/But if you do not listen to me and do not carry out all these commands;
3:26:15/And if you reject my decrees, and if your soul despises my laws, failing to carry out all my commands and breaking my covenant;
3:26:16/Then I will do this to you: I will bring terror, wasting diseases, and fever that will blind your eyes and sap your strength. You will plant your seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it.
3:26:17/I will set my face against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
3:26:18/And if after all this you do not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over.
3:26:19/I will break the pride of your power; I will make your sky like iron and your ground like bronze.
3:26:20/Your strength will be spent in vain, because your land will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of the land produce their fruit.
3:26:21/If you continue to oppose me and refuse to listen to me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins.
3:26:22/I will send wild animals to rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your numbers until your roads are deserted.
3:26:23/And if you do not reform your ways in response to these things but continue to oppose me;
3:26:24/Then I too will oppose you, and I will punish you again seven times for your sins.
3:26:25/I will bring a sword against you to enforce the terms of my covenant. When you gather in your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be handed over to the enemy.
3:26:26/When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will ration your bread by weight; you will eat but not be satisfied.
3:26:27/And if in spite of this you do not listen to me but continue to oppose me;
3:26:28/Then I will act against you in wrathful opposition; I myself will punish you seven times for your sins.
3:26:29/You will eat the flesh of your sons and daughters.
3:26:30/I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and pile your remains on the remains of your idols, and my soul will detest you.
3:26:31/I will lay waste to your cities and make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not savor the fragrance of your sweet aromas.
3:26:32/I will turn the land into a desolation; your enemies who settle in it will be appalled by it.
3:26:33/I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out a sword after you; your land will become desolate and your cities will be in ruins.
3:26:34/Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies' land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
3:26:35/As long as it lies desolate, it will have the rest it did not have during your sabbaths when you lived on it.
3:26:36/As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight; they will run as though fleeing from the sword and fall, even though no one is pursuing them.
3:26:37/They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your enemies.
3:26:38/You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will consume you.
3:26:39/Those of you who are left will waste away in your enemies' lands because of their sins; also because of their ancestors' sins, they will waste away with them.
3:26:40/But if they confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors—their unfaithfulness and their opposition to me,
3:26:41/Which made me oppose them and send them into the land of their enemies—then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin,
3:26:42/I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
3:26:43/The land will be abandoned by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; they will pay for their sins because they rejected my decrees and abhorred my laws.
3:26:44/Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the LORD their God.
3:26:45/But for their sake, I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the LORD.
3:26:46/These are the decrees, laws, and regulations that the LORD established between himself and the Israelites at Mount Sinai through Moses.
3:27:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:27:2/Tell the Israelites, when someone makes a special vow, the people shall belong to the LORD, valued as you determine.
3:27:3/Your valuation for a male between twenty and sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel.
3:27:4/If it's a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
3:27:5/For someone five to twenty years old, your valuation shall be twenty shekels for a male and ten shekels for a female.
3:27:6/For a child one month to five years old, your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for a male and three shekels for a female.
3:27:7/For anyone sixty years old or older, your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for a male and ten shekels for a female.
3:27:8/But if someone is too poor for your valuation, they shall present themselves to the priest, who will set a value according to what the person can afford.
3:27:9/If it's an animal that can be offered to the LORD, anything given to the LORD becomes holy.
3:27:10/It must not be exchanged or replaced, whether good for bad or bad for good. If anyone does exchange one animal for another, both the original and the replacement become holy.
3:27:11/If it's an unclean animal that cannot be offered to the LORD, it must be presented to the priest.
3:27:12/The priest will set its value, whether high or low. As the priest values it, so it will be.
3:27:13/If the owner wishes to buy it back, they must add a fifth to your valuation.
3:27:14/When someone dedicates their house as holy to the LORD, the priest will determine its value, whether high or low. As the priest values it, so it will stand.
3:27:15/If the person dedicating it wants to buy it back, they must add a fifth to your valuation, and it will be theirs again.
3:27:16/If someone dedicates part of their land to the LORD, your valuation will be based on its seed requirement: fifty shekels of silver for an homer of barley seed.
3:27:17/If they dedicate their field from the Year of Jubilee, it will be valued as you determine.
3:27:18/But if they dedicate their field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the price based on the years remaining until the next Jubilee, and it will be reduced from your valuation.
3:27:19/If the one who dedicated the field decides to buy it back, they must add a fifth to your valuation, and it will be confirmed to them.
3:27:20/If they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold the field to someone else, it cannot be redeemed anymore.
3:27:21/But when the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy to the LORD, like a field devoted; it will belong to the priest.
3:27:22/If someone dedicates to the LORD a field they have bought, which is not part of their ancestral property,
3:27:23/The priest will calculate its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and on that day, they will pay the valuation as something holy to the LORD.
3:27:24/In the Year of Jubilee, the field will return to the person from whom it was bought, the original owner of the land.
3:27:25/All your valuations shall be according to the sanctuary shekel: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
3:27:26/Only the firstborn of animals, which are already the LORD's as firstborn, no one may dedicate; whether an ox or a sheep, it belongs to the LORD.
3:27:27/If it's an unclean animal, then it can be redeemed at your valuation plus a fifth. If it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold at your valuation.
3:27:28/However, no devoted thing that someone devotes to the LORD, whether human, animal, or field of their possession, can be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
3:27:29/No person devoted to destruction can be ransomed; they must be put to death.
3:27:30/All the tithe of the land, whether from the seeds of the land or the fruit of the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.
3:27:31/If anyone wishes to redeem any of their tithe, they must add a fifth to it.
3:27:32/Regarding the tithe of the herd or flock, every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd's rod will be holy to the LORD.
3:27:33/They must not inspect whether it is good or bad, nor can they substitute it. If they do substitute it, both the original and the substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.
3:27:34/These are the commandments the LORD gave Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
4:1:1/The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the meeting tent, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had left Egypt, saying,
4:1:2/"Count all the members of the entire community of Israel by their families and ancestral houses, listing every man by name, one by one.
4:1:3/From the age of twenty years and older, all who are fit for military service in Israel: you and Aaron are to register them by their divisions.
4:1:4/You must have one representative from each tribe, each one the head of his family.

4:1:18/And they gathered the entire assembly together on the first day of the second month. They registered the people by their families, by their ancestral houses, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, individually.
4:1:19/As the LORD had commanded Moses, so he counted them in the wilderness of Sinai.

4:1:46/The total number counted was six hundred three thousand five hundred and fifty.
4:1:47/But the Levites, according to the tribe of their fathers, were not counted among them.

4:1:50/But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the covenant, all its furnishings, and everything that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, serve in it, and encamp around it.
4:1:51/When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and when it is to be set up, the Levites shall erect it. Any unauthorized person who comes near it must be put to death.
4:1:52/The Israelites will camp each by his own standard, with the banners of their families, around the tent of meeting at a distance.

4:1:54/The children of Israel did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:2:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:2:2/Every Israelite must camp under their own flag, with the symbols of their ancestors' families: they must camp some distance around the Tent of Meeting.
4:2:3/On the east side, towards the sunrise, the camp of Judah shall set up under their standard, with Nahshon son of Amminadab as the leader of the people of Judah.
4:2:4/Their army, with those counted, totaled seventy-four thousand six hundred.

4:2:33/But the Levites were not counted among the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:2:34/The Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses: they camped by their flags and moved out each according to their families, by their ancestral houses.
4:3:1/These are the family records of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
4:3:2/Here are the names of Aaron's sons: Nadab the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
4:3:3/These are the names of Aaron's sons, the priests who were anointed and set apart to serve as priests.
4:3:4/Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests under the supervision of Aaron their father.
4:3:5/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:3:6/Bring the tribe of Levi close and present them before Aaron the priest so they can assist him.
4:3:7/They are to take care of his responsibilities and the responsibilities of the whole community before the Tent of Meeting by performing the duties of the tabernacle.
4:3:8/They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by performing the duties of the tabernacle.
4:3:9/You are to assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are entirely given to him from among the Israelites.
4:3:10/You shall appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. Anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death.
4:3:11/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:3:12/I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of every firstborn who opens the womb among the Israelites. Therefore, the Levites are mine;
4:3:13/Because every firstborn is mine. On the day I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They are to be mine. I am the LORD.
4:3:14/And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
4:3:15/Count the Levites by their ancestral houses and by families. Every male a month old or more you must count.
4:3:16/And Moses counted them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.
4:3:17/These were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
4:3:18/These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
4:3:19/And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
4:3:20/And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their ancestral houses.
4:3:21/From Gershon came the Libnite and Shimeite families; these were the Gershonite families.
4:3:22/Those counted of them, according to the number of all the males a month old or more, were seven thousand five hundred.
4:3:23/The Gershonite families are to camp behind the tabernacle to the west.
4:3:24/And the leader of the ancestral house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph son of Lael.
4:3:25/The responsibilities of the Gershonite sons in the Tent of Meeting include the tabernacle, the tent, its covering, the curtain for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
4:3:26/And the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and their ropes—all the work related to these.
4:3:27/From Kohath came the Amramite, Izeharite, Hebronite, and Uzzielite families; these were the Kohathite families.
4:3:28/Counting all the males a month old or more, there were eight thousand six hundred responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
4:3:29/The families of the sons of Kohath are to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
4:3:30/And the leader of the ancestral house of the Kohathite families shall be Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
4:3:31/Their duties include the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the sacred vessels they use to minister, the curtain, and all the service related to these.
4:3:32/Eleazar son of Aaron the priest is to be chief over the leaders of the Levites, with oversight of those who keep the charge of the sanctuary.
4:3:33/From Merari came the Mahlite and Mushite families; these were the Merarite families.
4:3:34/Those counted of them, according to the number of all the males a month old or more, were six thousand two hundred.
4:3:35/And the leader of the ancestral house of the families of Merari was Zuriel son of Abihail. They are to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
4:3:36/Under the care and responsibility of the sons of Merari shall be the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,
4:3:37/As well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard, their bases, pegs, and ropes.
4:3:38/But those who camp in front of the tabernacle on the east, in front of the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise, are Moses, Aaron, and his sons, maintaining the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approaches must be put to death.
4:3:39/All the Levites whom Moses and Aaron counted at the command of the LORD, by their families, all the males a month old or more, were twenty-two thousand.
4:3:40/And the LORD said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn males of the Israelites from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
4:3:41/You are to take the Levites for me—I am the LORD—in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the livestock of the Israelites."
4:3:42/And Moses counted, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the Israelites.
4:3:43/And all the firstborn males by the number of names from a month old and upward, of those counted, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.
4:3:44/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:3:45/"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites shall be mine. I am the LORD.
4:3:46/And for the redemption of the two hundred and seventy-three of the firstborn of the Israelites, who exceed the number of the Levites,
4:3:47/You shall take five shekels per head; you shall take them according to the sanctuary shekel (twenty gerahs to the shekel).
4:3:48/And you shall give the money with which the excess number of them is redeemed to Aaron and his sons."
4:3:49/And Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites.
4:3:50/From the firstborn of the Israelites he took the money, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
4:3:51/And Moses gave the money from those redeemed to Aaron and his sons, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:4:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:4:2/Count the descendants of Kohath from among the Levites, by their families and ancestral houses,
4:4:3/From thirty years old up to fifty years old, all who are fit to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
4:4:4/This is the duty of the Kohathites in the tent of meeting, concerning the most sacred objects:
4:4:5/When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons must come and take down the curtain of the sanctuary and cover the ark of the covenant with it.
4:4:6/Then they must place on it a covering of fine leather and spread a cloth of pure blue over that, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:7/On the table of the Presence, they must spread a blue cloth and place on it the plates, ladles, bowls, and jars for pouring; and the bread of the Presence must remain on it.
4:4:8/They must spread a scarlet cloth over them and cover that with a fine leather covering, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:9/They must take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for lighting, its lamps, lamp snuffers, trays, and all the oil vessels used with it.
4:4:10/They must place it and all its accessories inside a covering of fine leather and put it on a carrying frame.
4:4:11/On the gold altar, they must spread a blue cloth and cover it with a fine leather covering, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:12/They must take all the utensils used in the sanctuary service, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with a fine leather covering, and place them on a carrying frame.
4:4:13/They must remove the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
4:4:14/They must place on it all the utensils used for tending the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and basins, and cover them with a fine leather covering, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:15/After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the sacred furnishings as the camp is about to move, the Kohathites are to come to carry them, but they must not touch the sacred objects or they will die. These are the responsibilities of the Kohathites with regard to the tent of meeting.
4:4:16/Eleazar son of Aaron the priest is to oversee the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering, the anointing oil, the oversight of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including the sanctuary and its furnishings.
4:4:17/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:4:18/Do not cut off the tribe of the Kohathites from among the Levites.
4:4:19/But deal with them in such a way that they may live and not die when they approach the most sacred objects. Aaron and his sons are to go in and assign each man his task and his carrying load.
4:4:20/But they must not go in to look at the sacred objects even for a moment, or they will die.
4:4:21/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:4:22/Also count the descendants of Gershon, by their families and ancestral houses;
4:4:23/From thirty years old up to fifty years old, count them; all who enter to perform the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
4:4:24/This is the service of the Gershonite clans in serving and carrying burdens:
4:4:25/They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, its covering, and the fine leather covering that is over it, the curtains for the entrance of the tent of meeting,
4:4:26/The hangings of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance of the gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, their ropes, and all the equipment related to their use. They are to perform all these services.
4:4:27/Everything that is to be done with these items, Aaron and his sons are to direct the Gershonites in all their tasks and responsibilities.
4:4:28/This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting, and their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
4:4:29/As for the sons of Merari, you are to record them by their clans and families;
4:4:30/Count them from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who enters the service to work at the tent of meeting.
4:4:31/This is their duty in their service at the tent of meeting: to carry the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases,
4:4:32/And the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, pegs, ropes, and all their equipment and service. You are to list by name the items they are responsible for carrying.
4:4:33/This is the service of the Merarite clans in their duties at the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
4:4:34/Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families,
4:4:35/From thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
4:4:36/And those counted by their clans were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
4:4:37/These were the ones counted from the Kohathite clans, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the LORD's command through Moses.
4:4:38/The Gershonites were counted by their clans and families,
4:4:39/From thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting,
4:4:40/And those counted by their clans and families were two thousand six hundred and thirty.
4:4:41/These were the ones counted from the Gershonite clans, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the LORD's command.
4:4:42/The families of the sons of Merari were counted by their clans and families,
4:4:43/From thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting,
4:4:44/And those counted by their clans were three thousand and two hundred.
4:4:45/These were the ones counted from the Merarite clans, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the LORD's command through Moses.
4:4:46/All the Levites whom Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted by their clans and families,
4:4:47/From thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who came to do the service of ministry and the service of carrying in the tent of meeting,
4:4:48/Were eight thousand five hundred and eighty,
4:4:49/According to the LORD's command, they were counted by Moses, each according to his service and his burden. Thus, they were counted by him, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:5:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:5:2/Tell the Israelites to send out of the camp anyone with leprosy, anyone who has a discharge, and anyone who is unclean because of a dead body.
4:5:3/Both men and women must be sent out; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.
4:5:4/And the Israelites did so, sending them outside the camp. Just as the LORD had instructed Moses, so the Israelites did.
4:5:5/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:5:6/Tell the Israelites, when a man or woman commits any sin that people commit, by breaking faith with the LORD, and that person is guilty,
4:5:7/They must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution for their wrong, add one-fifth to it, and give it to the one they have wronged.
4:5:8/But if the person has no relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong must go to the LORD for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement by which atonement is made for the person.
4:5:9/Every contribution from all the holy things of the Israelites, which they bring to the priest, shall belong to him.
4:5:10/And each person's sacred donations shall be theirs. Whatever anyone gives to the priest shall belong to him.
4:5:11/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:5:12/Tell the Israelites, if any man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,
4:5:13/And another man has sexual relations with her, and it is hidden from her husband's eyes, and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, nor was she caught in the act,
4:5:14/And if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife, whether she is defiled or not,
4:5:15/Then the man must bring his wife to the priest. He must also bring an offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He must not pour oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, bringing sin to mind.
4:5:16/And the priest shall bring her forward and have her stand before the LORD.
4:5:17/And the priest shall take holy water in a clay jar; and taking dust from the floor of the tabernacle, the priest shall put it into the water.
4:5:18/Then the priest shall have the woman stand before the LORD, uncover the woman's head, and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the jealousy offering. The priest shall hold in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse.
4:5:19/And the priest shall put her under oath and say to the woman, "If no man has slept with you and if you have not gone astray and become unclean while married to your husband, be immune to this bitter water that brings a curse.
4:5:20/But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have become unclean because a man other than your husband has had sexual relations with you,"
4:5:21/Then the priest shall put the woman under the curse of the oath, and the priest shall say to the woman, "May the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people when the LORD causes your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell.
4:5:22/And this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, making your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away." And the woman shall say, "Amen, amen."
4:5:23/And the priest shall write these curses in a document and then wash them off into the bitter water.
4:5:24/He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings a curse shall enter her to become bitter.
4:5:25/Then the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, wave the offering before the LORD, and bring it to the altar.
4:5:26/And the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Afterward, he shall make the woman drink the water.
4:5:27/When he has made her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering; her abdomen will swell, and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people.
4:5:28/But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will be free and able to conceive children.
4:5:29/This is the law of jealousy when a wife, while under her husband's authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
4:5:30/Or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The man is to have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest is to carry out all this law on her.
4:5:31/The man will be free from guilt, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.
4:6:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:6:2/Tell the Israelites, when any man or woman decides to make a special vow as a Nazarite, dedicating themselves to the LORD,
4:6:3/They must abstain from wine and other alcoholic drinks. They must not drink vinegar made from wine or from other alcoholic drinks, nor drink grape juice, nor eat fresh or dried grapes.
4:6:4/Throughout the period of their vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.
4:6:5/For the entire time of their vow, no razor may be used on their head. They must remain holy until the period of their dedication to the LORD is over; they must let their hair grow long.
4:6:6/Throughout the period of dedication to the LORD, they must not go near a dead body.
4:6:7/They must not make themselves ceremonially unclean for their father, mother, brother, or sister when they die, because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head.
4:6:8/For the whole period of their vow, they are holy to the LORD.
4:6:9/If someone dies suddenly in their presence, thus defiling their dedicated head, they must shave their head on the day of their cleansing—the seventh day.
4:6:10/On the eighth day, they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
4:6:11/The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for them because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to reconsecrate their head,
4:6:12/They must rededicate themselves to the LORD for the same period of dedication and bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous period of dedication will not count because they became defiled.
4:6:13/This is the law of the Nazarite when the period of their dedication is over: They are to be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4:6:14/There they are to present their offerings to the LORD: a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering,
4:6:15/along with a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, together with their grain and drink offerings.
4:6:16/The priest is to present them before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.
4:6:17/He is to present the ram as a fellowship offering to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall also make the grain offering and the drink offering.
4:6:18/Then the Nazarite is to shave their dedicated head at the entrance to the tent of meeting, take the hair, and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering.
4:6:19/After the Nazarite has shaved off the hair of their dedication, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake and one unleavened wafer from the basket.
4:6:20/The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazarite may drink wine.
4:6:21/This is the law of the Nazarite who vows their offering to the LORD in accordance with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must fulfill the vow they have made, according to the law of the Nazarite.
4:6:22/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:6:23/Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them,
4:6:24/May the LORD bless you and protect you.
4:6:25/May the LORD make his face shine on you and be gracious to you.
4:6:26/May the LORD look upon you with favor and give you peace.'
4:6:27/So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.
4:7:1/On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, anointing and consecrating it, along with all its furnishings, the altar, and all its vessels, anointing and consecrating them as well;
4:7:2/The leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses, who were also leaders of the tribes and in charge of those who were counted, made an offering.
4:7:3/They presented their offering before the LORD: six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two leaders, and an ox each. They brought them in front of the tabernacle.
4:7:4/Then the LORD said to Moses,
4:7:5/"Accept these from them, so they may be used in the service of the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites, each according to his service."
4:7:6/Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
4:7:7/He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their service required;
4:7:8/And he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their service required, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
4:7:9/But to the Kohathites he gave none, because their service involved carrying the sacred objects on their shoulders.
4:7:10/The leaders also brought offerings for the dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed. The leaders presented their offerings before the altar.
4:7:11/And the LORD said to Moses, "Each leader is to present his offering one leader per day for the dedication of the altar."

4:7:89/When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the Ark of the Covenant, between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.
4:8:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:8:2/Tell Aaron that when he lights the lamps, the seven lamps should illuminate the area in front of the lampstand.
4:8:3/And Aaron did exactly that; he lit the lamps so they shone in front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
4:8:4/The lampstand was made of hammered gold, from its base to its flowers, it was all crafted from hammered work: according to the design that the LORD had shown Moses, that's how he made the lampstand.
4:8:5/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:8:6/Select the Levites from among the Israelites, and purify them.
4:8:7/To purify them, do this: Sprinkle purifying water on them, have them shave all their body hair, and wash their clothes. Then they will be clean.
4:8:8/Next, they should take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you must take another young bull for a sin offering.
4:8:9/Bring the Levites in front of the Tent of Meeting and gather the entire Israelite community.
4:8:10/Bring the Levites before the LORD, and the Israelites shall lay their hands on the Levites.
4:8:11/Aaron will present the Levites before the LORD as an offering from the Israelites, so they may perform the service of the LORD.
4:8:12/The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls: you are to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.
4:8:13/Place the Levites before Aaron and his sons and present them as an offering to the LORD.
4:8:14/In this way, you will set apart the Levites from among the Israelites, and the Levites will be mine.
4:8:15/Afterward, the Levites may enter to serve at the Tent of Meeting. You must purify them and present them as an offering.
4:8:16/For they are wholly given to me from among the Israelites; in place of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the Israelites, I have taken them for myself.
4:8:17/For all the firstborn among the Israelites are mine, both human and animal. On the day I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.
4:8:18/And I have chosen the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites.
4:8:19/I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to perform the service for the Israelites in the Tent of Meeting and to make atonement for the Israelites, so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they come near the sanctuary.
4:8:20/And Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community did with the Levites just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
4:8:21/The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as an offering before the LORD and made atonement for them to purify them.
4:8:22/After that, the Levites went in to perform their service in the Tent of Meeting under Aaron and his sons' supervision, just as the LORD had instructed Moses regarding the Levites.
4:8:23/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:8:24/This applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to serve in the Tent of Meeting.
4:8:25/But at the age of fifty, they must retire from their service and not serve anymore.
4:8:26/However, they may assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting by keeping watch, but they shall not perform the service. This is how you are to assign duties to the Levites.
4:9:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had left Egypt, saying,
4:9:2/Instruct the children of Israel to observe the Passover at its scheduled time.
4:9:3/On the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, you shall celebrate it at its scheduled time: you must follow all its rituals and ceremonies.
4:9:4/And Moses told the children of Israel that they should observe the Passover.
4:9:5/So they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at dusk in the wilderness of Sinai: just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
4:9:6/However, there were some men who were impure because of a human corpse, so they could not observe the Passover on that day; and they presented themselves before Moses and Aaron on that day.
4:9:7/And these men said to him, "We are impure because of a human corpse. Why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD's offering at its appointed time among the children of Israel?"
4:9:8/And Moses replied to them, "Wait here, and I will find out what the LORD commands concerning you."
4:9:9/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:9:10/Tell the children of Israel, 'If anyone among you or your descendants is unclean because of a corpse, or is on a distant journey, he must still observe the Passover for the LORD.
4:9:11/They must observe it on the fourteenth day of the second month at dusk, eating it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
4:9:12/They must not leave any of it until morning, nor break any of its bones; they must follow all the regulations for the Passover.
4:9:13/But if a person is clean and not on a journey, yet fails to observe the Passover, that individual will be cut off from his people because he did not present the LORD's offering at the appointed time; that person will bear the consequences of his sin.
4:9:14/And if a foreigner resides among you and wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he must do so according to the Passover's regulations and customs. You shall have the same law for both the foreigner and the native-born.
4:9:15/On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered it, the tent of the covenant; and in the evening it looked like fire over the tabernacle until morning.
4:9:16/This was always the case: the cloud covered it by day, and it appeared like fire by night.
4:9:17/Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites would set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites would encamp.
4:9:18/At the LORD's command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
4:9:19/When the cloud remained over the tabernacle for a long time, the Israelites obeyed the LORD's order and did not set out.
4:9:20/Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle for only a few days; at the LORD's command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out.
4:9:21/Sometimes the cloud stayed from evening until morning; when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.
4:9:22/Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.
4:9:23/At the LORD's command they encamped, and at the LORD's command they set out. They followed the LORD's orders, according to his command through Moses.
4:10:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:10:2/Make two trumpets out of silver; you shall make them from a single piece: so you can use them to call the assembly together and to signal the moving of the camps.
4:10:3/When they are blown, the entire assembly shall gather to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4:10:4/If only one trumpet is blown, then the leaders, who are the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather to you.
4:10:5/When you sound a blast, the camps on the east side shall set out.
4:10:6/When you sound a blast for the second time, the camps on the south side shall begin their journey: sound a blast for their departure.
4:10:7/But when the assembly is to be gathered, you shall blow the trumpets without sounding an alarm.
4:10:8/The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets; this shall be a perpetual ordinance for you and your descendants.
4:10:9/If you go to war in your land against an aggressor, you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; then you will be remembered before the LORD your God and saved from your enemies.
4:10:10/Also on your days of celebration, during your festivals, and at the start of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; they shall serve as a reminder of you before your God: I am the LORD your God.
4:10:11/On the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant.
4:10:12/The Israelites set out from the Sinai wilderness, and the cloud settled in the Paran wilderness.
4:10:13/They began their journey at the LORD's command through Moses.
4:10:14/The division of the camp of Judah set out first, according to their ranks, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.
4:10:15/Over the division of the tribe of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar.
4:10:16/And over the division of the tribe of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon.
4:10:17/The tabernacle was dismantled, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out.
4:10:18/The division of the camp of Reuben set out according to their ranks, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.
4:10:19/Over the division of the tribe of Simeon was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
4:10:20/And over the division of the tribe of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel.
4:10:21/The Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
4:10:22/The division of the camp of Ephraim set out according to their ranks, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command.

4:10:24/And over the division of the tribe of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni.

4:10:26/Over the division of the tribe of Asher was Pagiel son of Ocran.
4:10:27/And over the division of the tribe of Naphtali was Ahira son of Enan.
4:10:28/This is how the Israelites traveled by their divisions when they set out.
4:10:29/Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things for Israel."
4:10:30/But he replied, "I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my family."
4:10:31/Then Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our guide.
4:10:32/If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us."
4:10:33/They set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.
4:10:34/The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
4:10:35/Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, "Rise up, LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may those who hate you flee before you."
4:10:36/And when it came to rest, he said, "Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel."
4:11:1/When the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; his anger flared up, and the fire of the LORD burned among them, consuming those at the outskirts of the camp.
4:11:2/The people cried out to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was extinguished.
4:11:3/He named the place Taberah because the fire of the LORD had burned among them.
4:11:4/The mixed crowd among them craved other food, and the Israelites also began to cry again, asking, "Who will give us meat to eat?"
4:11:5/We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost; also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
4:11:6/But now we've lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!
4:11:7/The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.
4:11:8/The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in handmills or crushed it in mortars. They cooked it in pots or made cakes with it. It tasted like something made with olive oil.
4:11:9/When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.
4:11:10/Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.
4:11:11/He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
4:11:12/Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, that you should tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors?
4:11:13/Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give us meat to eat!'
4:11:14/I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
4:11:15/If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin."
4:11:16/The LORD said to Moses, "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you.
4:11:17/I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.
4:11:18/Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.
4:11:19/You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,
4:11:20/but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'
4:11:21/But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'
4:11:22/Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"
4:11:23/The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you."
4:11:24/So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent.
4:11:25/Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again.
4:11:26/However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.
4:11:27/A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
4:11:28/Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them."
4:11:29/But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"
4:11:30/Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
4:11:31/Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits deep all around the camp, as far as a day's walk in any direction.
4:11:32/All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.
4:11:33/But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.
4:11:34/He named that place Kibroth Hattaavah because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
4:11:35/From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
4:12:1/And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman he had married, for he had indeed married an Ethiopian woman.
4:12:2/And they questioned, "Has the LORD truly spoken only through Moses? Hasn't He also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this.
4:12:3/(Moses was the most humble man on the face of the earth.)
4:12:4/Then the LORD suddenly said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting." And they did so.
4:12:5/And the LORD descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent, calling Aaron and Miriam, who both came forward.
4:12:6/He said, "Listen to my words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, will reveal myself to him in a vision and speak to him in a dream.
4:12:7/But my servant Moses is not like that; he is faithful in all my house.
4:12:8/With him, I speak directly, clearly, and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
4:12:9/And the LORD's anger burned against them, and He left.
4:12:10/And when the cloud lifted from above the tent, there was Miriam—leprous, as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy.
4:12:11/And Aaron said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have foolishly committed.
4:12:12/Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."
4:12:13/So Moses cried out to the LORD, "Please, God, heal her!"
4:12:14/But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had simply spit in her face, would she not be shamed for seven days? Let her be isolated outside the camp for seven days; after that, she can be brought back."
4:12:15/So Miriam was isolated outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought back.
4:12:16/Afterward, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
4:13:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:13:2/Send out men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites: from each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.
4:13:3/So Moses, following the LORD's command, sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were leaders of the Israelites.
4:13:4/And these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur.
4:13:5/From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori.
4:13:6/From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.
4:13:7/From the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph.
4:13:8/From the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea son of Nun.
4:13:9/From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu.
4:13:10/From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi.
4:13:11/From the tribe of Joseph, specifically from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi.
4:13:12/From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli.
4:13:13/From the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael.
4:13:14/From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi.
4:13:15/From the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi.
4:13:16/These are the names of the men Moses sent to scout out the land. And Moses renamed Oshea son of Nun to Joshua.
4:13:17/And Moses sent them to scout out the land of Canaan and told them, "Go up through the Negev and into the hill country.
4:13:18/And see what the land is like and the people who live there, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;
4:13:19/And what the land they live in is like, whether it is good or bad; and what kind of cities they live in, whether in camps or fortresses;
4:13:20/And what the land is like, whether it is fertile or poor, whether there are forests there or not. Be courageous, and bring back some of the fruit of the land." It was the season for the first ripe grapes.
4:13:21/So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin to Rehob, towards Lebo Hamath.
4:13:22/They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron; Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
4:13:23/They reached the Valley of Eshcol and cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two of them, along with some pomegranates and figs.
4:13:24/That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut down from there.
4:13:25/And they returned from exploring the land after forty days.
4:13:26/They came back to Moses, Aaron, and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. They reported to them and the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.
4:13:27/They reported to him, "We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
4:13:28/However, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. We also saw descendants of Anak there.
4:13:29/The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."
4:13:30/But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."
4:13:31/However, the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."
4:13:32/And they spread a negative report about the land they had explored to the Israelites, saying, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.
4:13:33/There we saw the giants, the descendants of Anak, who come from the giants. We felt like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."
4:14:1/And the entire congregation raised their voices, weeping loudly throughout the night.
4:14:2/And all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron, saying to them, "If only we had died in Egypt, or even here in the wilderness!
4:14:3/And why has the LORD brought us to this land, only for us to die by the sword, our wives and children to be taken as plunder? Wouldn't it have been better for us to go back to Egypt?"
4:14:4/So they said to each other, "Let's choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
4:14:5/Then Moses and Aaron fell face down in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.
4:14:6/Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who had explored the land, tore their clothes
4:14:7/and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is extremely fertile.
4:14:8/If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.
4:14:9/Just do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not fear them."
4:14:10/But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.
4:14:11/And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?
4:14:12/I will strike them with a plague and disinherit them, and I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."
4:14:13/But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.
4:14:14/And they will tell the residents of this land about it. They have already heard that you, LORD, are with these people and that you, LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
4:14:15/If you kill all these people as one man, then the nations who have heard this report about you will say,
4:14:16/'The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.'
4:14:17/Now may the LORD's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:
4:14:18/'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.'
4:14:19/Please forgive the sin of this people, in accordance with the greatness of your mercy, just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt until now."
4:14:20/Then the LORD said, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.
4:14:21/Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,
4:14:22/because all those men who have seen my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness yet have tested me these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,
4:14:23/they will certainly not see the land I swore to their ancestors, nor will any of those who rejected me see it.
4:14:24/But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.
4:14:25/(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys.) Tomorrow turn and set out toward the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."
4:14:26/Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
4:14:27/"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
4:14:28/So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say:
4:14:29/In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
4:14:30/Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4:14:31/As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.
4:14:32/But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
4:14:33/Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.
4:14:34/For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it means to have me against you.'
4:14:35/I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die."
4:14:36/So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it,
4:14:37/these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land died of a plague before the LORD.
4:14:38/But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, among those who had explored the land, remained alive.
4:14:39/When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
4:14:40/Early the next morning they went up toward the highlands, saying, "Here we are. We’ll go up to the place the LORD promised, for we have sinned."
4:14:41/But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD’s command? This will not succeed.
4:14:42/Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.
4:14:43/For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."
4:14:44/Yet they defiantly went up toward the highlands, even though neither the ark of the LORD’s covenant nor Moses left the camp.
4:14:45/Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, attacked them, and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
4:15:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:15:2/Tell the Israelites, when you enter the land you will live in, which I am giving to you,
4:15:3/And you present an offering by fire to the LORD, whether a burnt offering, a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, a voluntary offering, or during your sacred festivals, to create a pleasing aroma to the LORD from the cattle or the sheep:
4:15:4/Then the person offering their gift to the LORD must also bring a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil.
4:15:5/And you must prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for each lamb.
4:15:6/For a ram, you must prepare a grain offering of two tenths of an ephah of flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.
4:15:7/And as a drink offering, you must offer a third of a hin of wine, as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4:15:8/When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a fellowship offering to the LORD,
4:15:9/You must accompany the bull with a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of flour mixed with half a hin of oil.
4:15:10/And you must offer half a hin of wine as a drink offering, as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4:15:11/This is what you must do for each bull, ram, lamb, or goat.
4:15:12/Depending on the number you prepare, you must do the same for each one according to their number.
4:15:13/Everyone native to the country must do these things in this way when presenting an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4:15:14/And if a foreigner stays with you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and presents an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, they must do as you do.
4:15:15/The same rules apply to both you and the foreigner residing among you. This is a permanent ordinance for your generations: you and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD.
4:15:16/The same laws and regulations will apply to both you and the foreigner residing among you.
4:15:17/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:15:18/Tell the Israelites, when you enter the land I am bringing you to,
4:15:19/Then, when you eat from the bread of the land, you must present a contribution to the LORD.
4:15:20/You must offer up a loaf from the first of your dough as a contribution; just as you do with a contribution from the threshing floor, so shall you present it.
4:15:21/From the first of your dough, you must give to the LORD a contribution throughout your generations.
4:15:22/And if you fail to keep all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,
4:15:23/Everything that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day the LORD gave the commandments and onward through your generations,
4:15:24/Then, if something is done unintentionally without the knowledge of the community, the whole community must offer a young bull for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, along with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulations, and a male goat for a sin offering.
4:15:25/The priest will make atonement for the whole community of the Israelites, and they will be forgiven because it was unintentional. They must bring their offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD for their unintentional sin.
4:15:26/And the whole community of the Israelites and the foreigner residing among them will be forgiven, since all the people were involved in the unintentional sin.
4:15:27/If any individual sins unintentionally, they must bring a female goat in its first year as a sin offering.
4:15:28/The priest will make atonement before the LORD for the person who errs unintentionally, making atonement for them so they will be forgiven.
4:15:29/There will be one law for anyone who sins unintentionally, whether they are native-born among the Israelites or a foreigner residing among them.
4:15:30/But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or a foreigner, blasphemes the LORD, and that person must be cut off from their people.
4:15:31/Because they have despised the LORD's word and broken His command, that person must be completely cut off; their guilt remains on them.
4:15:32/While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
4:15:33/Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly.
4:15:34/They kept him in custody because it was not clear what should be done to him.
4:15:35/Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must be put to death; the whole assembly must stone him outside the camp."
4:15:36/So the whole assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:15:37/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:15:38/Tell the Israelites to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a blue cord on the tassel of each corner.
4:15:39/These tassels will serve as a reminder for you to look at and remember all the LORD's commandments and to follow them, instead of following your own heart and eyes, which you are inclined to prostitute yourselves after.
4:15:40/So you will remember and follow all my commandments and be holy to your God.
4:15:41/I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD your God.
4:16:1/Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, descendants of Reuben, gathered men:
4:16:2/And they stood up against Moses, joined by some of the Israelites, two hundred and fifty leaders of the community, well-known figures:
4:16:3/They united against Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You're taking on too much power. The entire community is holy, every one of us, and the LORD is with us. So why do you elevate yourselves above the LORD's assembly?"
4:16:4/When Moses heard this, he fell face down:
4:16:5/Then he said to Korah and all his followers, "Tomorrow, the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy; he will bring that person close to him. The one he chooses, he will bring close to him.
4:16:6/Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your followers;
4:16:7/Put fire and incense in them before the LORD tomorrow. The one the LORD chooses will be the holy one. You've gone too far, sons of Levi."
4:16:8/Then Moses said to Korah, "Listen now, you Levites:
4:16:9/Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
4:16:10/He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.
4:16:11/It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"
4:16:12/Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!
4:16:13/Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?
4:16:14/Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!"
4:16:15/Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."
4:16:16/And Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you, they, and Aaron.
4:16:17/Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also."
4:16:18/So every man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
4:16:19/Then Korah gathered the whole community against them at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.
4:16:20/The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
4:16:21/"Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."
4:16:22/But they fell facedown and cried out, "O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"
4:16:23/Then the LORD said to Moses,
4:16:24/"Tell the assembly to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram."
4:16:25/Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
4:16:26/He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."
4:16:27/So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.
4:16:28/Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:
4:16:29/If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.
4:16:30/But if the LORD does something new and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt."
4:16:31/As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart
4:16:32/and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions.
4:16:33/They, and everything that belonged to them, went down alive into the grave; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.
4:16:34/At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"
4:16:35/And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
4:16:36/Then the LORD said to Moses,
4:16:37/"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy—
4:16:38/the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."
4:16:39/So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
4:16:40/as a reminder to the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he might become like Korah and his followers, as the LORD said to him through Moses.
4:16:41/But the next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said.
4:16:42/When the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
4:16:43/Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting.
4:16:44/And the LORD said to Moses,
4:16:45/"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.
4:16:46/Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, add incense, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started."
4:16:47/So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.
4:16:48/He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.
4:16:49/But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.
4:16:50/Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
4:17:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:17:2/Tell the Israelites to bring a staff from each of their ancestral tribes, twelve staffs in total. Write each man's name on his staff.
4:17:3/And you must write Aaron's name on the staff of Levi, because there should be one staff for the leader of each ancestral house.
4:17:4/Then place them in the tent of meeting in front of the covenant law where I meet with you.
4:17:5/The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout. This will put an end to the grumbling against you from the Israelites.
4:17:6/So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each tribe, and Aaron's staff was among them.
4:17:7/Moses then placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
4:17:8/The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, budded, blossomed, and produced almonds.
4:17:9/Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his own staff.
4:17:10/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Put Aaron's staff back in front of the testimony to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will end their grumbling against me, so they will not die."
4:17:11/And Moses did as the LORD commanded him.
4:17:12/The Israelites said to Moses, "Look, we're going to die, we're all going to die!"
4:17:13/Anyone who even comes close to the LORD's tabernacle will die. Are we all going to die?"
4:18:1/The LORD said to Aaron, "You, your sons, and your family will be responsible for any wrongdoing connected to the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone will be responsible for any wrongdoing connected to your priesthood.
4:18:2/Also, bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you and your sons in front of the tent of the covenant law.
4:18:3/They are to fulfill their duties to you and the whole tent. However, they must not touch the sacred objects or the altar, or they, and you, will die.
4:18:4/They are to join you and take care of the tent of meeting—doing all the work at the tent—but no outsider may come near you.
4:18:5/You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.
4:18:6/I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to do the work at the tent of meeting.
4:18:7/But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death."
4:18:8/Then the LORD said to Aaron, "I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share.
4:18:9/You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire: every offering of theirs—every grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering that they bring to me—will be most holy for you and your sons.
4:18:10/Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
4:18:11/This also is yours: the offering of their gifts, all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
4:18:12/I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the LORD as the firstfruits of their harvest.
4:18:13/All the land's firstfruits that they bring to the LORD will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
4:18:14/Everything in Israel that is devoted to the LORD is yours.
4:18:15/The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the LORD is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.
4:18:16/When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
4:18:17/But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, sheep, or goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4:18:18/Their meat belongs to you, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.
4:18:19/Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the LORD, I give to you and your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD for both you and your offspring."
4:18:20/And the LORD said to Aaron, "You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.
4:18:21/"I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.
4:18:22/From now on, the Israelites must not come near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and die.
4:18:23/It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites.
4:18:24/Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the LORD. That is why I said concerning them: 'They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.'"
4:18:25/And the LORD said to Moses,
4:18:26/"Tell the Levites: 'When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the LORD's offering.
4:18:27/Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
4:18:28/In this way, you also will present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes, you must give the LORD's portion to Aaron the priest.
4:18:29/From everything you receive, you must present the best and holiest part as the LORD's portion.
4:18:30/"Therefore, tell them: 'After you have set aside the best part, it will be reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor or the produce of the winepress.
4:18:31/You and your households may eat it anywhere, for it is your compensation for your work at the tent of meeting.
4:18:32/By presenting the best part, you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.'"
4:19:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:19:2/This is the regulation of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, Tell the Israelites to bring you a red cow without any defects, which has never been put under a yoke:
4:19:3/You must give it to Eleazar the priest, so he can take it outside the camp and have it slaughtered in his presence:
4:19:4/Then Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times in front of the tent of meeting:
4:19:5/The cow shall be burned in his sight; its skin, flesh, blood, and dung are to be burned:
4:19:6/And the priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool and throw them into the fire burning the cow.
4:19:7/After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water. Then he can come back into the camp, but he will be unclean until evening.
4:19:8/The person who burns it must also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and he will be unclean until evening.
4:19:9/A man who is clean shall collect the ashes of the cow and store them outside the camp in a clean place. They will be kept for the community of the Israelites for the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.
4:19:10/Anyone who collects the cow's ashes must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening. This will be a lasting ordinance for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them.
4:19:11/Anyone who touches a dead body will be unclean for seven days.
4:19:12/He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he will not be clean.
4:19:13/Anyone who touches a dead body and does not purify himself defiles the LORD's tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he remains unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.
4:19:14/This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everything in the tent will be unclean for seven days.
4:19:15/And every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.
4:19:16/Anyone who touches someone who has been killed with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a human bone, or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
4:19:17/For an unclean person, they shall take some of the ashes of the burned purification offering and fresh water shall be added in a vessel.
4:19:18/A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there, and on anyone who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or a grave.
4:19:19/The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day. On the seventh day, he must purify himself, wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and at evening he will be clean.
4:19:20/But the person who remains unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the community because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
4:19:21/It shall be a lasting statute for them. The one who sprinkles the water of cleansing must wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean until evening.
4:19:22/Whatever the unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening.
4:20:1/Then the children of Israel, the entire community, arrived in the Desert of Zin in the first month, and they stayed in Kadesh. There, Miriam passed away and was buried.
4:20:2/And there was no water for the community, so they united in opposition to Moses and Aaron.
4:20:3/The people argued with Moses, saying, "If only we had perished when our brothers died before the Lord!
4:20:4/Why did you bring the Lord's community into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?
4:20:5/Why did you lead us out of Egypt to bring us to this terrible place? It's not a place for crops, figs, vines, or pomegranates, and there's no water to drink."
4:20:6/Moses and Aaron left the assembly and went to the entrance of the tent of meeting, where they fell facedown. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
4:20:7/And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:20:8/"Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly. Speak to the rock in their presence, and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for them, providing drink for the community and their animals."
4:20:9/Moses took the staff from before the Lord, as he had been commanded.
4:20:10/Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?"
4:20:11/Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their animals drank.
4:20:12/But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not lead this community into the land I have given them."
4:20:13/This place was called the waters of Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled with the Lord, and he showed himself holy among them.
4:20:14/Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying, "Your brother Israel says, 'You know all the hardships that have come upon us.
4:20:15/Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there a long time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors,
4:20:16/but when we cried out to the Lord, he heard our plea and sent an angel to bring us out of Egypt. Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
4:20:17/Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any fields or vineyards, or drink water from any wells. We will travel along the King's Highway and not turn aside to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.'"
4:20:18/But Edom answered, "You may not pass through my land, or I will come out to meet you with the sword."
4:20:19/The Israelites replied, "We will stick to the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else."
4:20:20/Yet he said, "You may not pass through." And Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.
4:20:21/So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory, and Israel turned away from him.
4:20:22/Then the entire Israelite community left Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
4:20:23/And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,
4:20:24/"Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I have given to the Israelites because you both rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
4:20:25/Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.
4:20:26/Remove Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there."
4:20:27/So Moses did as the Lord commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
4:20:28/Moses removed Aaron's garments and dressed Eleazar his son in them. Aaron died there at the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
4:20:29/When the entire community realized that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for Aaron for thirty days.
4:21:1/When King Arad the Canaanite, who lived in the south, heard that Israel was coming by the way of the spies, he fought against Israel and captured some of them.
4:21:2/And Israel made a promise to the LORD, saying, "If you truly give this people into our hands, then we will completely destroy their cities."
4:21:3/The LORD listened to Israel's plea and handed over the Canaanites; they completely destroyed them and their cities. The place was then named Hormah.
4:21:4/They traveled from Mount Hor by the route of the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom, and the people became very discouraged because of the journey.
4:21:5/The people complained against God and Moses, asking, "Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There's no bread or water, and we can't stand this worthless food."
4:21:6/Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people, causing many Israelites to die.
4:21:7/So the people came to Moses and admitted, "We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD to take the snakes away from us." Moses prayed for the people.
4:21:8/And the LORD told Moses, "Make a snake and put it on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."
4:21:9/Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Then, whenever someone was bitten and they looked at the bronze snake, they lived.
4:21:10/The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
4:21:11/They traveled from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab toward the sunrise.
4:21:12/From there they moved and camped in the Zered Valley.
4:21:13/From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending from Amorite territory. For Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
4:21:14/This is why it is mentioned in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, "What He did at the Red Sea, and at the streams of Arnon,"
4:21:15/And at the stream that flows to the settlement of Ar, lying at the border of Moab.
4:21:16/From there they went to Beer, which is the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
4:21:17/Then Israel sang this song, "Spring up, O well; let us sing to it."
4:21:18/The leaders dug the well, the nobles of the people dug it, under the direction of the lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,
4:21:19/And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
4:21:20/And from Bamoth in the valley, in the territory of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the wasteland.
4:21:21/Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
4:21:22/"Let us pass through your land. We won't turn into the fields or vineyards; we won't drink water from the wells. We will travel along the king's highway until we have passed through your territory."
4:21:23/But Sihon wouldn't allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people and went out against Israel into the wilderness, coming to Jahaz to fight against Israel.
4:21:24/Israel defeated him with the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, up to the Ammonite border, which was fortified.
4:21:25/Israel captured all these cities and settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and all its villages.
4:21:26/For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land up to the Arnon.
4:21:27/That's why those who tell stories say, "Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; let the city of Sihon be established."
4:21:28/A fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the rulers of the high places of the Arnon.
4:21:29/Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon, king of the Amorites.
4:21:30/We have shot them down; Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have laid waste as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba.
4:21:31/Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
4:21:32/Moses sent to explore Jaazer, and they captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
4:21:33/Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og, the king of Bashan, came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
4:21:34/But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, along with all his people and his land. You will do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon."
4:21:35/So they defeated him, his sons, and all his people, until no one was left alive, and they took possession of his land.
4:22:1/The Israelites moved on and camped in the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River from Jericho.
4:22:2/Balak, son of Zippor, saw everything Israel had done to the Amorites.
4:22:3/Moab was terrified because there were so many Israelites; Moab was overwhelmed with dread because of them.
4:22:4/Moab said to the elders of Midian, "This horde will devour everything around us, just as an ox eats up the grass of the field." Balak, son of Zippor, was the king of Moab at that time.
4:22:5/So he sent messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land, with a message: "A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the land and are settling across from me.
4:22:6/Come now and curse these people for me; they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I'll be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed."
4:22:7/The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.
4:22:8/Balaam said to them, "Stay here for the night, and I'll bring back the answer the Lord gives me." So the Moabite officials stayed with him.
4:22:9/God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"
4:22:10/Balaam said to God, "Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
4:22:11/'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the land. Now come and curse them for me. Perhaps then I'll be able to fight them and drive them away.'"
4:22:12/But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not curse the people, for they are blessed."
4:22:13/The next morning, Balaam got up and said to Balak's officials, "Go back to your own country, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you."
4:22:14/So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."
4:22:15/Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.
4:22:16/They came to Balaam and said, "This is what Balak, son of Zippor, says: 'Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,
4:22:17/for I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and curse this people for me.'"
4:22:18/But Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything, small or great, that goes beyond the command of the Lord my God.
4:22:19/Now please stay here tonight, as the others did, so I can find out what else the Lord will tell me."
4:22:20/That night God came to Balaam and said, "If these men have come to summon you, go with them, but only do what I tell you."
4:22:21/So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moabite officials.
4:22:22/But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants.
4:22:23/The donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, so the donkey turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat the donkey to get it back on the road.
4:22:24/Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides.
4:22:25/When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat the donkey again.
4:22:26/The angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.
4:22:27/When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff.
4:22:28/Then the Lord opened the donkey's mouth, and it said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?"
4:22:29/Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."
4:22:30/The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" "No," he said.
4:22:31/Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.
4:22:32/The angel of the Lord asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is reckless before me.
4:22:33/The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it."
4:22:34/Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."
4:22:35/The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with Balak's officials.
4:22:36/When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
4:22:37/Balak said to Balaam, "Didn't I send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able to reward you?"
4:22:38/Balaam said to Balak, "Look, I've come to you now, but I can't say just anything. I will speak only what God puts in my mouth."
4:22:39/Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.
4:22:40/Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the officials who were with him.
4:22:41/The next day, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, so he could see a portion of the people.
4:23:1/Balaam told Balak, "Set up seven altars for me here, and get ready seven oxen and seven rams for me."
4:23:2/And Balak did as Balaam had instructed; they both offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4:23:3/Balaam then said to Balak, "Stay by your burnt offering, and I'll go see if the LORD comes to meet me. Whatever he shows me, I'll tell you." And he went to a high place.
4:23:4/And God met Balaam and he told Him, "I've set up seven altars and have offered a bull and a ram on each one."
4:23:5/The LORD gave Balaam a message and said, "Go back to Balak and say this."
4:23:6/He went back to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, along with all the Moabite leaders.
4:23:7/Then he began his message, saying, "King Balak of Moab brought me from Aram, from the eastern mountains, saying, 'Come, curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'"
4:23:8/"How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?
4:23:9/From the mountaintops, I see them, from the hills, I view them; there lies a people living apart, not considered among the nations.
4:23:10/"Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like theirs!"
4:23:11/And Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you've blessed them completely."
4:23:12/He replied, "Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
4:23:13/Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place where you can see them; you will only see a part of them and not all. Curse them for me from there."
4:23:14/So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, offering a bull and a ram on each altar.
4:23:15/Then he said to Balak, "Stay here by your burnt offering while I go to meet the LORD over there."
4:23:16/And the LORD met Balaam and put a message in his mouth, saying, "Go back to Balak and say this."
4:23:17/When he returned, there was Balak, standing by his burnt offering, with the Moabite leaders. And Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?"
4:23:18/He delivered his message, saying, "Get up, Balak, and listen; hear me out, son of Zippor:
4:23:19/God is not a human that He should lie, nor a mortal that He should change His mind. Does He speak and then not act? Does He promise and not fulfill?
4:23:20/See, I've received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot change it.
4:23:21/He has not seen wrongdoing in Jacob, nor has He seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and the shout of a king is among them.
4:23:22/God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
4:23:23/No magic spell can bind Jacob, no sorcery can hold Israel. At this time it will be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!'
4:23:24/Look, a people rising like a lioness, and rousing itself like a lion, not resting until it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims."
4:23:25/Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
4:23:26/But Balaam answered Balak, "Didn't I tell you, 'Whatever the LORD says, that I must do'?"
4:23:27/And Balak said to Balaam, "Come, please, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there."
4:23:28/So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the desert.
4:23:29/And Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here."
4:23:30/And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4:24:1/When Balaam realized that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he didn't seek enchantments as before, but instead, he looked toward the wilderness.
4:24:2/Balaam looked up and saw Israel living in their tents by tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
4:24:3/He began his prophetic speech, saying, "Balaam, the son of Beor, declares, the man with clear vision states:
4:24:4/"He speaks, who listened to God's words, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, yet with eyes wide open:
4:24:5/"How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel!
4:24:6/"They spread out like valleys, like gardens by the river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.
4:24:7/"He will pour water from his buckets, and his offspring will thrive in abundant waters, his king will be greater than Agag, and his kingdom will be lifted high.
4:24:8/"God brought him out of Egypt; he has the strength of a wild ox: he will consume the nations opposing him, crush their bones, and pierce them with his arrows.
4:24:9/"He crouches, lies down like a lion, like a mighty lion: who dares to rouse him? Blessed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you."
4:24:10/Balak's anger flared against Balaam, and he clapped his hands in frustration: Balak said to Balaam, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, and yet, you've blessed them three times over.
4:24:11/"Now, run back to your place! I intended to honor you greatly, but the LORD has kept you from honor."
4:24:12/Balaam replied to Balak, "Didn't I also tell your messengers you sent to me,
4:24:13/'Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the LORD's command to do good or bad on my own; I will say only what the LORD tells me'?
4:24:14/"And now, I'm returning to my people. Let me tell you what this people will do to your people in the days to come."
4:24:15/He continued his prophetic speech, saying, "Balaam, the son of Beor, declares, the man with clear vision states:
4:24:16/"He speaks, who listened to God's words, who understood the knowledge of the Most High, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, yet with eyes wide open:
4:24:17/"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near: a Star will come out of Jacob, a Scepter will rise out of Israel, and will crush the borders of Moab, and destroy all the sons of Sheth.
4:24:18/"Edom will become a possession, Seir also will be conquered by their enemies; and Israel will act valiantly.
4:24:19/"A ruler will come out of Jacob, who will destroy the survivors of the city.
4:24:20/When he saw Amalek, he began his prophetic speech, saying, "Amalek was the foremost of nations, but its end is to perish forever."
4:24:21/He looked at the Kenites, and began his prophetic speech, saying, "Your dwelling place is strong, and you put your nest in a rock.
4:24:22/"Yet the Kenite will be destroyed, until Asshur takes you away captive."
4:24:23/He continued his prophetic speech, saying, "Alas, who can survive when God does this!
4:24:24/"Ships will come from the coast of Kittim, they will subdue Asshur and Eber, and they too will come to ruin forever."
4:24:25/Balaam got up, went back to his place, and Balak also went on his way.
4:25:1/Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to engage in sexual immorality with the women of Moab.
4:25:2/They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
4:25:3/Israel aligned himself with Baalpeor, and the LORD's anger burned against Israel.
4:25:4/The LORD told Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people, and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that my fierce anger may turn away from Israel."
4:25:5/Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you must kill those of your men who have aligned themselves with Baalpeor."
4:25:6/Then, one of the Israelites brought a Midianite woman to his brothers right in front of Moses and the whole Israelite community, who were mourning at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
4:25:7/When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw this, he stood up from among the assembly, took a spear in his hand,
4:25:8/and followed the Israelite man into the tent, and drove the spear through both the Israelite man and the woman's abdomen. Thus, the plague against the Israelites was stopped.
4:25:9/But those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
4:25:10/The LORD said to Moses,
4:25:11/"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the Israelites by being zealous with my zeal among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in my jealousy."
4:25:12/Therefore, say, 'I grant him my covenant of peace:
4:25:13/And it shall be to him and his descendants after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the Israelites.'"
4:25:14/The name of the slain Israelite man, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, son of Salu, a leader of a Simeonite family.
4:25:15/And the name of the slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, daughter of Zur; he was a leader of a people, a family head in Midian.
4:25:16/The LORD said to Moses,
4:25:17/"Treat the Midianites as enemies and strike them down,
4:25:18/because they treated you as enemies by their deceit in the affair of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague because of Peor."
4:26:1/After the plague ended, the LORD spoke to Moses and Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
4:26:2/Count all the members of the Israelite community who are twenty years old or older and able to serve in the army, including everyone by their ancestral families.
4:26:3/Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho, saying,
4:26:4/Count the people from twenty years old and older, as the LORD instructed Moses and the Israelites who had left Egypt.
4:26:5/Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, had sons: Hanoch, from whom the Hanochite family comes; Pallu, from whom the Palluite family comes;
4:26:6/Hezron, from whom the Hezronite family comes; Carmi, from whom the Carmite family comes.
4:26:7/These are the families of the Reubenites, and their count was forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.
4:26:8/Pallu had sons: Eliab.
4:26:9/Eliab's sons were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram who were community leaders who rebelled against Moses and Aaron in Korah's group when they rebelled against the LORD.
4:26:10/The earth opened up and swallowed them along with Korah, when that group died and fire consumed two hundred and fifty men, serving as a warning.
4:26:11/However, Korah's children did not die.
4:26:12/The sons of Simeon by their families were: Nemuel, from whom the Nemuelite family comes; Jamin, from whom the Jaminite family comes; Jachin, from whom the Jachinite family comes;

4:26:53/The land will be divided as an inheritance based on the number of names.
4:26:54/More land will be given to those with larger numbers and less to those with smaller numbers; each will receive an inheritance based on their numbers.
4:26:55/However, the land will be divided by drawing lots; they will inherit according to the names of their ancestral tribes.
4:26:56/The division of the land will be by lot, whether for many or for few.

4:26:60/Aaron had sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
4:26:61/Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD.
4:26:62/The count of the Levites was twenty-three thousand, all males a month old or older; they were not included among the Israelites because they did not receive an inheritance among them.
4:26:63/These were counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who registered the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho.
4:26:64/Among these, there was not one who had been counted by Moses and Aaron the priest when they registered the Israelites in the Sinai wilderness.
4:26:65/The LORD had said they would surely die in the wilderness, and not one was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4:27:1/Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, approached. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4:27:2/They presented themselves before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the entire community at the entrance of the meeting tent, saying,
4:27:3/"Our father passed away in the wilderness. He wasn't part of Korah's rebellion against the LORD; he died because of his own sin and left no sons.
4:27:4/Why should our father's name disappear from his family just because he had no son? Give us property among our father's brothers."
4:27:5/Moses brought their case before the LORD.
4:27:6/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:27:7/"The daughters of Zelophehad are correct. You must indeed give them property as an inheritance among their father's brothers and transfer their father's inheritance to them.
4:27:8/Also, tell the Israelites, 'If a man dies and has no son, then you must transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
4:27:9/If he has no daughter, then you should give his inheritance to his brothers.
4:27:10/If he has no brothers, then you should give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
4:27:11/If his father has no brothers, then you should give his inheritance to the closest relative in his family, and he will own it. This will be a legal requirement for the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses."
4:27:12/Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up into this Mount Abarim and see the land I have given to the Israelites.
4:27:13/After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was.
4:27:14/Because you both disobeyed my command in the Desert of Zin during the dispute of the community, failing to uphold my holiness in their presence at the waters." These are the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin.
4:27:15/And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
4:27:16/"May the LORD, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over the community
4:27:17/who will go out and come in before them, who will lead them out and bring them in, so the LORD's people will not be like sheep without a shepherd."
4:27:18/And the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man who has the spirit, and lay your hand on him;
4:27:19/Place him before Eleazar the priest and the entire community, and give him his instructions in their presence.
4:27:20/Transfer some of your authority to him so the whole Israelite community will obey him.
4:27:21/He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the LORD. At his command, they will go out and at his command, they will come in, both he and all the Israelites with him, the entire community."
4:27:22/And Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and presented him before Eleazar the priest and the whole community,
4:27:23/laying his hands on him and giving him his charge, just as the LORD had instructed through Moses.
4:28:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:28:2/Tell the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, and my food for my sacrifices made by fire, for a pleasing aroma to me, you must make sure to offer to me at the right times.
4:28:3/And you shall tell them, This is the fire offering you are to present to the LORD; two unblemished lambs of the first year, every day, as a regular burnt offering.
4:28:4/You must offer one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb you must offer in the evening.
4:28:5/And a tenth of an ephah of flour for a grain offering, mixed with a quarter of a hin of pressed oil.
4:28:6/It is a regular burnt offering, established at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
4:28:7/And the drink offering with it shall be a quarter of a hin for each lamb; in the sacred place you must pour out strong wine to the LORD as a drink offering.
4:28:8/And the other lamb you must offer in the evening: like the grain offering of the morning, and its drink offering, you must offer it as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4:28:9/And on the sabbath day two unblemished lambs of the first year, and two tenths of an ephah of flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, and its drink offering.
4:28:10/This is the burnt offering for every sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering, and its drink offering.
4:28:11/And at the start of your months you must present a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bulls, and one ram, seven unblemished lambs of the first year.
4:28:12/And three tenths of an ephah of flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for one bull; and two tenths of an ephah of flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for one ram;
4:28:13/And a tenth of an ephah of flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for one lamb; as a burnt offering of a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
4:28:14/And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, a third of a hin for a ram, and a quarter of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year.
4:28:15/And one goat for a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, in addition to the regular burnt offering, and its drink offering.
4:28:16/And on the fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD's Passover.
4:28:17/And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast; for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.
4:28:18/On the first day there shall be a sacred assembly; you must not do any ordinary work on it.
4:28:19/But you must offer a fire offering, a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bulls, one ram, and seven unblemished lambs of the first year: they must be without defect for you.
4:28:20/And their grain offering shall be of flour mixed with oil: three tenths for a bull, and two tenths for a ram;
4:28:21/A tenth for each lamb, for all seven lambs;
4:28:22/And one goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
4:28:23/You must offer these in addition to the morning burnt offering, which is for a regular burnt offering.
4:28:24/In this way you must offer daily, for seven days, the food of the fire offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD; it must be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering, and its drink offering.
4:28:25/And on the seventh day you shall have a sacred assembly; you must not do any ordinary work.
4:28:26/Also on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the LORD, after your weeks are out, you shall have a sacred assembly; you must not do any ordinary work.
4:28:27/But you must offer the burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to the LORD; two young bulls, one ram, seven lambs of the first year.
4:28:28/And their grain offering of flour mixed with oil, three tenths for one bull, two tenths for one ram,
4:28:29/A tenth for each lamb, for all seven lambs;

4:28:31/You must offer them in addition to the regular burnt offering, and its grain offering, (they must be without defect for you) and their drink offerings.
4:29:1/On the first day of the seventh month, you must have a sacred gathering; you are not to do any regular work: it is a day for blowing trumpets for you.
4:29:2/You must present a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD; one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without any defects:

4:29:4/And one-tenth for each lamb, for all seven lambs: 
4:29:5/And one goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you: 
4:29:6/In addition to the monthly burnt offering, its grain offering, the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to the prescribed rules, as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
4:29:7/On the tenth day of this seventh month you must have a sacred gathering; you must humble yourselves: you are not to do any work on that day: 
4:29:8/But you must present a burnt offering to the LORD as a pleasing aroma; one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they must be without any defects for you:

4:29:33/Their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, must be according to their number, as prescribed: 
4:29:34/And one goat for a sin offering; in addition to the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering.
4:29:35/On the eighth day you must have a solemn assembly: you are not to do any regular work on that day: 
4:29:36/But you must present a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to the LORD: one bull, one ram, seven lambs of the first year without any defects: 
4:29:37/Their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bull, for the ram, and for the lambs, must be according to their number, as prescribed: 
4:29:38/And one goat for a sin offering; in addition to the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering.
4:29:39/These things you must do for the LORD at your appointed festivals, in addition to your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, for your grain offerings, for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.
4:29:40/And Moses told the children of Israel everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:30:1/Moses spoke to the leaders of the tribes about the Israelites, saying, "This is what the LORD has commanded.
4:30:2/If a man makes a promise to the LORD, or swears an oath to commit himself with a pledge; he must not break his promise, he must do everything he said he would.
4:30:3/If a woman makes a promise to the LORD, and commits herself with a pledge, while she is living in her father's house during her youth;
4:30:4/And her father hears her promise, and the pledge by which she has committed herself, and her father does not object; then all her promises shall be upheld, and every pledge by which she has committed herself shall be upheld.
4:30:5/But if her father objects on the day he hears about it; none of her promises, or the pledges by which she has committed herself, shall be upheld: and the LORD will forgive her, because her father objected.
4:30:6/And if she is married, when she makes a promise, or says anything that commits herself;
4:30:7/And her husband hears it, and does not object on the day he hears it: then her promises shall be upheld, and the pledges by which she has committed herself shall be upheld.
4:30:8/But if her husband objects on the day he hears it; then he can nullify the promise she made, and what she said that committed herself, making it not valid: and the LORD will forgive her.
4:30:9/But every promise made by a widow, or by a divorced woman, by which they have committed themselves, shall be binding on her.
4:30:10/And if she made a promise in her husband's house, or committed herself with a pledge by an oath;
4:30:11/And her husband hears it, and does not object, and does not nullify it: then all her promises shall be upheld, and every pledge by which she has committed herself shall be upheld.
4:30:12/But if her husband nullifies them on the day he hears them; then whatever she said concerning her promises, or concerning the pledge of her commitment, shall not be upheld: her husband has nullified them; and the LORD will forgive her.
4:30:13/Every promise, and every binding oath to commit oneself, her husband can uphold it, or her husband can nullify it.
4:30:14/But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day; then he upholds all her promises, or all her pledges, which are upon her: he confirms them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them.
4:30:15/But if he nullifies them after he has heard them; then he shall bear the consequences of her actions.
4:30:16/These are the regulations, which the LORD commanded Moses, for a husband and his wife, and for a father and his daughter, while she is still young and living in her father's house.
4:31:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:31:2/Get revenge for the Israelites on the Midianites; afterward, you will join your ancestors in death.
4:31:3/And Moses told the people, "Prepare some of you for battle, and attack the Midianites to avenge the LORD.
4:31:4/From each tribe of Israel, send a thousand men to fight.
4:31:5/So from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand prepared for battle were provided.
4:31:6/And Moses sent them to battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the sacred objects and the trumpets for signaling in his hand.
4:31:7/And they fought against the Midianites, as the LORD had commanded Moses; and they killed all the men.
4:31:8/They also killed the kings of Midian, along with others killed; namely, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
4:31:9/The Israelites captured all the Midianite women and children, and took all their cattle, flocks, and goods as loot.
4:31:10/They burned all the places where the Midianites had lived and all their encampments.
4:31:11/They took all the loot and all the captives, both people and animals.
4:31:12/And they brought the captives, the loot, and the spoils to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the Israelite community, at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
4:31:13/Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went outside the camp to meet them.
4:31:14/Moses was angry with the commanders of the army, the leaders of thousands and hundreds, who returned from the battle.
4:31:15/And Moses asked them, "Have you let all the women live?
4:31:16/These women caused the Israelites, through Balaam's advice, to be unfaithful to the LORD in the Peor incident, so a plague struck the LORD's community.
4:31:17/Now, kill every male among the children, and kill every woman who has slept with a man.
4:31:18/But save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
4:31:19/Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third and seventh days, purify yourselves and your captives.
4:31:20/Also purify every garment, everything made of leather, goat hair, and wood."
4:31:21/And Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses:
4:31:22/Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead,
4:31:23/Everything that can withstand fire, you must put through the fire to purify it, but it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. Everything that cannot withstand fire, you must put through water.
4:31:24/On the seventh day, wash your clothes and you will be clean. After that, you may enter the camp."
4:31:25/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:31:26/Count the loot that was taken, both of people and animals, you, Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the community.
4:31:27/Divide the loot between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
4:31:28/Set aside a portion for the LORD from the soldiers who fought in the battle: one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys, or sheep.
4:31:29/Take this portion from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
4:31:30/From the Israelites' half, take one out of every fifty, from the people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or any other animals, and give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD's Tabernacle.
4:31:31/And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:31:32/The loot, aside from what the soldiers took, was 675,000 sheep,
4:31:33/72,000 cattle,
4:31:34/61,000 donkeys,
4:31:35/And 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.
4:31:36/The half share of those who went to war was 337,500 sheep,
4:31:37/And the LORD's tribute from the sheep was 675.
4:31:38/The cattle numbered 36,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 72.
4:31:39/The donkeys were 30,500, of which the LORD's tribute was 61.
4:31:40/The people numbered 16,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 32 people.
4:31:41/And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:31:42/And from the Israelites' half, which Moses separated from the men who fought
4:31:43/(Now the community's half was 337,500 sheep,
4:31:44/36,000 cattle,
4:31:45/30,500 donkeys,
4:31:46/And 16,000 people;)
4:31:47/From the Israelites' half, Moses took one out of every fifty, both of people and animals, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD's Tabernacle, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:31:48/The commanders of thousands and hundreds approached Moses
4:31:49/And said to him, "Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.
4:31:50/Therefore, we have brought an offering for the LORD, what each of us found - gold jewelry, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and pendants - to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
4:31:51/And Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from them, all crafted items.
4:31:52/All the gold given as an offering to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and hundreds, was 16,750 shekels.
4:31:53/(The soldiers had taken loot for themselves.)
4:31:54/And Moses and Eleazar the priest brought the gold from the commanders of thousands and hundreds into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
4:32:1/The descendants of Reuben and Gad had a vast number of livestock. When they saw the lands of Jazer and Gilead, they realized these places were perfect for raising cattle.
4:32:2/The descendants of Gad and Reuben approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community, saying,
4:32:3/Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon,
4:32:4/These regions, which the LORD conquered before the Israelite community, are ideal for livestock, and we have livestock.
4:32:5/Therefore, they proposed, if we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to us as our property. Do not make us cross the Jordan River.
4:32:6/Moses responded to the descendants of Gad and Reuben, "Are your brothers to go to war while you stay here?
4:32:7/Why would you discourage the Israelites from crossing into the land the LORD has given them?
4:32:8/This is what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land.
4:32:9/After they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.
4:32:10/And the LORD became very angry at that time and swore an oath,
4:32:11/Saying, 'Certainly, none of the men aged twenty and above who came from Egypt will see the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not fully followed me,
4:32:12/Except for Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua son of Nun, for they have wholeheartedly followed the LORD.'
4:32:13/The LORD's anger burned against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until the entire generation that had done evil in his sight was gone.
4:32:14/And now, you, a brood of sinners, stand in your ancestors' place, adding more to the LORD's fierce anger against Israel.
4:32:15/If you turn away from following him, he will again leave them in the wilderness, and you will be responsible for their destruction."
4:32:16/They approached him and said, "We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our children.
4:32:17/But we are ready to arm ourselves and lead the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile, our children will stay in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
4:32:18/We will not return to our homes until each Israelite has received their inheritance.
4:32:19/We will not claim any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan River or beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan."
4:32:20/Moses said to them, "If you do this, if you arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,
4:32:21/And all of you armed men cross the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
4:32:22/And the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you may return guiltless before the LORD and Israel, and this land will be your possession before the LORD.
4:32:23/But if you do not do this, you will be sinning against the LORD, and be sure your sin will catch up with you.
4:32:24/Build cities for your children and pens for your sheep, and do what you have promised."
4:32:25/The descendants of Gad and Reuben said to Moses, "Your servants will do as my lord commands.
4:32:26/Our children, wives, flocks, and all our livestock will stay in the cities of Gilead,
4:32:27/But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over before the LORD to fight, just as my lord says."
4:32:28/So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the Israelite tribes.
4:32:29/Moses said to them, "If the descendants of Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan with you, every man equipped for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then give them the land of Gilead as a possession.
4:32:30/However, if they do not cross over armed, they must accept their possessions among you in Canaan."
4:32:31/The descendants of Gad and Reuben replied, "As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do.
4:32:32/We will cross over armed before the LORD into Canaan, so the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan may be ours."
4:32:33/And Moses gave to them, to the descendants of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the land along with its cities and territories, the cities of the surrounding country.
4:32:34/The descendants of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer,
4:32:35/And Atroth, Shophan, Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
4:32:36/And Bethnimrah and Bethharan as fortified cities, and built pens for their sheep.
4:32:37/And the descendants of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
4:32:38/And Nebo and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and Sibmah. They renamed the cities they rebuilt.
4:32:39/The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there.
4:32:40/And Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there.
4:32:41/Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their villages and called them Havoth Jair.
4:32:42/And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements, and renamed it Nobah after himself.
4:33:1/These are the travels of the Israelites, who left Egypt organized by their armies under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
4:33:2/And Moses recorded their departures according to their journeys as instructed by the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their departures.
4:33:3/They left Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; the day after the Passover, the Israelites left boldly in full view of all the Egyptians.
4:33:4/For the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them. On their gods, the LORD also executed judgments.
4:33:5/The Israelites moved from Rameses and camped in Succoth.
4:33:6/They left Succoth and camped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
4:33:7/They left Etham, turned back to Pihahiroth, east of Baalzephon, and camped near Migdol.
4:33:8/They left from before Pihahiroth, passed through the sea into the wilderness, traveled for three days in the wilderness of Etham, and camped in Marah.
4:33:9/They moved from Marah and arrived at Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they camped there.
4:33:10/They moved from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
4:33:11/They moved from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
4:33:12/They journeyed from the wilderness of Sin and camped in Dophkah.
4:33:13/They left Dophkah and camped in Alush.
4:33:14/They moved from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
4:33:15/They left Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
4:33:16/They moved from the desert of Sinai and camped at Kibrothhattaavah.
4:33:17/They left Kibrothhattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
4:33:18/They left Hazeroth and camped in Rithmah.
4:33:19/They left Rithmah and camped at Rimmonparez.
4:33:20/They left Rimmonparez and camped in Libnah.
4:33:21/They moved from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
4:33:22/They journeyed from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah.
4:33:23/They went from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shapher.
4:33:24/They moved from Mount Shapher and camped in Haradah.
4:33:25/They moved from Haradah and camped in Makheloth.
4:33:26/They moved from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
4:33:27/They left Tahath and camped at Tarah.
4:33:28/They moved from Tarah and camped in Mithcah.
4:33:29/They went from Mithcah and camped in Hashmonah.
4:33:30/They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
4:33:31/They left Moseroth and camped in Benejaakan.
4:33:32/They moved from Benejaakan and camped at Horhagidgad.
4:33:33/They went from Horhagidgad and camped in Jotbathah.
4:33:34/They moved from Jotbathah and camped at Ebronah.
4:33:35/They left Ebronah and camped at Eziongaber.
4:33:36/They moved from Eziongaber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
4:33:37/They moved from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom.
4:33:38/Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor at the LORD's command and died there, in the fortieth year after the Israelites had left Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.
4:33:39/Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
4:33:40/When King Arad the Canaanite, who lived in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the Israelites' approach.
4:33:41/They left Mount Hor and camped in Zalmonah.
4:33:42/They left Zalmonah and camped in Punon.
4:33:43/They left Punon and camped in Oboth.
4:33:44/They left Oboth and camped in Ijeabarim, on the border of Moab.
4:33:45/They left Iim and camped in Dibongad.
4:33:46/They moved from Dibongad and camped in Almondiblathaim.
4:33:47/They moved from Almondiblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
4:33:48/They left the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho.
4:33:49/And they camped by the Jordan, from Bethjesimoth to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
4:33:50/And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho, saying,
4:33:51/Tell the Israelites, when you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
4:33:52/you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, destroy all their carved images and molten idols, and demolish all their high places.
4:33:53/You will take over the land and live in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
4:33:54/You shall divide the land by lot as an inheritance among your families. To the larger groups you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller groups a smaller one. Each group's inheritance will be where their lot falls. According to the tribes of your ancestors, you will inherit.
4:33:55/But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain will become irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land where you live.
4:33:56/And it will happen that I will do to you as I planned to do to them.
4:34:1/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:34:2/Tell the Israelites, when you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that will be your inheritance, the land of Canaan with its boundaries.
4:34:3/Your southern boundary will start from the Zin Desert along the border of Edom. Your southern border will be the easternmost part of the Salt Sea.
4:34:4/Your border will turn from the south up to the Scorpion Pass, continue to Zin, and from the south to Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon.
4:34:5/From Azmon, the border will turn toward the Brook of Egypt, and its end will be at the Mediterranean Sea.
4:34:6/For your western boundary, you will have the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your western border.
4:34:7/Your northern boundary will start from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor.
4:34:8/From Mount Hor, you will mark out your border to the entrance of Hamath, and the end of the border will be at Zedad.
4:34:9/Then the border will extend to Ziphron, and its end will be at Hazar Enan. This will be your northern border.
4:34:10/You will mark out your eastern border from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
4:34:11/The border will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain, then descend and rest on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
4:34:12/Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. This will be your land with its surrounding boundaries.
4:34:13/And Moses commanded the Israelites, saying, This is the land you will inherit by drawing lots, as the LORD has commanded for the nine and a half tribes.
4:34:14/For the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance. These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan near Jericho, toward the sunrise.
4:34:15/The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan near Jericho, to the east, toward the sunrise.
4:34:16/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:34:17/These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun.
4:34:18/You must select one leader from each tribe to help divide the land for inheritance.
4:34:19/The leaders are as follows: For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.
4:34:20/For the tribe of Simeon, Shemuel son of Ammihud.
4:34:21/For the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon.
4:34:22/For the tribe of Dan, Bukki son of Jogli.
4:34:23/For the tribe of Manasseh, Hanniel son of Ephod.
4:34:24/For the tribe of Ephraim, Kemuel son of Shiphtan.
4:34:25/For the tribe of Zebulun, Elizaphan son of Parnach.
4:34:26/For the tribe of Issachar, Paltiel son of Azzan.
4:34:27/For the tribe of Asher, Ahihud son of Shelomi.
4:34:28/For the tribe of Naphtali, Pedahel son of Ammihud.
4:34:29/These are the ones the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance among the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
4:35:1/The LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho, saying,
4:35:2/Tell the Israelites to give the Levites cities to live in from their own possessions; and you must also give the Levites the surrounding lands of those cities.
4:35:3/The cities will be their homes, and the surrounding lands will be for their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals.
4:35:4/The lands around the cities that you give to the Levites should extend outward a thousand cubits from the city walls all around.
4:35:5/You must measure 2000 cubits from the city edge in every direction—east, south, west, and north—with the city in the center. These areas will be the Levites' surrounding lands.
4:35:6/Among the cities you give to the Levites, six must be designated as cities of refuge for anyone who accidentally kills someone, so they can flee there. In addition, give them forty-two other cities.
4:35:7/So, in total, you will give the Levites forty-eight cities with their surrounding lands.
4:35:8/The cities you give will come from the possessions of the Israelites. From those with more, you will give more; from those with less, you will give less. Each tribe will give some of its cities to the Levites, proportional to its inheritance.
4:35:9/And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:35:10/Tell the Israelites that when they cross the Jordan into Canaan,
4:35:11/they must designate cities as cities of refuge for anyone who accidentally kills someone, so they can flee there.
4:35:12/These cities will be your refuge from the avenger, ensuring that the person who killed someone accidentally does not die before they stand trial before the community.
4:35:13/You must designate six of these cities as cities of refuge.
4:35:14/You will designate three cities on the east side of the Jordan and three cities in Canaan as cities of refuge.
4:35:15/These six cities will serve as a refuge for both the Israelites and any foreigners living among them, so anyone who kills a person accidentally can flee there.
4:35:16/If someone kills another with an iron object, causing death, that person is a murderer and must be put to death.
4:35:17/If someone kills another by throwing a stone that could cause death, and it does, that person is a murderer and must be put to death.
4:35:18/Or if someone kills another with a wooden object that could cause death, and it does, that person is a murderer and must be put to death.
4:35:19/The avenger of blood can kill the murderer upon encountering them.
4:35:20/But if someone pushes another out of hatred, or throws something at them lying in wait, causing death,
4:35:21/Or in hostility hits them with their hand, causing death, the person who struck the blow must be put to death; they are a murderer. The avenger of blood can kill the murderer upon encountering them.
4:35:22/But if someone pushes another suddenly without hostility, or throws anything at them without lying in wait,
4:35:23/Or uses any stone that could cause death without seeing the person, causing their death without being their enemy or intending harm,
4:35:24/Then the community must judge between the killer and the avenger of blood according to these rules.
4:35:25/The community must protect the killer from the avenger of blood and send them back to the city of refuge where they had fled, and they must stay there until the high priest, who was anointed with holy oil, dies.
4:35:26/But if the killer ever leaves the area of their city of refuge,
4:35:27/And the avenger of blood finds them outside the city of refuge and kills them, the avenger will not be guilty of murder.
4:35:28/The killer must stay within the bounds of their city of refuge until the high priest dies. After that, they can return to their own property.
4:35:29/These instructions will serve as a legal standard for you throughout your generations wherever you live.
4:35:30/Anyone who kills a person must be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one can be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
4:35:31/You must not accept any ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves death; they must surely be put to death.
4:35:32/You must not accept a ransom for someone who has fled to their city of refuge, allowing them to return home before the death of the high priest.
4:35:33/Do not defile the land where you live, for bloodshed defiles the land, and no atonement can be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
4:35:34/Therefore, do not pollute the land in which you live, where I myself dwell, for I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.
4:36:1/The leading heads of the families of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the descendants of Joseph, approached and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the families of Israel:
4:36:2/They said, "The LORD instructed you to distribute the land as an inheritance by lot among the Israelites: and you were told by the LORD to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
4:36:3/If they marry men from any other tribes of Israel, their inheritance will be taken from our ancestors' inheritance and added to the inheritance of the tribe they marry into: thus, it will be removed from our allotted inheritance.
4:36:4/And when the Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe they have married into: thus, their inheritance will be taken from our fathers' tribe.
4:36:5/Moses instructed the Israelites according to the LORD's command, saying, "The tribe of Joseph's descendants has spoken correctly.
4:36:6/This is what the LORD commands regarding Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry whoever they wish; but they must marry within the family of their father's tribe.
4:36:7/This way, the inheritance among the Israelites will not shift from one tribe to another: for each Israelite must maintain the inheritance of his ancestors' tribe.
4:36:8/And any daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone from her father's tribal family, so that each Israelite can keep the inheritance of his ancestors.
4:36:9/The inheritance must not transfer from one tribe to another; instead, each of the Israelite tribes must keep to its own inheritance.
4:36:10/Just as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
4:36:11/Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married their cousins on their father's side:
4:36:12/They married into the families of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's family tribe.
4:36:13/These are the commands and laws the LORD gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho.
5:1:1/These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of the Jordan River in the wilderness, in the plain opposite the Red Sea, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
5:1:2/It takes eleven days to travel from Horeb to Kadeshbarnea by the Mount Seir route.
5:1:3/In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses addressed the Israelites, following all the instructions the LORD had given him for them.
5:1:4/This was after he had defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
5:1:5/While in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying,
5:1:6/The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
5:1:7/Turn and set out on your journey. Go to the Amorite hills and to all the neighboring regions—the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, and the coastal plain. Go to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.
5:1:8/Look, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the LORD swore he would give to your ancestors—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.'
5:1:9/At that time, I said to you, 'I can't manage you by myself.
5:1:10/The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
5:1:11/May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!
5:1:12/But how can I bear your problems, your burdens, and your disputes all by myself?
5:1:13/Choose some wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.'
5:1:14/You agreed to my suggestion and said, 'It's a good idea to do this.'
5:1:15/So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected individuals, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, of tens, and as tribal officials.
5:1:16/And I instructed your judges at that time, 'Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you.
5:1:17/Do not show partiality in judgment; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.'
5:1:18/At that time, I told you everything you were to do.
5:1:19/Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, and we reached Kadesh Barnea.
5:1:20/Then I said to you, 'You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
5:1:21/See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.'
5:1:22/Then all of you came to me and said, 'Let's send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the cities we will come to.'
5:1:23/The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.
5:1:24/They left and went up into the hills, came to the Valley of Eshcol, and explored it.
5:1:25/Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, 'It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.'
5:1:26/But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
5:1:27/You grumbled in your tents and said, 'The LORD must hate us; that's why he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.
5:1:28/Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, "The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there."'
5:1:29/Then I said to you, 'Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.
5:1:30/The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,
5:1:31/and in the wilderness. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.'
5:1:32/In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,
5:1:33/who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.
5:1:34/When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:
5:1:35/'No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,
5:1:36/except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD completely.'
5:1:37/Because of you, the LORD became angry with me also and said, 'You shall not enter it, either.
5:1:38/But Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.
5:1:39/And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.
5:1:40/But as for you, turn back and take your journey into the wilderness toward the Red Sea.'
5:1:41/Then you replied, 'We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us.' So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.
5:1:42/But the LORD said to me, 'Tell them, "Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies."'
5:1:43/So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD's command and in your arrogance went up into the hill country.
5:1:44/The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.
5:1:45/You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.
5:1:46/And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.
5:2:1/Then we turned and began our journey into the wilderness, heading towards the Red Sea as the LORD instructed me. We traveled around Mount Seir for many days.
5:2:2/And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
5:2:3/"You have traveled around this mountain long enough. Now head north."
5:2:4/Tell the people, 'You will pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so be very careful.
5:2:5/Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to set your foot on. I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his inheritance.'
5:2:6/You must buy food from them with money so you can eat, and also buy water from them with money so you can drink.
5:2:7/For the LORD your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. For forty years, the LORD your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.'
5:2:8/So we bypassed our relatives, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir. We traveled along the road from Elath and Eziongaber, then we turned and traveled through the wilderness of Moab.
5:2:9/Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as an inheritance. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.'
5:2:10/Long ago, the Emim lived there, a people great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim.
5:2:11/They were also considered giants like the Anakim, but the Moabites called them Emim.
5:2:12/Before that, the Horites lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroyed them, and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land of their possession, which the LORD gave them.
5:2:13/'Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.' So we crossed the Zered Valley.
5:2:14/The time from when we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
5:2:15/Indeed, the LORD's hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp until they were all gone.
5:2:16/So when all the men of fighting age had died,
5:2:17/the LORD said to me,
5:2:18/'Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.
5:2:19/When you approach the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession; I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.'
5:2:20/(That was also considered a land of giants; giants formerly lived there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
5:2:21/a people great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. But the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, who then settled in their place,
5:2:22/just as he did for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.
5:2:23/And the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)
5:2:24/'Get up, take your journey, and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.
5:2:25/Today I will start to put the fear and dread of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and tremble and be in anguish because of you.'
5:2:26/I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with a peaceful proposal, saying,
5:2:27/'Let me pass through your land. I will stick to the main road; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
5:2:28/Sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink. I only want to pass through on foot,
5:2:29/as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.'
5:2:30/But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.
5:2:31/And the LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Start to take possession of his land.'
5:2:32/Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz.
5:2:33/And the LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him, his sons, and all his people.
5:2:34/At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed the men, women, and children of every city. We left no survivors.
5:2:35/We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, along with the spoils of the cities we had captured.
5:2:36/From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, and from the city in the gorge, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us. The LORD our God gave all of them into our hands.
5:2:37/But you did not approach the land of the Ammonites, any area along the Jabbok River, or the cities in the hills, or any place the LORD our God had forbidden us.
5:3:1/Then we turned and headed towards Bashan. Og, the king of Bashan, came out to fight us with all his people at Edrei.
5:3:2/And the LORD told me, "Don't be afraid of him: for I will hand him over to you, along with all his people and his land; and you shall deal with him as you did with Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon."
5:3:3/So the LORD our God handed Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people over to us. We defeated him until no one was left.
5:3:4/We captured all his cities at that time, not leaving a single one. We took sixty cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
5:3:5/All these cities had high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great number of towns without walls.
5:3:6/We completely destroyed them, just as we did with Sihon, king of Heshbon, annihilating every man, woman, and child in every city.
5:3:7/But we took all the livestock and the spoils of the cities for ourselves.
5:3:8/And at that time, we took the land from the two Amorite kings that was on this side of the Jordan, from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon;
5:3:9/(Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians and Shenir by the Amorites.)
5:3:10/We took all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan, up to Salcah and Edrei, cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
5:3:11/Og, king of Bashan, was the last of the giant kings. His iron bed was nine cubits long and four cubits wide, by the standard cubit.
5:3:12/And the land we took at that time, from Aroer by the Arnon River, half of Mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites.
5:3:13/The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. This included all the region of Argob in Bashan, which was known as the land of the giants.
5:3:14/Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the borders of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and named the villages after himself, Havvoth Jair, as they are called to this day.
5:3:15/And I gave Gilead to Machir.
5:3:16/To the Reubenites and Gadites, I gave the territory from Gilead down to the Arnon River, with the middle of the valley as a border, and as far as the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites.
5:3:17/The plains also, along with the Jordan and the surrounding area, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah to the east.
5:3:18/And I commanded you at that time, saying, "The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. You must cross over armed ahead of your fellow Israelites, all the warriors.
5:3:19/But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know you have a lot of livestock) should stay in the cities I've given you,
5:3:20/until the LORD gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken possession of the land the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may return to the possession I have given you."
5:3:21/And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
5:3:22/Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God himself will fight for you."
5:3:23/And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,
5:3:24/"O Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?
5:3:25/Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that beautiful hill country, and Lebanon."
5:3:26/But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. The LORD said to me, "Enough from you; do not speak to me about this matter again.
5:3:27/Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east. View the land with your own eyes, since you will not cross this Jordan.
5:3:28/But commission Joshua, encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and will enable them to inherit the land you will see."
5:3:29/So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
5:4:1/So now, listen up, Israel, to the laws and rules I'm teaching you. Follow them so you can live, and enter and take over the land the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.
5:4:2/Don't add anything to what I command you, and don't take anything away from it. Stick to the commands of the LORD your God that I'm giving you.
5:4:3/You've seen for yourselves what the LORD did about Baalpeor: the LORD your God wiped out everyone who followed Baalpeor from among you.
5:4:4/But those of you who stayed loyal to the LORD your God are all still alive today.
5:4:5/Look, I've taught you laws and rules, just as the LORD my God commanded me. You should follow them in the land you're about to enter and take over.
5:4:6/So keep them and follow them, because that will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations. They'll hear about all these laws and say, 'This great nation is surely wise and understanding.'
5:4:7/What great nation is there that has a god as close to them as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call on him?
5:4:8/And what great nation has laws and rules as righteous as this entire law I'm setting before you today?
5:4:9/Just be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you don't forget the things your eyes have seen, and so they don't slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.
5:4:10/Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 'Gather the people to me, and I will let them hear my words, so they may learn to revere me all the days they live on the earth, and may teach their children.'
5:4:11/You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire up to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.
5:4:12/Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
5:4:13/He announced his covenant to you, which he commanded you to follow, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two stone tablets.
5:4:14/At that time, the LORD commanded me to teach you laws and rules for you to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
5:4:15/So watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire.
5:4:16/Be careful not to corrupt yourselves by making an idol in the form of any figure, not male or female,
5:4:17/not any animal on the earth, any bird that flies in the air,
5:4:18/not any creature that moves along the ground, or any fish in the waters below.
5:4:19/And be careful not to look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon, the stars—all the heavenly array—and be drawn away to worship and serve them, which the LORD your God has allotted to all the nations under heaven.
5:4:20/But you, the LORD has taken and brought out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be his people, an inheritance, as you are today.
5:4:21/The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5:4:22/I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan, but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.
5:4:23/Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden.
5:4:24/For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
5:4:25/When you have children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time, if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and arousing his anger,
5:4:26/I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will be totally destroyed.
5:4:27/The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you.
5:4:28/There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
5:4:29/But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
5:4:30/When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and obey him.
5:4:31/For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath.
5:4:32/Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?
5:4:33/Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?
5:4:34/Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by tests, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
5:4:35/You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other.
5:4:36/From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.
5:4:37/Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,
5:4:38/to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.
5:4:39/Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.
5:4:40/Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the LORD your God gives you for all time.
5:4:41/Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan,
5:4:42/to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed their neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee to one of these cities and save their life.
5:4:43/The cities were Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
5:4:44/This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.
5:4:45/These are the stipulations, decrees, and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt
5:4:46/and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt.
5:4:47/They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.
5:4:48/This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Siyon (that is, Hermon),
5:4:49/and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
5:5:1/Moses gathered all of Israel and said, "Listen, Israel, to the laws and rules I'm telling you today. Learn them, follow them, and put them into practice.
5:5:2/The LORD our God established a covenant with us at Horeb.
5:5:3/This covenant wasn't made with our ancestors, but with us, all of us who are alive here today.
5:5:4/The LORD spoke to you directly at the mountain from within the fire.
5:5:5/(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to relay the LORD's words to you because you were afraid of the fire and didn't go up the mountain.) He said,
5:5:6/"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
5:5:7/You must not have any other gods besides me.
5:5:8/Do not make for yourself any carved image or any representation of anything in heaven above, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters below.
5:5:9/Do not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
5:5:10/But showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
5:5:11/Do not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
5:5:12/Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
5:5:13/Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
5:5:14/But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey, or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest as you do.
5:5:15/Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
5:5:16/Respect your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
5:5:17/Do not murder.
5:5:18/Do not commit adultery.
5:5:19/Do not steal.
5:5:20/Do not give false testimony against your neighbor.
5:5:21/Do not covet your neighbor's wife. Do not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
5:5:22/The LORD spoke these words to your entire assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness, with a loud voice, and added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
5:5:23/When you heard the voice from the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders approached me,
5:5:24/And you said, "The LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them.
5:5:25/But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer.
5:5:26/For who among all living beings has heard the voice of the living God speaking from fire, as we have, and survived?
5:5:27/Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then tell us everything the LORD our God tells you, and we will listen and obey."
5:5:28/The LORD heard your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, "I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all they have spoken.
5:5:29/If only they had such a heart in them to fear me and keep all my commandments always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!
5:5:30/Go, tell them to return to their tents.
5:5:31/But you stay here with me, and I will tell you all the commandments, statutes, and judgments you are to teach them, so they can follow them in the land I am giving them to possess."
5:5:32/Be careful to follow what the LORD your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.
5:5:33/Walk in all the ways the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land you will possess.
5:6:1/Here are the commandments, laws, and rules that the LORD your God has directed me to teach you, so you can follow them in the land you're about to enter and possess.
5:6:2/So that you, your children, and their children after them may fear the LORD your God and keep all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.
5:6:3/Listen, Israel, and be careful to obey so that things go well with you and you increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you.
5:6:4/Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.
5:6:5/You must love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
5:6:6/Keep these words I command you today deep within your heart.
5:6:7/Teach them diligently to your children. Talk about them when you're at home or walking along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
5:6:8/Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
5:6:9/Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
5:6:10/When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build,
5:6:11/houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied,
5:6:12/be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
5:6:13/Fear the LORD your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name.
5:6:14/Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;
5:6:15/for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger may burn against you and destroy you from the face of the land.
5:6:16/Do not test the LORD your God as you did at Massah.
5:6:17/Be sure to keep the commands of the LORD your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you.
5:6:18/Do what is right and good in the LORD's sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the LORD promised on oath to your ancestors,
5:6:19/thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the LORD said.
5:6:20/When your son asks you in the future, 'What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the LORD our God has commanded you?'
5:6:21/tell him, 'We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
5:6:22/Before our eyes, the LORD sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household.
5:6:23/He brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors.
5:6:24/The LORD commanded us to follow all these decrees, to fear the LORD our God, for our lasting good and to keep us alive, as is the case today.
5:6:25/It will be considered righteousness for us if we are careful to obey all these commands before the LORD our God, just as he has commanded us.
5:7:1/When the LORD your God brings you into the land you're going to take over, and has driven out many nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you;
5:7:2/And when the LORD your God hands them over to you, you must defeat them completely. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy.
5:7:3/Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons.
5:7:4/Because they will lead your sons away from following me to serve other gods, and the LORD's anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you.
5:7:5/This is how you are to deal with them: demolish their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their idols in the fire.
5:7:6/For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.
5:7:7/The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
5:7:8/But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
5:7:9/Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments.
5:7:10/And he repays those who hate him to their face, by destroying them. He will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
5:7:11/Therefore, keep the commands, decrees, and laws I am giving you today, and follow them.
5:7:12/If you pay attention to these laws and carefully follow them, then the LORD your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors.
5:7:13/He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.
5:7:14/You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young.
5:7:15/The LORD will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you.
5:7:16/You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a trap to you.
5:7:17/If you say to yourself, 'These nations are stronger than I am; how can I drive them out?'
5:7:18/Do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
5:7:19/Remember the great trials you saw, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.
5:7:20/Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished.
5:7:21/Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.
5:7:22/The LORD your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you.
5:7:23/But the LORD your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
5:7:24/He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.
5:7:25/You must burn the carved images of their gods with fire. Do not covet the silver or gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God.
5:7:26/Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
5:8:1/All the commands I give you today must be followed so that you may live, increase in number, and enter and take over the land the LORD promised to your ancestors.
5:8:2/Remember the journey the LORD your God has led you on for forty years in the desert, to humble you and test you, to reveal what was in your heart, whether or not you would follow his commands.
5:8:3/He humbled you, allowing you to go hungry, then fed you with manna, which was unknown to you and your ancestors, to teach you that humans do not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
5:8:4/Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
5:8:5/Keep in mind that just as a parent disciplines their child, so the LORD your God disciplines you.
5:8:6/So you must keep the commands of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and revering him.
5:8:7/For the LORD your God is bringing you into a prosperous land, a land with streams, springs, and aquifers flowing in the valleys and hills;
5:8:8/A land with wheat and barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land with olive oil and honey;
5:8:9/A land where you will eat bread without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and from whose hills you can mine copper.
5:8:10/When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.
5:8:11/Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws, and his decrees that I am giving you today.
5:8:12/Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,
5:8:13/And when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,
5:8:14/Then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
5:8:15/He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock.
5:8:16/He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you.
5:8:17/You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."
5:8:18/But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today.
5:8:19/If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.
5:8:20/Like the nations the LORD destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the LORD your God.
5:9:1/Listen, O Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of nations larger and stronger than you, with large, fortified cities that reach to the sky,
5:9:2/A people tall and mighty, the descendants of the Anakim, whom you know and have heard about, saying, 'Who can stand against the descendants of Anak?'
5:9:3/So know today that the LORD your God is the one going ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. You will drive them out and annihilate them swiftly, as the LORD has promised you.
5:9:4/Do not think in your heart, after the LORD your God has driven them out before you, 'It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land.' Instead, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you.
5:9:5/It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to fulfill the promise the LORD swore to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
5:9:6/Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people.
5:9:7/Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to anger in the wilderness. From the moment you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
5:9:8/Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to anger, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
5:9:9/When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.
5:9:10/And the LORD gave me the two stone tablets written by the finger of God. On them were all the words the LORD spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
5:9:11/At the end of forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
5:9:12/Then the LORD told me, 'Get up and go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned away from the way I commanded them; they have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf.'
5:9:13/Furthermore, the LORD said to me, 'I have seen this people, and indeed, it is a stubborn people.
5:9:14/Leave me alone so that I may destroy them and erase their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.'
5:9:15/So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
5:9:16/When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had quickly turned aside from the way the LORD had commanded you.
5:9:17/So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them before your eyes.
5:9:18/Then I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and provoking him to anger.
5:9:19/I was afraid of the anger and fierce wrath the LORD was angry enough with you to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also.
5:9:20/The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.
5:9:21/Then I took the sinful thing you had made, the calf, and burned it in the fire. I crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was reduced to dust, and I threw its dust into the stream that flowed down from the mountain.
5:9:22/At Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.
5:9:23/And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, 'Go up and take possession of the land I have given you,' you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not believe him or listen to his voice.
5:9:24/You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you.
5:9:25/So I lay prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
5:9:26/I prayed to the LORD and said, 'O Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance, whom you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
5:9:27/Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look upon the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness, or their sin,
5:9:28/Otherwise, the country from which you brought us might say, "Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness."
5:9:29/Yet they are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.
5:10:1/At that time, the LORD told me, "Carve two stone tablets like the first ones, and come up to me on the mountain. Also, make a wooden ark."
5:10:2/"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall place them in the ark."
5:10:3/So I made an ark out of acacia wood, carved two stone tablets like the first ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
5:10:4/And he wrote on the tablets, just like the first time, the ten commandments, which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me.
5:10:5/Then I turned around, came down from the mountain, and placed the tablets in the ark I had made; and there they remain, as the LORD instructed me.
5:10:6/The Israelites traveled from Beeroth of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar took over as priest.
5:10:7/From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land with abundant water streams.
5:10:8/At that time, the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve him, and to bless in his name, which continues to this day.
5:10:9/Therefore, Levi has no share or inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, just as the LORD your God promised him.
5:10:10/And I stayed on the mountain, just like the first time, for forty days and forty nights; and the LORD listened to me at that time also, and decided not to destroy you.
5:10:11/Then the LORD told me, 'Get up and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.'
5:10:12/And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to respect the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
5:10:13/To follow the commandments of the LORD and his decrees, which I am giving you today for your own good?
5:10:14/Look, the heavens and the highest heavens belong to the LORD your God, as well as the earth and everything in it.
5:10:15/But the LORD chose your ancestors to love them, and he chose their descendants after them—you above all peoples, as it is today.
5:10:16/So then, soften the hardness of your hearts and stop being stubborn.
5:10:17/For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, a great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.
5:10:18/He ensures justice for the orphan and widow, and loves the foreigner, giving them food and clothing.
5:10:19/Therefore, love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
5:10:20/You must respect the LORD your God, serve him, cling to him, and swear by his name.
5:10:21/He is your praise, and he is your God, who performed for you these great and awe-inspiring deeds that you have seen with your own eyes.
5:10:22/Your ancestors went down to Egypt as seventy people, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
5:11:1/So you must love the LORD your God, and always follow his instructions, laws, decisions, and commands.
5:11:2/Understand today: I'm not speaking to your children who haven't experienced, nor have seen, the discipline of the LORD your God, his greatness, his powerful hand, and his outstretched arm,
5:11:3/His miracles, and the deeds he performed in Egypt, against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his entire land;
5:11:4/And what he did to the Egyptian army, their horses, and chariots; how he made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them as they chased you, and how the LORD has annihilated them to this day;
5:11:5/And what he did for you in the wilderness, until you arrived at this place;
5:11:6/And what happened to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened up and swallowed them, their families, their tents, and all their possessions in the presence of all Israel;
5:11:7/But your own eyes have witnessed all the mighty deeds of the LORD that he performed.
5:11:8/Therefore, you must keep all the commands I give you today, so that you may be strong, and enter and take possession of the land you are going to occupy;
5:11:9/And so that you may live long in the land, which the LORD swore to give to your ancestors and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5:11:10/For the land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot like a vegetable garden;
5:11:11/But the land you are crossing over to possess is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven;
5:11:12/A land that the LORD your God cares for; the eyes of the LORD your God are on it from the beginning of the year to its end.
5:11:13/If you carefully listen to my commands that I'm giving you today, to love the LORD your God, and serve him with all your heart and soul,
5:11:14/Then I will send rain for your land at the right time, both autumn and spring rains, so that you can harvest your grain, new wine, and olive oil.
5:11:15/And I will provide grass in the fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied.
5:11:16/Be careful that your heart is not deceived, and you turn away and serve other gods and worship them;
5:11:17/Otherwise, the LORD's anger will flare up against you, and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the LORD is giving you.
5:11:18/Therefore, keep these words of mine in your heart and soul, and tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
5:11:19/Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
5:11:20/And write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates;
5:11:21/So that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the LORD swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth.
5:11:22/If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him—
5:11:23/Then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.
5:11:24/Every place where you set foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the river, the Euphrates River, to the western sea.
5:11:25/No one will be able to stand against you. The LORD your God, as he promised you, will put the fear and dread of you on all the land where you set foot.
5:11:26/See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
5:11:27/A blessing, if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today;
5:11:28/And a curse, if you do not obey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.
5:11:29/When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
5:11:30/Aren't they across the Jordan, westward, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, near Gilgal beside the oak of Moreh?
5:11:31/For you are to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land the LORD your God is giving you, and you will take possession of it and live there.
5:11:32/And be sure to follow all the statutes and judgments I am setting before you today.
5:12:1/These are the rules and laws you must follow in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you to own, for as long as you live on the earth.
5:12:2/You must completely destroy all the places where the nations you're going to displace worshiped their gods—on the high mountains, on the hills, and under every green tree.
5:12:3/You must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, burn their Asherah poles in the fire; you must cut down the carved images of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.
5:12:4/You must not treat the LORD your God in the same way.
5:12:5/But you must seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;
5:12:6/And there you must bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the special gifts you have promised to give, your voluntary offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
5:12:7/There in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the LORD your God has blessed you.
5:12:8/You must not do as we are doing here today, where everyone does what seems right in their own eyes.
5:12:9/Because you haven't yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you.
5:12:10/But when you cross the Jordan and settle in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you so you live in safety,
5:12:11/then to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name—there you must bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the LORD.
5:12:12/And there you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns, who have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
5:12:13/Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.
5:12:14/Only at the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings and do everything I command you.
5:12:15/However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, whatever you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.
5:12:16/But you must not eat the blood; you must pour it out on the ground like water.
5:12:17/Within your gates you may not eat the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil, the firstborn of your herds or flocks, any of your vows you make, your freewill offerings, or special gifts.
5:12:18/Instead, you must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose—you, your son and daughter, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you put your hand to.
5:12:19/Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
5:12:20/When the LORD your God expands your territory as he has promised you, and you crave meat and say, 'I would like some meat,' then you may eat as much meat as your heart desires.
5:12:21/If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his Name is too far from you, then you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much as you want.
5:12:22/Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you may eat them; both the unclean and the clean may eat.
5:12:23/But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
5:12:24/Do not eat it; you must pour it out on the ground like water.
5:12:25/Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, when you do what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
5:12:26/But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the LORD will choose.
5:12:27/Perform your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat.
5:12:28/Be sure to listen to all these words I command you, so that it may go well with you and your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God.
5:12:29/When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations you are going in to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land,
5:12:30/be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, saying, 'How did these nations serve their gods? I also want to do the same.'
5:12:31/You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.
5:12:32/See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.
5:13:1/If a prophet or someone who dreams of the future appears among you and gives you a sign or a miracle,
5:13:2/And if the sign or miracle they told you about happens, and they say, "Let's follow other gods" (gods you don't know) "and let's worship them,"
5:13:3/You must not listen to that prophet's or dreamer's words. For the LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
5:13:4/You must follow the LORD your God, respect Him, keep His commands, listen to His voice, serve Him, and hold fast to Him.
5:13:5/That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery, to make you leave the path the LORD your God commanded you to follow. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.
5:13:6/If your very close relative, your child, your spouse, or your dear friend secretly entices you, saying, "Let's go and worship other gods" (gods neither you nor your ancestors have known,
5:13:7/gods of the peoples around you, whether near you or far away from one end of the land to the other),
5:13:8/do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or protect them.
5:13:9/Instead, you must surely kill them. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people.
5:13:10/Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
5:13:11/Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again.
5:13:12/If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in
5:13:13/that wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, "Let's go and worship other gods" (gods you have not known),
5:13:14/then you must investigate, probe, and thoroughly inquire. If it is true and the matter is established that this detestable thing has been done among you,
5:13:15/you must certainly strike down the inhabitants of that town with the sword. Destroy it completely, along with everything in it, and its livestock with the sword.
5:13:16/Then gather all its plunder into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt.
5:13:17/Make sure that nothing devoted to destruction sticks to your hands, so that the LORD may turn from His fierce anger and show you mercy, have compassion on you, and increase your numbers, as He promised on oath to your ancestors,
5:13:18/when you obey the LORD your God by keeping all His commands that I am giving you today and doing what is right in His eyes.
5:14:1/You are the children of the LORD your God: do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your head for the dead.
5:14:2/For you are a holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be his special people, distinct from all the nations on the earth.
5:14:3/Do not eat anything detestable.
5:14:4/These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
5:14:5/The deer, the gazelle, the fallow deer, the wild goat, the antelope, the wild ox, and the mountain sheep.
5:14:6/And any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and chews the cud among the animals, you may eat.
5:14:7/However, you must not eat those that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof; such as the camel, the hare, and the rock badger: they chew the cud but do not have a split hoof; they are unclean for you.
5:14:8/And the pig, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean for you: you must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
5:14:9/You may eat all that live in the water: anything with fins and scales you may eat.
5:14:10/But anything in the waters that does not have fins and scales is unclean for you.
5:14:11/You may eat any clean bird.
5:14:12/But these are the ones you cannot eat: the eagle, the vulture, and the black vulture,
5:14:13/And the red kite, the falcon, and the kite of any kind,
5:14:14/Every kind of raven,
5:14:15/The owl, the nighthawk, the sea gull, and the hawk of any kind,
5:14:16/The little owl, the great owl, and the white owl,
5:14:17/And the pelican, the carrion vulture, and the cormorant,
5:14:18/And the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
5:14:19/Every flying insect is unclean for you; they must not be eaten.
5:14:20/But you may eat any clean bird.
5:14:21/Do not eat anything that dies of itself. You may give it to the foreigner residing in your towns so they can eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people to the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
5:14:22/You must surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes from the field every year.
5:14:23/And you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God, at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, the tithe of your grain, new wine and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always.
5:14:24/If the place is too far for you, so that you are unable to transport it because the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his name is too far from you, when the LORD your God has blessed you,
5:14:25/Then you shall convert it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and go to the place that the LORD your God chooses.
5:14:26/And you may spend the money on whatever your heart desires: for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for fermented drink, or for whatever your heart desires; and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household,
5:14:27/And do not neglect the Levite living in your towns, for he has no portion or inheritance with you.
5:14:28/At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store it in your towns,
5:14:29/So that the Levites (who have no portion or inheritance with you), the foreigners, the fatherless, and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
5:15:1/Every seven years, you must cancel debts.
5:15:2/This is how the cancellation is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel the loan they have given to their neighbor. They must not demand payment from their neighbor or brother, because the Lord's time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.
5:15:3/You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you.
5:15:4/However, there should be no poor among you, for the Lord will richly bless you in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance,
5:15:5/If only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.
5:15:6/For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.
5:15:7/If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward them.
5:15:8/Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need.
5:15:9/Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: 'The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,' so you are mean to the needy among you and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the Lord against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.
5:15:10/You must give to them freely without a grudging heart, and because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
5:15:11/There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.
5:15:12/If any of your fellow Israelites sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free.
5:15:13/And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed.
5:15:14/Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you.
5:15:15/Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.
5:15:16/But if your servant says to you, 'I do not want to leave you,' because they love you and your family and are well off with you,
5:15:17/then take an awl and push it through their earlobe into the door, and they will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.
5:15:18/Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you for six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired worker. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.
5:15:19/Dedicate all the firstborn males of your herds and flocks to the Lord your God. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.
5:15:20/Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose.
5:15:21/If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
5:15:22/You are to eat it within your own gates; both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.
5:15:23/But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
5:16:1/Mark the month of Abib, and celebrate Passover to honor the LORD your God, for it was in the month of Abib that the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt during the night.
5:16:2/So, you must sacrifice the Passover to the LORD your God, from your flocks and herds, at the place the LORD chooses to establish His name.
5:16:3/Do not eat any bread made with yeast during this time; for seven days, you must eat unleavened bread with it, the bread of hardship, because you left Egypt in a hurry. This is so you'll remember the day you left Egypt for as long as you live.
5:16:4/No yeast shall be seen with you in your entire territory for seven days, and none of the meat you sacrifice on the first evening should be left over until morning.
5:16:5/You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover in any of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you.
5:16:6/But at the place the LORD your God will choose to establish His name, there you shall sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt.
5:16:7/You shall cook and eat it at the place the LORD your God will choose. Then in the morning, you can go back to your tents.
5:16:8/For six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God. You shall do no work on that day.
5:16:9/Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to harvest the grain.
5:16:10/Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the LORD your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the LORD your God has given you.
5:16:11/And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your towns, and the strangers, orphans, and widows among you, at the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name.
5:16:12/Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow these decrees carefully.
5:16:13/Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce from your threshing floor and your winepress.
5:16:14/Rejoice during your festival, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows who live in your towns.
5:16:15/For seven days celebrate the festival to the LORD your God at the place the LORD will choose, for the LORD your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete.
5:16:16/Three times a year all your men must appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed.
5:16:17/Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the LORD your God has blessed you.
5:16:18/Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the LORD your God is giving you, and they shall render just decisions for the people.
5:16:19/Do not distort justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent.
5:16:20/Pursue only what is just, so that you may live and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you.
5:16:21/Do not plant any kind of tree as a sacred pole beside the altar you build to the LORD your God.
5:16:22/And do not set up any stone image to worship; the LORD your God detests them.
5:17:1/You must not offer to the LORD your God any bull or sheep that has a defect or any kind of flaw, because that would be detestable to the LORD your God.
5:17:2/If anyone, man or woman, within any of your gates that the LORD your God has given you, is found to have done evil in the eyes of the LORD your God by breaking his covenant,
5:17:3/And has gone off to serve other gods and worship them, whether the sun, moon, or any of the heavenly bodies, which I have not authorized;
5:17:4/And you hear about it, investigate thoroughly, and find it to be true and proven that such detestable acts have been committed in Israel,
5:17:5/Then you must take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gates and stone them to death.
5:17:6/A person shall be put to death on the testimony of two or three witnesses; they shall not be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
5:17:7/The witnesses must be the first to put their hands on the person to execute them, followed by the hands of all the people. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.
5:17:8/If a case is too difficult for you to judge, whether it involves homicide, conflicting claims, or assault, take it to the place the LORD your God will choose.
5:17:9/Go to the Levitical priests and the judge in office at that time; consult them, and they will give you a verdict.
5:17:10/You must act according to the verdict they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do exactly as they instruct you.
5:17:11/Follow the verdict they give you and the decision they announce to you, without turning aside to the right or to the left from what they declare to you.
5:17:12/Anyone who acts arrogantly, refusing to listen either to the priest who stands there serving the LORD your God or to the judge, must die. In this way, you will purge the evil from Israel.
5:17:13/Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act arrogantly anymore.
5:17:14/When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, 'Let's set a king over us like all the nations around us,'
5:17:15/you must certainly set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses. One of your fellow Israelites you must set as king over yourselves; you cannot set a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.
5:17:16/However, he must not acquire many horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more horses, for the LORD has told you, 'You are never to go back that way again.'
5:17:17/He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
5:17:18/When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests.
5:17:19/It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees,
5:17:20/so that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or to the left. This will ensure that he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
5:18:1/The Levite priests and the entire tribe of Levi won't have a share or inheritance with Israel: they will live on the offerings made by fire to the LORD, which are his inheritance.
5:18:2/So, they won't have an inheritance among their fellow Israelites: the LORD is their inheritance, just as he promised them.
5:18:3/This is what the priests are entitled to receive from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it's an ox or sheep; they must give the priest the shoulder, both cheeks, and the stomach.
5:18:4/You must also give him the first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the first wool from your sheep.
5:18:5/For the LORD your God has chosen him from all your tribes to serve in the LORD's name, him and his sons forever.
5:18:6/And if a Levite leaves any of your towns throughout Israel where he is living and comes with all the desire of his heart to the place the LORD will choose,
5:18:7/Then he may serve in the name of the LORD his God, just like his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD.
5:18:8/They shall have equal shares to eat, in addition to what they receive from the sale of their family possessions.
5:18:9/When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not adopt the detestable practices of those nations.
5:18:10/No one among you should sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire, practice divination, tell fortunes, practice sorcery, or cast spells.
5:18:11/Or cast spells, consult with spirits, be a medium, or consult the dead.
5:18:12/Anyone doing these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive them out before you.
5:18:13/You must be blameless before the LORD your God.
5:18:14/The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery and divination, but the LORD your God has not allowed you to do so.
5:18:15/The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites; you must listen to him.
5:18:16/Just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, 'Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.'
5:18:17/And the LORD said to me, 'What they say is good.'
5:18:18/I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.
5:18:19/If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.
5:18:20/But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or speaks in the name of other gods must be put to death.
5:18:21/If you wonder in your heart how we can recognize a message the LORD has not spoken,
5:18:22/If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be afraid of him.
5:19:1/When the LORD your God has eliminated the nations whose land the LORD your God is giving you, and you take their place and live in their cities and houses;
5:19:2/You must set aside three cities in the middle of your land, which the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
5:19:3/You must prepare roads and divide the territory of your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, into three parts, so that anyone who accidentally kills someone can flee there.
5:19:4/This applies to someone who accidentally kills their neighbor without having previously hated them;
5:19:5/For example, if someone goes into the forest with their neighbor to cut wood, and as they swing the axe to chop down a tree, the head flies off and hits their neighbor, causing death, that person can flee to one of these cities and live;
5:19:6/This is to prevent the avenger of blood from pursuing the killer in anger, catching up with them because the distance is too great, and killing them, even though they did not deserve to die because there was no prior hatred.
5:19:7/That's why I'm instructing you to set aside three cities.
5:19:8/And if the LORD your God expands your territory, as he swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land he promised to give to your ancestors;
5:19:9/If you keep all these commands I'm giving you today, to love the LORD your God and to always walk in his ways, then you must add three more cities to these three;
5:19:10/So that innocent blood is not shed in your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and so you are not guilty of bloodshed.
5:19:11/But if someone hates their neighbor, lies in wait for them, attacks, and fatally wounds them, and then flees to one of these cities;
5:19:12/The elders of their city must send for them, bring them back, and hand them over to the avenger of blood to be put to death.
5:19:13/You must show no pity; you must remove the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may go well with you.
5:19:14/You must not move your neighbor's boundary marker, set by previous generations, in the inheritance you will receive in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
5:19:15/A single witness shall not stand against someone for any wrongdoing or sin they have committed; a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
5:19:16/If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime,
5:19:17/Both parties involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD, before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time;
5:19:18/The judges must thoroughly investigate, and if the witness is found to be a liar, having falsely accused their brother;
5:19:19/Then you must do to the false witness as they intended to do to their brother. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.
5:19:20/And the rest will hear and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you.
5:19:21/Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
5:20:1/When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses, chariots, and a larger army, don't be afraid of them: for the LORD your God is with you, who brought you out of Egypt.
5:20:2/And when you're about to enter the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people,
5:20:3/And say to them, Listen, Israel, you are about to fight your enemies today: don't lose courage, don't be afraid, and don't panic because of them;
5:20:4/For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
5:20:5/And the officers shall say to the people, Is there anyone who has built a new house and hasn't dedicated it yet? He should go back home, so he doesn't die in battle and someone else dedicates it.
5:20:6/And is there anyone who has planted a vineyard and hasn't enjoyed its fruit yet? He should also go back home, so he doesn't die in battle and someone else enjoys it.
5:20:7/And is there anyone who has betrothed a wife and hasn't married her? He should go back home, so he doesn't die in battle and someone else marries her.
5:20:8/And the officers shall continue speaking to the people, saying, Is there anyone who is scared and weak-hearted? He should go back home, so he doesn't make his fellow soldiers lose courage as well.
5:20:9/And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, they shall appoint leaders to command the army.
5:20:10/When you approach a city to fight against it, first offer it peace.
5:20:11/And if it accepts your offer of peace and opens its gates to you, then all the people found there shall become your subjects and serve you.
5:20:12/But if it refuses to make peace with you and decides to fight, then you shall lay siege to it:
5:20:13/And when the LORD your God has given it into your hands, you shall kill every male with the sword:
5:20:14/But the women, children, livestock, and everything else in the city, all its spoils, you shall take for yourself; and you shall enjoy the spoils of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.
5:20:15/This is how you shall treat all the cities that are far away from you, which are not part of the nations nearby.
5:20:16/But in the cities of these nations that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall leave nothing alive that breathes:
5:20:17/But you shall completely destroy them; the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, as the LORD your God has commanded you:
5:20:18/So that they may not teach you to follow all their detestable practices that they do for their gods, causing you to sin against the LORD your God.
5:20:19/When you besiege a city for a long time, fighting to capture it, do not destroy its trees by swinging an axe against them. You can eat from them, so do not cut them down. The trees of the field are not your enemy to be used in the siege:
5:20:20/Only the trees you know are not fruit-bearing you may destroy and cut down to build siege works against the city that is fighting you, until it falls.
5:21:1/If someone is found murdered in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess, lying in the field, and it's unknown who killed them:
5:21:2/Then your elders and judges must go out and measure the distance to the towns near the body.
5:21:3/The town closest to the dead body will have its elders take a young cow that has never been worked or worn a yoke.
5:21:4/These elders must take the cow to a valley that has never been plowed or sown and break the cow's neck there.
5:21:5/The priests, the sons of Levi, shall approach because the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of the LORD; and their decision will settle every dispute and assault.
5:21:6/All the elders of the town nearest to the murdered person must wash their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the valley,
5:21:7/And they shall declare, 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.
5:21:8/Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and do not hold the guilt of innocent blood against your people Israel.' And the guilt of the blood will be forgiven.
5:21:9/In this way, you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you by doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
5:21:10/When you go to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take them captive,
5:21:11/And you see among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, wishing to take her as your wife,
5:21:12/Then you must bring her into your home, where she will shave her head, trim her nails,
5:21:13/And she will remove her captive's attire and stay in your house, mourning her father and mother for a full month. After that, you may go to her and be her husband, and she will be your wife.
5:21:14/If you are not pleased with her, you must let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her for money or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
5:21:15/If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him children, but the firstborn son belongs to the unloved wife,
5:21:16/Then on the day he wills his possessions to his sons, he cannot favor the son of the loved wife over the firstborn son of the unloved wife.
5:21:17/He must recognize the firstborn son of the unloved wife by giving him a double share of all he has, for that son is the first sign of his father's strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
5:21:18/If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and does not listen to them even after they discipline him,
5:21:19/His father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.
5:21:20/They shall say to the elders, 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.'
5:21:21/Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.
5:21:22/If a man commits a crime punishable by death and is executed, and you hang his body on a tree,
5:21:23/You must not leave his body on the tree overnight. Be sure to bury him that same day, because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not defile the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5:22:1/You must not see your brother's ox or sheep stray and ignore them: you must definitely bring them back to your brother.
5:22:2/And if your brother is not nearby, or if you do not know him, then you must take it to your own house, and it shall stay with you until your brother looks for it, and you must return it to him.
5:22:3/Similarly, you must do with his donkey; and so you must do with his clothes; and with any lost item of your brother's, which he has lost and you have found, you must do the same: you cannot ignore it.
5:22:4/You must not see your brother's donkey or his ox fall down on the road and ignore them: you must definitely help him lift them up again.
5:22:5/Women shall not wear men's clothing, nor shall men wear women's clothing: for all who do so are detestable to the LORD your God.
5:22:6/If you come across a bird's nest in your path in any tree, or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you must not take the mother with the young.
5:22:7/But you must definitely let the mother go, and take the young for yourself; so that things may go well with you, and you may have a long life.
5:22:8/When you build a new house, you must make a parapet for your roof, so you do not bring guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from it.
5:22:9/You must not plant your vineyard with two kinds of seeds: otherwise, the produce of the seed you have sown and the fruit of your vineyard will be defiled.
5:22:10/You must not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
5:22:11/You must not wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.
5:22:12/You must make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
5:22:13/If a man marries a woman, has sexual relations with her, and then dislikes her,
5:22:14/And he makes accusations against her and tarnishes her reputation by saying, "I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find her to be a virgin,"
5:22:15/Then the woman's father and mother must bring proof of the woman's virginity to the elders at the city gate.
5:22:16/And the woman's father must say to the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man as wife, but he dislikes her;
5:22:17/And now he has made accusations against her, saying, 'I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.' But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity." And they will display the cloth before the elders of the city.
5:22:18/And the elders of that city shall take the man and punish him;
5:22:19/And they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the woman, because he has brought a bad name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall remain his wife; he cannot divorce her all his days.
5:22:20/But if the accusation is true, and evidence of the woman's virginity is not found,
5:22:21/Then they shall bring the woman to the entrance of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed an outrageous act in Israel by being promiscuous while living in her father's house. Thus, you shall purge the evil from among you.
5:22:22/If a man is found sleeping with a married woman, then both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. In this way, you shall remove evil from Israel.
5:22:23/If a betrothed virgin is seduced in the city and a man sleeps with her,
5:22:24/Then you must take both of them to the gate of that city and stone them to death; the woman because she did not cry out for help in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor's fiancée. In this way, you shall remove evil from among you.
5:22:25/But if a man encounters a betrothed woman in the countryside, and he forces her and sleeps with her, then only the man who slept with her shall die.
5:22:26/But you shall do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone attacking and murdering a neighbor;
5:22:27/For he found her in the countryside, and the betrothed woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.
5:22:28/If a man finds a virgin who is not betrothed, and he seizes her, lies with her, and they are discovered,
5:22:29/Then the man who lay with her must give the woman's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall become his wife because he has violated her; he cannot divorce her all his days.
5:22:30/A man must not marry his father's wife, so that he does not dishonor his father's bed.
5:23:1/Anyone who is castrated or has their genitals mutilated cannot join the assembly of the LORD.
5:23:2/A person born out of wedlock shall not join the assembly of the LORD; even up to the tenth generation, they shall not enter the assembly of the LORD.
5:23:3/An Ammonite or Moabite shall not join the assembly of the LORD; even up to their tenth generation, they shall never join the assembly of the LORD.
5:23:4/Because they did not meet you with food and water on your journey out of Egypt; and because they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Mesopotamia to curse you.
5:23:5/However, the LORD your God refused to listen to Balaam; instead, the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you.
5:23:6/Do not seek their peace or their prosperity for as long as you live.
5:23:7/Do not despise an Edomite, for they are your relative; do not despise an Egyptian, because you were a foreigner in their country.
5:23:8/Children born to them may join the assembly of the LORD in the third generation.
5:23:9/When you go out to battle against your enemies, keep away from anything evil.
5:23:10/If anyone among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, they must go outside the camp and cannot reenter the camp.
5:23:11/But as evening approaches, they must wash themselves with water, and at sunset, they may reenter the camp.
5:23:12/You must have a designated place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself.
5:23:13/Carry a tool with your equipment so that when you relieve yourself outside, you can dig a hole and cover up your excrement.
5:23:14/For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so he does not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.
5:23:15/Do not hand over to their master a slave who has escaped from their master to you.
5:23:16/They shall live among you, in any place they choose within one of your towns, wherever they like. Do not mistreat them.
5:23:17/There must be no prostitutes among the daughters of Israel, nor any male prostitutes among the sons of Israel.
5:23:18/Do not bring the earnings of a prostitute or the money from the sale of a dog to the house of the LORD your God for any vow, for both of these are detestable to the LORD your God.
5:23:19/Do not charge your fellow Israelites interest, whether on money, food, or anything else that may earn interest.
5:23:20/You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess.
5:23:21/When you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not delay in fulfilling it. The LORD your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin.
5:23:22/But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty.
5:23:23/Whatever you have promised with your lips you must surely fulfill, just as you have freely vowed to the LORD your God with your own mouth.
5:23:24/When you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat grapes to your heart's content, but do not put any in your basket.
5:23:25/When you enter your neighbor's standing grain, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to their standing grain.
5:24:1/When a man has married a woman, and then finds she does not please him because he has discovered something objectionable about her, he can write her a divorce certificate, hand it to her, and send her away from his house.
5:24:2/After she leaves his house, she is free to become another man's wife.
5:24:3/If her next husband dislikes her and writes her a divorce certificate, gives it to her, and sends her away from his house; or if the next husband dies after marrying her;
5:24:4/Her first husband, who divorced her, cannot marry her again after she has been with another man. This is detestable in the eyes of the LORD. Do not bring sin upon the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5:24:5/When a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year, he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.
5:24:6/No one should take a millstone or even an upper millstone as security for a loan, because that would be taking someone's livelihood as security.
5:24:7/If someone is caught kidnapping a fellow Israelite, enslaving them or selling them, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.
5:24:8/Be very careful to follow all instructions regarding the disease of leprosy, exactly as the Levitical priests instruct you. As I have commanded them, so you must follow.
5:24:9/Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the way after you came out of Egypt.
5:24:10/When you lend something to your neighbor, do not go into their house to collect the collateral.
5:24:11/You must wait outside, and the person you are lending to will bring the collateral to you.
5:24:12/If the borrower is poor, do not sleep with their collateral.
5:24:13/You must certainly return the collateral to the borrower at sunset so they can sleep in their own clothes and bless you. It will be considered a righteous act in the eyes of the LORD your God.
5:24:14/Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether they are a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns.
5:24:15/Pay them their wages on the same day, before the sun sets, because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise, they may cry to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
5:24:16/Parents should not be put to death for their children's sins, nor children for their parents'. Each person should be put to death for their own sin.
5:24:17/Do not deny justice to a foreigner or an orphan, nor take a widow's garment as security for a loan.
5:24:18/But remember that you were a slave in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you from there. That is why I command you to do this.
5:24:19/When you harvest your crops and forget a sheaf in the field, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
5:24:20/When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.
5:24:21/When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not glean what is left. Leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.
5:24:22/And remember that you were a slave in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.
5:25:1/If there is a dispute between people, and they go to court for a judgment, the judges will decide the case; they will clear the innocent and condemn the guilty.
5:25:2/And if the guilty person deserves to be flogged, the judge will make him lie down and have him whipped in his presence, according to his crime, with a specified number of lashes.
5:25:3/He may be given up to forty lashes but no more, so that if he is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite would be degraded in your eyes.
5:25:4/Do not prevent the ox from eating as it treads out the grain.
5:25:5/If brothers live together and one of them dies without having a child, the widow should not marry someone outside the family. Her husband's brother should marry her, fulfilling the duty of a brother-in-law.
5:25:6/The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be forgotten in Israel.
5:25:7/But if the man does not want to marry his brother's widow, she should go to the elders at the town gate and say, 'My husband's brother refuses to preserve his brother's name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me.'
5:25:8/Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he insists, saying, 'I do not want to marry her,'
5:25:9/his brother's widow shall approach him in the presence of the elders, remove one of his sandals, spit in his face, and declare, 'This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brother's family.'
5:25:10/And his name shall be known in Israel as 'The House of the Unshod.'
5:25:11/When men fight each other, and the wife of one intervenes to save her husband from the one attacking him, and she reaches out and grabs him by the genitals,
5:25:12/you must cut off her hand without pity.
5:25:13/You must not have differing weights in your bag—one heavy, one light.
5:25:14/You must not have differing measures in your house—one large, one small.
5:25:15/You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
5:25:16/For anyone who does these wrong things, anyone who acts unjustly, is detestable to the LORD your God.
5:25:17/Remember what Amalek did to you on your journey after you left Egypt,
5:25:18/how he attacked you when you were exhausted and weary, targeting those who were lagging behind and not fearing God.
5:25:19/Therefore, when the LORD your God gives you peace from all your surrounding enemies in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you must erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget.
5:26:1/When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and live there;
5:26:2/you must take some of the first produce from your soil, which you harvest from your land that the LORD your God is giving you, put it in a basket, and go to the place the LORD your God will choose to establish his name.
5:26:3/You must go to the priest in office at that time and say to him, 'Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have entered the land the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.'
5:26:4/The priest will then take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the LORD your God.
5:26:5/You shall then declare before the LORD your God, 'My ancestor was a wandering Aramean, who went down to Egypt and lived there with a few people, but there he became a great, powerful, and populous nation.
5:26:6/The Egyptians mistreated us, made us suffer, and imposed harsh slavery on us.
5:26:7/But when we cried out to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, the LORD heard our plea and saw our hardship, toil, and oppression.
5:26:8/So the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, with terrifying power, and with signs and wonders.
5:26:9/He has brought us to this place and given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5:26:10/And now, here I am, bringing the first fruits of the land you, LORD, have given me.' You shall place it before the LORD your God and bow down before him.
5:26:11/Then you and your household shall rejoice in all the good things the LORD your God has given to you and your household, along with the Levites and the foreigners living among you.
5:26:12/When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.
5:26:13/Then say before the LORD your God, 'I have removed the sacred portion from my house and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all your commands. I have not violated or forgotten your commands.
5:26:14/I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the LORD my God; I have done everything you commanded me.
5:26:15/Look down from your holy dwelling, from heaven, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us, as you swore to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5:26:16/Today the LORD your God commands you to follow these decrees and laws; carefully observe them with all your heart and with all your soul.
5:26:17/You have declared today that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in his ways, keep his decrees, commands, and laws, and listen to his voice.
5:26:18/And the LORD has declared today that you are his treasured people, as he promised, and that you are to keep all his commands.
5:26:19/He has promised to set you in praise, fame, and honor high above all the nations he has made and that you will be a people holy to the LORD your God, as he has spoken.
5:27:1/Moses and the elders of Israel instructed the people, saying, "Follow all the commands I give you today."
5:27:2/On the day you cross the Jordan into the land the LORD your God is giving you, you must set up large stones and cover them with plaster.
5:27:3/Write all the words of this law on them after you have crossed over, so that you may enter the land the LORD your God is giving you—a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you.
5:27:4/So when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones, as I command you today, on Mount Ebal, and cover them with plaster.
5:27:5/There you shall build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them.
5:27:6/You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones, and you shall offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God.
5:27:7/You shall offer peace offerings and shall eat there, rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.
5:27:8/Write all the words of this law on the stones clearly and distinctly.
5:27:9/Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, "Be attentive and listen, Israel. Today you have become the people of the LORD your God."
5:27:10/Therefore, listen to the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes that I command you today.
5:27:11/Moses gave the people these instructions on that day, saying,
5:27:12/These tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have crossed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
5:27:13/And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
5:27:14/The Levites shall proclaim in a loud voice to all the men of Israel,
5:27:15/"Cursed is anyone who makes an idol or a molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of a craftsman's hands, and sets it up in secret." And all the people shall respond by saying, "Amen."
5:27:16/"Cursed is anyone who dishonors their father or mother." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:17/"Cursed is anyone who moves their neighbor's boundary stone." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:18/"Cursed is anyone who leads a blind person astray on the road." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:19/"Cursed is anyone who denies justice to foreigners, orphans, and widows." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:20/"Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his father's wife, for he violates his father's marriage." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:21/"Cursed is anyone who has sexual relations with any animal." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:22/"Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his sister, whether she is the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:23/"Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his mother-in-law." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:24/"Cursed is anyone who attacks their neighbor in secret." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:25/"Cursed is anyone who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:27:26/"Cursed is anyone who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out." And all the people shall say, "Amen."
5:28:1/It will happen that if you listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and follow all his commands that I give you today, the LORD your God will elevate you above all nations on earth.
5:28:2/All these blessings will come to you and overtake you, if you listen to the voice of the LORD your God.
5:28:3/You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the field.
5:28:4/Your children, your crops, and your livestock, including the increase of your herds and the flocks of your sheep, will be blessed.
5:28:5/Your basket and your pantry will be blessed.
5:28:6/You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.
5:28:7/The LORD will defeat your enemies who rise against you; they will attack from one direction but flee from you in seven.
5:28:8/The LORD will bless your storerooms and all the work of your hands, and he will bless you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
5:28:9/The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways.
5:28:10/Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you.
5:28:11/The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity—in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock, and the crops of your ground—in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.
5:28:12/The LORD will open the heavens, his bountiful storehouse, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.
5:28:13/The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.
5:28:14/Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them.
5:28:15/However, if you do not listen to the voice of the LORD your God and do not carry out all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:
5:28:16/You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the field.
5:28:17/Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
5:28:18/The fruit of your womb, the crops of your land, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks will be cursed.
5:28:19/You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
5:28:20/The LORD will send on you curses, confusion, and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.
5:28:21/The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has eliminated you from the land you are entering to possess.
5:28:22/The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish.
5:28:23/The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron.
5:28:24/The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed.
5:28:25/The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.
5:28:26/Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away.
5:28:27/The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.
5:28:28/The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind.
5:28:29/At midday you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you.
5:28:30/You will be engaged to a woman, but another man will sleep with her. You will build a house, but you won't live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you won't harvest its grapes.
5:28:31/Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, with no one to rescue them.
5:28:32/Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and your eyes will wear out watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand.
5:28:33/A nation you do not know will eat the fruit of your land and the labor of your hands. You will be only oppressed and crushed continually.
5:28:34/You will be driven mad by the sights you see.
5:28:35/The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
5:28:36/The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone.
5:28:37/You will become a thing of horror, a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the LORD will drive you.
5:28:38/You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it.
5:28:39/You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.
5:28:40/You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off.
5:28:41/You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity.
5:28:42/Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land.
5:28:43/The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower.
5:28:44/They will lend to you, but you will not lend to them. They will be the head, but you will be the tail.
5:28:45/All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and keep the commands and decrees he gave you.
5:28:46/They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.
5:28:47/Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity,
5:28:48/therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.
5:28:49/The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,
5:28:50/a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.
5:28:51/They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.
5:28:52/They will lay siege to all your cities until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted fall throughout your land. They will besiege all your cities throughout the land the LORD your God has given you.
5:28:53/You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you, during the siege and distress your enemies inflict on you.
5:28:54/The most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother, his beloved wife, and his surviving children,
5:28:55/refusing to share with them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the severe distress your enemy will inflict on all your cities.
5:28:56/The most gentle and sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son and daughter,
5:28:57/the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and distress your enemy will inflict on you in your cities.
5:28:58/If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the LORD your God—
5:28:59/the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses.
5:28:60/He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you.
5:28:61/Also every sickness and every plague not recorded in this Book of the Law, the LORD will bring on you until you are destroyed.
5:28:62/You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God.
5:28:63/Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
5:28:64/The LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods—gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known.
5:28:65/Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.
5:28:66/You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.
5:28:67/In the morning you will say, "If only it were evening!" and in the evening, "If only it were morning!"—because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.
5:28:68/The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
5:29:1/These are the words of the agreement, which the LORD instructed Moses to establish with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the agreement he had made with them at Horeb.
5:29:2/And Moses gathered all Israel and said to them, "You have witnessed everything the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, his officials, and his land;
5:29:3/The significant trials you saw with your own eyes, the signs, and those incredible miracles:
5:29:4/Yet, the LORD hasn't given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear, up to this very day.
5:29:5/I have led you for forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not worn out on you, and your shoe has not worn out on your foot.
5:29:6/You haven't eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink: so you might know that I am the LORD your God.
5:29:7/And when you arrived at this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out to fight against us, and we defeated them:
5:29:8/And we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.
5:29:9/Therefore, keep the words of this agreement and follow them, so you may thrive in everything you do.
5:29:10/Today, all of you stand before the LORD your God; your leaders, your elders, and your officials, along with all the men of Israel,
5:29:11/Your children, your wives, and the foreigner in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water:
5:29:12/So that you may enter into an agreement with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God is making with you today:
5:29:13/So that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he has told you, and as he has sworn to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
5:29:14/It's not just with you that I am making this agreement and this oath;
5:29:15/But also with anyone standing here with us today before the LORD our God, and also with anyone who is not here with us today:
5:29:16/(For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt; and how we traveled through the nations you passed by;
5:29:17/And you have seen their detestable practices, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
5:29:18/So that there won't be among you any man, woman, family, or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; so there won't be among you a root that produces poison and bitterness;
5:29:19/And it happens that when he hears the words of this curse, he blesses himself in his heart, saying, 'I will have peace, even though I follow the stubbornness of my heart,' leading to the addition of drunkenness to thirst:
5:29:20/The LORD will not forgive him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy will burn against that person, and all the curses written in this book will rest on him, and the LORD will erase his name from under heaven.
5:29:21/And the LORD will set him apart for disaster from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the agreement written in this book of the law:
5:29:22/So that the future generation, your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it;
5:29:23/And that the whole land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there, like the destruction of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and wrath:
5:29:24/Then all nations will ask, 'Why has the LORD done this to this land? What caused the heat of this great anger?'
5:29:25/Then people will say, 'It's because they abandoned the agreement of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:
5:29:26/For they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods they did not know and that he had not allotted to them:
5:29:27/And the anger of the LORD was ignited against this land, to bring upon it all the curses written in this book:
5:29:28/And the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger, wrath, and great indignation, and threw them into another land, as it is today.
5:29:29/The secret things belong to the LORD our God: but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.
5:30:1/When all these things happen to you—the blessings and the curses I've laid out before you—and you remember them in all the nations where the LORD your God has sent you,
5:30:2/And you return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice with all your heart and soul, just as I'm commanding you today, you and your children,
5:30:3/Then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes, show you mercy, and gather you again from all the nations where He has scattered you.
5:30:4/Even if you've been exiled to the farthest horizon, the LORD your God will gather you from there and bring you back.
5:30:5/The LORD your God will bring you into the land your ancestors owned, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.
5:30:6/The LORD your God will soften your heart and the hearts of your descendants, so that you love the LORD your God with all your heart and soul, and so you may live.
5:30:7/The LORD your God will place all these curses on your foes and those who hate and persecute you.
5:30:8/You will return and listen to the voice of the LORD and follow all His commands that I'm giving you today.
5:30:9/The LORD your God will make you successful in all you do—in your children, your livestock, and your crops. The LORD will delight in making you prosperous, just as He delighted in your ancestors,
5:30:10/If you listen to the voice of the LORD your God, keeping His commandments and statutes written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.
5:30:11/This commandment I give you today is not too mysterious or out of reach.
5:30:12/It's not up in heaven, so you don't have to ask, 'Who will go up to heaven to get it for us and proclaim it to us so we can follow it?'
5:30:13/Nor is it beyond the sea, so you don't have to ask, 'Who will cross the sea to get it for us and proclaim it to us so we can follow it?'
5:30:14/No, the word is very close to you; it's in your mouth and in your heart so you can obey it.
5:30:15/See, today I've set before you life and prosperity, death and destruction.
5:30:16/For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commands, decrees, and laws; then you will live and increase, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.
5:30:17/But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
5:30:18/I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
5:30:19/Today I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live
5:30:20/And that you may love the LORD your God, listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him. For the LORD is your life, and He will give you many years in the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
5:31:1/Moses went and spoke these words to all of Israel.
5:31:2/He told them, "Today I am 120 years old; I can no longer lead you in and out. Besides, the LORD has told me, 'You will not cross the Jordan River.'"
5:31:3/"The LORD your God Himself will cross ahead of you and will destroy these nations before you so that you can take their land. Joshua will also cross ahead of you, as the LORD has said."
5:31:4/"The LORD will deal with them just as He did with Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land, which He destroyed."
5:31:5/"The LORD will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you."
5:31:6/"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you."
5:31:7/Moses called Joshua and said to him in front of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land the LORD swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance."
5:31:8/"The LORD Himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."
5:31:9/Moses wrote down this law and handed it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
5:31:10/Moses instructed them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, during the Festival of Tabernacles,
5:31:11/when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place He will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing.
5:31:12/Gather the people together—men, women, children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.
5:31:13/And so their children, who do not know this law, can hear and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."
5:31:14/The LORD said to Moses, "Your time to die is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, so I may commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
5:31:15/The LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.
5:31:16/The LORD said to Moses, "You are going to rest with your ancestors, and then this people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.
5:31:17/Then my anger will be kindled against them on that day, and I will abandon them and hide my face from them. They will be devoured, and many disasters and hardships will come upon them. They will say on that day, 'Isn't it because our God is not with us that these disasters have come upon us?'
5:31:18/And I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.
5:31:19/Now, write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites. Put it in their mouths, so this song may be a witness for me against the Israelites.
5:31:20/For when I bring them into the land I swore to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, and they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.
5:31:21/And when many disasters and hardships come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are inclined to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised."
5:31:22/So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.
5:31:23/He gave Joshua son of Nun a charge, saying, "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I swore to them, and I will be with you."
5:31:24/When Moses finished writing down the words of this law in a book to the very end,
5:31:25/Moses commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
5:31:26/"Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.
5:31:27/For I know your rebelliousness and your stiff neck. Even today, while I am still alive with you, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more after my death?
5:31:28/Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them.
5:31:29/For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn from the way I have commanded you. In the days to come, disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger by what your hands have made."
5:31:30/Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel.
5:32:1/Listen up, heavens, and I'll speak; earth, hear the words I'm saying.
5:32:2/My teaching will fall like rain, my words will settle like dew, like light rain on new grass, like showers on the green plants.
5:32:3/Because I will proclaim the name of the LORD: give greatness to our God.
5:32:4/He is the Rock, his work is flawless: all his ways are just: a God of truth and without wrongdoing, fair and upright is he.
5:32:5/They have degraded themselves, their blemish is not the mark of his children: they are a twisted and crooked generation.
5:32:6/Is this how you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Isn't he your father who acquired you? Didn't he make you and establish you?
5:32:7/Remember the ancient days, think about the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.
5:32:8/When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided humanity, he set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
5:32:9/For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the plot of land he inherits.
5:32:10/He found him in a desert land, in a howling wilderness wasteland; he encircled him, he cared for him, he guarded him as the pupil of his eye.
5:32:11/Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreads its wings to catch them, carries them on its pinions,
5:32:12/So the LORD alone led him, with no foreign god beside him.
5:32:13/He made him ride on the heights of the land, to eat the produce of the fields; he made him suck honey from the rock, and oil from the flinty crag;
5:32:14/Cream from cows, and milk from sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the choicest wheat; and you drank wine from the purest grapes.
5:32:15/But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked: you grew fat, you grew thick, you are covered with fat; then he abandoned God who made him, and discounted the Rock of his salvation.
5:32:16/They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods, with detestable practices they provoked him to anger.
5:32:17/They sacrificed to demons, not to God; to gods they had not known, to new gods that had come recently, whom your ancestors had not feared.
5:32:18/You forgot the Rock who fathered you, and forgot God who gave you birth.
5:32:19/And when the LORD saw it, he rejected them, because of the provocation of his sons and daughters.
5:32:20/And he said, 'I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children in whom there is no faithfulness.
5:32:21/They have made me jealous with what is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
5:32:22/For a fire has been kindled by my anger, and it will burn to the depths of Sheol, consume the earth and its yield, and set the foundations of the mountains on fire.
5:32:23/I will heap disasters on them; I will use up my arrows against them.
5:32:24/They will be wasted with hunger, devoured by plague and poisonous destruction; I will send the fangs of wild beasts against them, with the venom of things that crawl in the dust.
5:32:25/The sword will bring death from outside, and terror from within, destroying both the young man and the virgin, the infant and the gray-haired man.
5:32:26/I said I would scatter them and erase their memory from human existence,
5:32:27/Were it not that I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest their adversaries misunderstand and say, 'Our hand is triumphant; it was not the LORD who did all this.''
5:32:28/For they are a nation lacking in counsel, and there is no understanding in them.
5:32:29/If only they were wise and would understand this, and discern what their end will be!
5:32:30/How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had surrendered them?
5:32:31/For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede.
5:32:32/Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison, their clusters are bitter;
5:32:33/Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.
5:32:34/Isn't this stored up with me, sealed in my treasuries?
5:32:35/Vengeance is mine, and recompense; their foot will slip in due time; for the day of their calamity is near, and the impending things are hastening upon them.
5:32:36/For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none remaining, bond or free.
5:32:37/And he will say, 'Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,
5:32:38/Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection.'
5:32:39/See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; and there is none that can deliver from my hand.
5:32:40/For I raise my hand to heaven and swear, As I live forever,
5:32:41/When I sharpen my flashing sword, and my hand grasps it in judgment; I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me.
5:32:42/I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword will devour flesh—the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired heads of the enemy.'
5:32:43/Rejoice, O nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will take vengeance on his adversaries, and will make atonement for his land and his people.
5:32:44/And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
5:32:45/And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
5:32:46/And he said to them, 'Take to heart all the words I am warning you today, that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.
5:32:47/For it is not an idle word for you; indeed, it is your life. And by this word, you will prolong your days in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.'
5:32:48/And the LORD spoke to Moses that very day, saying,
5:32:49/'Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel for a possession;
5:32:50/And die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
5:32:51/Because you broke faith with me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the children of Israel.
5:32:52/Yet you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.
5:33:1/This is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death.
5:33:2/He said, "The LORD came from Sinai and appeared to them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran and came with tens of thousands of holy ones. From His right hand came a fire of law for them.
5:33:3/Indeed, He loves His people; all His holy ones are in His hand. They followed at His feet and accepted His teachings.
5:33:4/Moses gave us a law, a precious inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
5:33:5/He became king in Jeshurun when the leaders of the people and the tribes of Israel came together.
5:33:6/May Reuben live and not die, and may his people be numerous."
5:33:7/For Judah, he said, "Listen, LORD, to the voice of Judah and bring him to his people. Strengthen his hands and help him against his adversaries."
5:33:8/About Levi, he said, "May your Thummim and Urim be with your faithful one, whom you tested at Massah and contended with at the waters of Meribah.
5:33:9/He who said to his father and mother, 'I do not recognize them,' and did not acknowledge his brothers or know his own children, for they kept Your word and maintained Your covenant.
5:33:10/They will teach Your regulations to Jacob and Your law to Israel. They will place incense before You and whole burnt offerings on Your altar.
5:33:11/Bless his wealth, LORD, and accept the work of his hands. Strike down those who rise against him and his foes so they rise no more."
5:33:12/For Benjamin, he said, "The LORD's beloved will dwell in safety by Him. He shields him all day long, and he rests between His shoulders."
5:33:13/For Joseph, he said, "May his land be blessed by the LORD with the precious gifts of heaven, with dew, and with the deep lying beneath,
5:33:14/With the best fruits brought forth by the sun, and the rich yield of the months,
5:33:15/With the finest produce of ancient mountains and the abundance of everlasting hills,
5:33:16/With the best gifts of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of Him who dwelled in the burning bush. Let these blessings rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince among his brothers.
5:33:17/His majesty is like a firstborn bull, and his horns are like the horns of a wild ox. With them, he will push the peoples to the ends of the earth. Such are the myriads of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh."
5:33:18/For Zebulun, he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents.
5:33:19/They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer sacrifices of righteousness; they will feast on the abundance of the seas and on treasures hidden in the sand."
5:33:20/For Gad, he said, "Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad's territory! Gad lives like a lion, tearing arm and head.
5:33:21/He chose the best land for himself; the leader's portion was reserved there. He came with the leaders of the people; he carried out the LORD's justice and His decrees for Israel."
5:33:22/For Dan, he said, "Dan is a lion's cub that leaps from Bashan."
5:33:23/For Naphtali, he said, "Naphtali is satisfied with favor and full of the LORD's blessing; take possession of the west and the south."
5:33:24/For Asher, he said, "May Asher be the most blessed of sons; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.
5:33:25/Your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will last as long as you live.
5:33:26/There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to help you and in His majesty soars through the skies.
5:33:27/The eternal God is your refuge, and beneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemies before you, saying, 'Destroy them!'
5:33:28/So Israel will live in safety; Jacob's spring is secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew.
5:33:29/Blessed are you, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will tread on their heights."
5:34:1/Moses climbed from the plains of Moab to the top of Mount Nebo, to the peak of Pisgah, across from Jericho. And the LORD showed him the entire land of Gilead, as far as Dan,
5:34:2/All of Naphtali, the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the whole region of Judah, reaching to the farthest sea,
5:34:3/The southern lands, and the valley plains of Jericho, the city of palm trees, extending to Zoar.
5:34:4/And the LORD told him, "This is the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it."
5:34:5/So Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said.
5:34:6/He was buried in a valley in Moab, across from Bethpeor, but to this day, no one knows where his grave is.
5:34:7/Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eyesight was still sharp, and he was as vigorous as ever.
5:34:8/The Israelites mourned for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
5:34:9/Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. The Israelites listened to him and followed the LORD's commands to Moses.
5:34:10/No prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
5:34:11/Who did all the miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to perform in Egypt—to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to his entire land.
5:34:12/And for all the mighty deeds and the great awe-inspiring acts that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
6:1:1/After Moses, the servant of the LORD, passed away, the LORD spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' assistant, saying,
6:1:2/"Moses my servant is no longer alive; now it's time for you to get up, cross the Jordan River, you and all the people, into the land I am giving them, the children of Israel.
6:1:3/Every place you set your foot, I have given to you, just as I promised Moses.
6:1:4/Your territory will extend from the desert and Lebanon to the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—and to the Great Sea on the west.
6:1:5/No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not leave you nor forsake you.
6:1:6/Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.
6:1:7/Only be strong and very courageous, making sure to follow all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may be successful wherever you go.
6:1:8/Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.
6:1:9/Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."
6:1:10/Then Joshua ordered the officers of the people,
6:1:11/"Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'"
6:1:12/To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
6:1:13/"Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: 'The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'
6:1:14/Your wives, your children, and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them,
6:1:15/until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."
6:1:16/They answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
6:1:17/Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.
6:1:18/Whoever rebels against your orders and does not obey your words, whatever you command, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."
6:2:1/Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two men from Shittim to secretly scout the land, especially Jericho. They went and stayed at the house of a prostitute named Rahab.
6:2:2/The king of Jericho was informed, "Look, men from the Israelites came here tonight to spy on the land."
6:2:3/So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, because they have come to spy on the entire land."
6:2:4/Rahab took the two men and hid them, then said, "Yes, men came to me, but I didn't know where they were from."
6:2:5/At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know where they went. Hurry, you might catch up with them."
6:2:6/But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had arranged there.
6:2:7/The king's men pursued them towards the Jordan River to the fords. As soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
6:2:8/Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up to them on the roof.
6:2:9/She said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you this land, and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this land are melting in fear because of you."
6:2:10/"We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you completely destroyed."
6:2:11/"When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below."
6:2:12/"Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign."
6:2:13/"That you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death."
6:2:14/The men assured her, "Our lives for yours! If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."
6:2:15/Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was part of the city wall, so she lived within the wall.
6:2:16/She told them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."
6:2:17/The men said to her, "We will be free from this oath you made us swear."
6:2:18/"When we enter the land, tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and bring your family into your house."
6:2:19/"If anyone goes outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own head, and we will be innocent. But if anyone within the house is harmed, their blood will be on our head."
6:2:20/"If you expose our mission, then we will be released from the oath you made us swear."
6:2:21/She agreed, "Let it be as you say." She sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
6:2:22/They left for the hills and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers searched all along the way but did not find them.
6:2:23/Then the two men came down from the hills, crossed the river, and reported to Joshua son of Nun all that had happened to them.
6:2:24/They told Joshua, "The LORD has indeed given the entire land into our hands; all the people are terrified of us."
6:3:1/Joshua got up early in the morning; they moved from Shittim to the Jordan River, he and all the Israelites, and stayed there before crossing.
6:3:2/After three days, the officers went through the camp;
6:3:3/They instructed the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, carried by the Levite priests, then you should leave your spot and follow it.
6:3:4/However, keep a distance of about two thousand cubits from it: do not come near it, so you can follow the path you need to take, since you have never traveled this way before.
6:3:5/Joshua told the people, "Prepare yourselves, because tomorrow the LORD will perform miracles among you."
6:3:6/Joshua said to the priests, "Carry the ark of the covenant and lead the way for the people." And they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.
6:3:7/The LORD told Joshua, "Today I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel, so they will know that, just as I was with Moses, I will be with you."
6:3:8/You must instruct the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters, stand still in the river.'"
6:3:9/Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God."
6:3:10/Joshua said, "This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.
6:3:11/See, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.
6:3:12/Now, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
6:3:13/As soon as the priests carrying the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, set foot in the Jordan's waters, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap."
6:3:14/When the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant ahead of them;
6:3:15/And as those carrying the ark reached the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (since the Jordan overflows all its banks during harvest time),
6:3:16/The waters flowing from upstream stopped and piled up far away at a town called Adam, near Zaretan, while the waters flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
6:3:17/The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all the Israelites crossed on dry ground, until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
6:4:1/When all the people had completely crossed the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
6:4:2/Select twelve men from the people, one from each tribe,
6:4:3/And instruct them to take twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the spot where the priests' feet stood firmly, and carry them over with you, leaving them at the place where you stay tonight.
6:4:4/Joshua then called the twelve men he had chosen from the Israelites, one from each tribe:
6:4:5/And Joshua told them, "Cross ahead of the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,
6:4:6/So that this may serve as a sign among you. When your children ask in the future, 'What do these stones mean to you?'
6:4:7/You shall tell them, 'The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.' And these stones shall serve as a memorial to the Israelites forever."
6:4:8/The Israelites did as Joshua commanded and took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, as the LORD had told Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and carried them over with them to their lodging place, where they set them down.
6:4:9/Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the spot where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.
6:4:10/The priests carrying the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell the people, following all that Moses had instructed Joshua. And the people hurried across.
6:4:11/When all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the LORD and the priests came across in full view of the people.
6:4:12/The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over ready for battle in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.
6:4:13/About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war.
6:4:14/On that day, the LORD elevated Joshua in the eyes of all Israel; and they respected him just as they had respected Moses all the days of his life.
6:4:15/And the LORD said to Joshua,
6:4:16/Order the priests carrying the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan.
6:4:17/So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."
6:4:18/And as soon as the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet touched dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before.
6:4:19/The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped in Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
6:4:20/And Joshua set up in Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.
6:4:21/He said to the Israelites, "When your children ask their parents in the future, 'What do these stones mean?'
6:4:22/You shall tell your children, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'
6:4:23/For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,
6:4:24/So that all the peoples of the earth may know the power of the LORD, that it is mighty: that you may always fear the LORD your God."
6:5:1/When all the kings of the Amorites to the west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites by the sea heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the Israelites to cross, their courage failed, and they no longer had the will to fight because of the Israelites.
6:5:2/At that time, the LORD instructed Joshua, "Make sharp knives and circumcise the Israelites again."
6:5:3/Joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the Israelites at the hill of the foreskins.
6:5:4/The reason Joshua circumcised them was that all the male warriors who had left Egypt had died in the wilderness on the way, after leaving Egypt.
6:5:5/All the people who had left Egypt were circumcised, but those born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not been circumcised.
6:5:6/The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years until all the warriors who had left Egypt had perished, because they did not obey the LORD. The LORD had sworn not to show them the land flowing with milk and honey that he had promised their ancestors.
6:5:7/Joshua circumcised their children, who had taken their place, because they had not been circumcised during the journey.
6:5:8/After circumcising all the people, they stayed in their places in the camp until they had healed.
6:5:9/The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have removed the disgrace of Egypt from you." Therefore, the place has been called Gilgal to this day.
6:5:10/The Israelites camped at Gilgal and celebrated Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
6:5:11/The day after Passover, they ate from the produce of the land; unleavened bread and roasted grain.
6:5:12/After they ate the produce of the land, the manna stopped. From that year on, the Israelites ate from the crops of Canaan.
6:5:13/While Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword. Joshua approached him and asked, "Are you with us or with our enemies?"
6:5:14/The man replied, "No, I am the commander of the LORD's army." Joshua fell facedown in reverence and asked, "What message does my Lord have for his servant?"
6:5:15/The commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
6:6:1/Jericho was tightly sealed off because of the Israelites: no one could enter or leave.
6:6:2/And the LORD said to Joshua, "Look, I have handed over to you Jericho, its king, and its valiant warriors."
6:6:3/"You and all your warriors shall march around the city once a day for six days."
6:6:4/"Seven priests will carry seven ram's horn trumpets in front of the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow the trumpets."
6:6:5/"When they sound a long blast on the ram's horn and you hear the trumpet's sound, all the people shall shout loudly; the city's wall will collapse, and the people will storm the city, each going straight ahead."
6:6:6/Joshua, son of Nun, summoned the priests and said to them, "Carry the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven ram's horn trumpets in front of the LORD's ark."
6:6:7/He told the people, "Move forward and march around the city, with the armed men leading the way in front of the LORD's ark."
6:6:8/When Joshua had given the instructions, the seven priests carrying the seven ram's horn trumpets advanced before the LORD, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them.
6:6:9/The armed men marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark, with the priests continually blowing the trumpets.
6:6:10/Joshua commanded the people, "Do not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor utter a word, until the day I tell you to shout; then you shall shout."
6:6:11/So the ark of the LORD circled the city, completing one circuit; then they returned to camp and stayed there.
6:6:12/Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests carried the ark of the LORD.
6:6:13/Seven priests carrying seven ram's horn trumpets before the ark of the LORD walked on, continually blowing the trumpets; the armed men went ahead of them, and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, with the priests continually blowing the trumpets.
6:6:14/On the second day, they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
6:6:15/On the seventh day, they got up at dawn and circled the city in the same manner seven times; that day they circled the city seven times.
6:6:16/At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for the LORD has given you the city."
6:6:17/The city and everything in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent."
6:6:18/"But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise, you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it."
6:6:19/"All the silver, gold, bronze, and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury."
6:6:20/So when the priests blew the trumpets, the people shouted loudly, and the wall collapsed; then the people charged straight into the city and captured it.
6:6:21/They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys.
6:6:22/Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out, along with all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her."
6:6:23/The spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel.
6:6:24/They burned the city and everything in it, but they put the silver, gold, bronze, and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house.
6:6:25/Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her family, and all who belonged to her. She lives in Israel to this day because she hid the messengers Joshua sent to spy on Jericho.
6:6:26/Joshua pronounced a curse at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho. At the cost of his firstborn son, he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest, he will set up its gates."
6:6:27/So the LORD was with Joshua, and his reputation spread throughout the land.
6:7:1/But the Israelites violated the ban by taking some of the devoted things. Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of these things, and the LORD's anger burned against the Israelites.
6:7:2/Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Bethaven, east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and scout the area." So the men went up and scouted Ai.
6:7:3/They returned to Joshua and said, "Not all the people need to go up; send two or three thousand men to take Ai. Don't weary everyone, for they are few."
6:7:4/So about three thousand men went up, but they were routed by the men of Ai.
6:7:5/The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the city gate to Shebarim and striking them down on the slopes. At this, the hearts of the people melted in fear.
6:7:6/Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the LORD until evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads.
6:7:7/And Joshua said, "Oh Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
6:7:8/O LORD, what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?
6:7:9/The Canaanites and all the other inhabitants of the land will hear about this and will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your great name?"
6:7:10/The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! Why are you lying down on your face?
6:7:11/Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, and they have put them with their own possessions.
6:7:12/That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
6:7:13/Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.
6:7:14/In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the LORD takes shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the LORD takes shall come forward family by family; and the family the LORD takes shall come forward man by man.
6:7:15/Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the LORD and has done an outrageous thing in Israel.'"
6:7:16/Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was taken.
6:7:17/The clans of Judah came forward, and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zabdi was taken.
6:7:18/Then he had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
6:7:19/Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me."
6:7:20/And Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I did:
6:7:21/When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
6:7:22/So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
6:7:23/They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD.
6:7:24/Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.
6:7:25/Joshua said, "Why have you brought trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.
6:7:26/Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.
6:8:1/The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take all your warriors with you and go up to Ai. See, I have given you the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
6:8:2/You shall treat Ai and its king as you did Jericho and its king. However, you may take their possessions and livestock for yourselves. Set up an ambush behind the city."
6:8:3/So Joshua got up, along with all the warriors, to attack Ai. Joshua selected thirty thousand strong and courageous men and sent them out at night.
6:8:4/He instructed them, "Watch the city from behind, but don't go too far. Stay alert and ready."
6:8:5/"I and all the people with me will approach the city. When they come out to fight us as before, we'll run away from them,
6:8:6/They will chase us until we've lured them away from the city, thinking, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So we will run from them.
6:8:7/Then you will come out of your ambush and capture the city, for the LORD your God will give it into your hands.
6:8:8/Once you've taken the city, set it on fire. Follow the LORD's command exactly. I have instructed you."
6:8:9/Joshua sent them off, and they went to the ambush site and stayed between Bethel and Ai, west of Ai. Joshua spent that night with the people.
6:8:10/Joshua got up early in the morning, mustered the people, and led them, along with the elders of Israel, to Ai.
6:8:11/All the warriors with him advanced and approached the city, setting up camp north of Ai, with a valley between them and the city.
6:8:12/He took about five thousand men and positioned them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
6:8:13/After positioning the troops, with the main camp north of the city and the ambush to the west, Joshua went into the valley that night.
6:8:14/When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he and his men hurried out early in the morning to attack Israel in a prearranged battle location, not knowing there was an ambush behind the city.
6:8:15/Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated and fled toward the wilderness.
6:8:16/All the men of Ai were called to chase after them, drawing them away from the city.
6:8:17/Not a single man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not chase after Israel, leaving the city unprotected.
6:8:18/The LORD said to Joshua, "Point the spear in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." Joshua pointed the spear toward the city.
6:8:19/The ambush quickly emerged from their position, ran into the city as soon as Joshua extended his hand, captured it, and immediately set it on fire.
6:8:20/When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke of their city rising to the sky, leaving them no chance to escape in any direction. The Israelites who had fled to the wilderness turned back against their pursuers.
6:8:21/Seeing that the ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, Joshua and all Israel turned back and attacked the men of Ai.
6:8:22/The others came out of the city to confront them, so the Ai men were surrounded by Israelites, some on one side and some on the other. They were defeated, leaving none alive or able to escape.
6:8:23/They captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
6:8:24/After killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open fields and wilderness where they had chased them, and after all of them had fallen by the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it down with the sword.
6:8:25/That day, twelve thousand men and women, the entire population of Ai, were killed.
6:8:26/Joshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had stretched out with the spear, until he had completely destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
6:8:27/Only the livestock and the spoils of the city did the Israelites take for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua.
6:8:28/Joshua burned Ai, turning it into a permanent heap of ruins, desolate to this day.
6:8:29/He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered the body to be taken down from the tree, thrown at the entrance of the city gate, and a large pile of stones was erected over it, which remains to this day.
6:8:30/Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel on Mount Ebal,
6:8:31/As Moses, the servant of the LORD, had commanded the Israelites. He built it of uncut stones on which no iron tool had been used. On it, they offered burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings.
6:8:32/There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses.
6:8:33/All Israel, including their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark, facing the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses, the servant of the LORD, had previously instructed to bless the people of Israel.
6:8:34/Afterward, he read all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the book of the law.
6:8:35/There wasn't a single word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read aloud to the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, children, and the foreigners living among them.
6:9:1/When all the kings west of the Jordan River—the ones in the hills, valleys, and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea near Lebanon (the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—heard about this,
6:9:2/They joined forces to fight against Joshua and Israel, united in their effort.
6:9:3/When the people of Gibeon heard about what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
6:9:4/They resorted to a trick; they acted as if they were ambassadors, carrying worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and old, patched wine skins,
6:9:5/Wearing old, patched shoes and ragged clothes; all their bread was dry and moldy.
6:9:6/They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, "We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty with us."
6:9:7/But the Israelites said to the Hivites, "Maybe you live near us. How can we make a treaty with you?"
6:9:8/They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Joshua asked, "Who are you and where do you come from?"
6:9:9/They answered, "Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. We have heard reports of him, all that he did in Egypt,
6:9:10/And everything he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
6:9:11/So our elders and all the residents of our country told us, 'Take provisions for the journey and go to meet them. Say to them, "We are your servants; please make a treaty with us."'"
6:9:12/"This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now, see, it is dry and moldy.
6:9:13/And these wine skins that we filled were new, but see, they are torn; and our clothes and shoes are worn out from the very long journey."
6:9:14/The men sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD.
6:9:15/Joshua made peace with them and made a treaty with them to let them live, and the leaders of the community swore an oath to them.
6:9:16/Three days after they made the treaty with them, they learned that they were neighbors, living among them.
6:9:17/The Israelites set out and reached their cities on the third day. Their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
6:9:18/But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. The whole community grumbled against the leaders.
6:9:19/But all the leaders answered the whole community, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
6:9:20/This is what we will do to them: we will let them live, so that God's wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them."
6:9:21/They said, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community." So the leaders' promise to them was kept.
6:9:22/Joshua called for them and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, 'We live far away from you,' when actually you live among us?
6:9:23/Now you are cursed, and you will never be freed from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."
6:9:24/They answered Joshua, "Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.
6:9:25/Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you."
6:9:26/He did this for them; he saved them from the hands of the Israelites and they did not kill them.
6:9:27/That day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the LORD, at the place the LORD would choose, which they are to this day.
6:10:1/When Adonizedec, the king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and completely destroyed it, just as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were now among them;
6:10:2/They were very afraid because Gibeon was a significant city, like one of the royal cities, and it was larger than Ai, with all its men being warriors.
6:10:3/So, Adonizedec, the king of Jerusalem, sent messages to Hoham, king of Hebron, Piram, king of Jarmuth, Japhia, king of Lachish, and Debir, king of Eglon, saying,
6:10:4/"Come up to me and help me attack Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."
6:10:5/Therefore, the five Amorite kings - the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon - joined forces, moved out with all their troops, and laid siege to Gibeon, waging war against it.
6:10:6/The people of Gibeon quickly sent a message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal: "Don't abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."
6:10:7/So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with all his soldiers, including the most valiant warriors.
6:10:8/And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hands. Not one of them will be able to withstand you."
6:10:9/Joshua therefore attacked them by surprise, marching all night from Gilgal.
6:10:10/And the LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, leading to a great slaughter at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Bethhoron and struck them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
6:10:11/As they fled before Israel on the road down from Bethhoron to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hail than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.
6:10:12/Then Joshua spoke to the LORD on the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel and said in the presence of Israel: "Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, Moon, over the Valley of Aijalon."
6:10:13/And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation avenged itself on its enemies. Isn't this recorded in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.
6:10:14/There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a human being. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel.
6:10:15/Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
6:10:16/But the five kings fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah.
6:10:17/When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave at Makkedah,
6:10:18/he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and station men there to guard them.
6:10:19/But don't stop; pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."
6:10:20/When Joshua and the Israelites had finished striking them down with a great slaughter until they were wiped out, and the survivors had entered their fortified cities,
6:10:21/all the troops returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. No one dared to utter a word against the Israelites.
6:10:22/Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me."
6:10:23/They did so and brought the five kings out of the cave to him—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
6:10:24/When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the soldiers who had gone with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." They came forward and placed their feet on their necks.
6:10:25/Joshua then said to them, "Do not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."
6:10:26/Afterward, Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung their bodies on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.
6:10:27/At sunset, Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees, threw them into the cave where they had been hiding, and placed large rocks at the cave's entrance, which are there to this day.
6:10:28/That day Joshua captured Makkedah, struck it and its king with the sword, and completely destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
6:10:29/Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.
6:10:30/And the LORD also gave it and its king into Israel's hand. Joshua struck it and everyone in it with the sword, leaving no survivors. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
6:10:31/From Libnah, Joshua and all Israel with him moved on to Lachish; they camped against it and attacked it.
6:10:32/The LORD gave Lachish into Israel's hands, and they captured it on the second day, striking it and everyone in it with the sword, just as they had done to Libnah.
6:10:33/Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his people, leaving no survivors.
6:10:34/From Lachish, Joshua moved on to Eglon with all Israel. They camped against it and attacked it.
6:10:35/They captured it that same day and struck it with the sword. He completely destroyed everyone in it that day, just as he had done to Lachish.
6:10:36/Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.
6:10:37/They captured it and struck it with the sword, along with its king, all its towns, and everyone in it. He left no survivors, just as he had done to Eglon, completely destroying it and everyone in it.
6:10:38/Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned to Debir and attacked it.
6:10:39/He captured it, its king, and all its towns. They struck them with the sword and completely destroyed everyone in them. He left no survivors. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king.
6:10:40/So Joshua struck the whole region of the hills, the Negev, the western foothills, and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors but completely destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
6:10:41/Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and all the country of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
6:10:42/Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
6:10:43/Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
6:11:1/When Jabin, the king of Hazor, heard about these events, he sent messages to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph,
6:11:2/As well as to the kings north of the mountains, those in the plains south of Chinneroth, in the valley, and in the territories of Dor to the west,
6:11:3/He also reached out to the Canaanites in the east and west, and to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites in the mountains, and the Hivites below Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
6:11:4/They mobilized, bringing a massive force with them, as numerous as the sand on the seashore, equipped with many horses and chariots.
6:11:5/When all these kings joined forces, they gathered and camped together at the waters of Merom to wage war against Israel.
6:11:6/The LORD told Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them. By this time tomorrow, I will hand them all over to Israel, defeated. You are to cripple their horses and burn their chariots."
6:11:7/So Joshua and his warriors took them by surprise near the waters of Merom and attacked them suddenly.
6:11:8/The LORD gave them into Israel's hands. They defeated them and pursued them to Great Sidon, Misrephoth Maim, and the valley of Mizpeh to the east, leaving no survivors.
6:11:9/Joshua did as the LORD instructed: he crippled their horses and burned their chariots.
6:11:10/Then Joshua turned back, captured Hazor, and killed its king with the sword. Hazor had previously been the leader of all those kingdoms.
6:11:11/They killed everyone in it with the sword, completely destroying them. No one was left alive, and he burned Hazor itself.
6:11:12/Joshua captured all the cities of those kings and killed their kings with the sword, utterly destroying them, just as Moses, the servant of the LORD, had commanded.
6:11:13/However, Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
6:11:14/The Israelites took all the spoils and livestock of these cities for themselves, but they killed all the people with the sword until they had destroyed them, without sparing anyone.
6:11:15/Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
6:11:16/Thus, Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the lowlands, the Arabah, the mountains of Israel and their lowlands,
6:11:17/From Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, struck them down, and killed them.
6:11:18/Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.
6:11:19/No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle.
6:11:20/For it was the LORD's will to harden their hearts so they would wage war against Israel, enabling him to completely destroy them without mercy, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
6:11:21/At that time, Joshua eliminated the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the mountains of Judah and Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them and their cities.
6:11:22/No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did some remain.
6:11:23/So Joshua took the entire land, just as the LORD had told Moses; and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. And the land had rest from war.
6:12:1/Here are the kings of the land that the Israelites defeated and whose territories they took over east of the Jordan, from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, and all the eastern plains:
6:12:2/Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon River, through the middle of the river valley, and as far as the Jabbok River, the boundary of the Ammonites;
6:12:3/And from the plains to the Sea of Galilee in the east, and to the Dead Sea in the east, by the route to Beth Jeshimoth, and from the south below the slopes of Pisgah;
6:12:4/And the territory of Og, king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei,
6:12:5/And ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, and all Bashan to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
6:12:6/Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites defeated them. And Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6:12:7/Here are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baalgad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their lands as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their tribal divisions,
6:12:8/Including the hill country, the western foothills, the Arabah, the slopes, the desert, and the Negev - the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites:
6:12:9/The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, near Bethel, one;
6:12:10/The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
6:12:11/The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
6:12:12/The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
6:12:13/The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
6:12:14/The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
6:12:15/The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
6:12:16/The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
6:12:17/The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
6:12:18/The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
6:12:19/The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
6:12:20/The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
6:12:21/The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
6:12:22/The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
6:12:23/The king of Dor in the region of Dor, one; the king of the nations at Gilgal, one;
6:12:24/The king of Tirzah, one: totaling thirty-one kings.
6:13:1/Now Joshua was old and advanced in years; and the LORD said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there is still a great deal of land to be taken.
6:13:2/This is the land that remains: all the territories of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
6:13:3/From Sihor, which is before Egypt, to the borders of Ekron to the north, considered part of Canaanite territory: the five rulers of the Philistines; the people of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron; as well as the Avites:
6:13:4/To the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is next to the Sidonians up to Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
6:13:5/And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, towards the east, from Baalgad below Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
6:13:6/All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, I will drive out before the children of Israel: just divide it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have instructed you.
6:13:7/Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
6:13:8/Together with the Reubenites and the Gadites who have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, east of the Jordan, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
6:13:9/From Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city in the middle of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
6:13:10/And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
6:13:11/And Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salcah;
6:13:12/All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who was left of the remnant of the giants: for Moses defeated them and drove them out.
6:13:13/However, the children of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites live among the Israelites to this day.
6:13:14/Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings made by fire to the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance, as he told them.
6:13:15/And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben their inheritance according to their families.
6:13:16/And their territory was from Aroer, on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city in the middle of the river, and all the plain near Medeba;
6:13:17/Heshbon, and all its cities in the plain; Dibon, Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,
6:13:18/And Jahaza, Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
6:13:19/And Kirjathaim, Sibmah, and Zarethshahar on the mount of the valley,
6:13:20/And Bethpeor, Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,
6:13:21/And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated along with the princes of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were leaders of Sihon, living in the land.
6:13:22/Balaam also the son of Beor, the diviner, was killed by the children of Israel with the sword among those who were slain by them.
6:13:23/And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and its boundary. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.
6:13:24/And Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad according to their families.
6:13:25/And their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, up to Aroer that is before Rabbah;
6:13:26/And from Heshbon to Ramathmizpeh and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
6:13:27/And in the valley, Betharam, Bethnimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the remainder of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as its boundary, up to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward.
6:13:28/This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities, and their villages.
6:13:29/And Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
6:13:30/And their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities:
6:13:31/And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were assigned to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to one half of the children of Machir by their families.
6:13:32/These are the territories which Moses distributed as inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
6:13:33/But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance, as he told them.
6:14:1/Here are the lands that the Israelites received as their inheritance in Canaan, distributed by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the Israelite tribes.
6:14:2/Their inheritance was determined by drawing lots, as the LORD had instructed through Moses, for the nine and a half tribes.
6:14:3/Moses had already granted land to two and a half tribes east of the Jordan River. However, the Levites were not given any land among them.
6:14:4/Since the descendants of Joseph formed two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, the Levites were not given a share of the land but were given cities to live in, along with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock and possessions.
6:14:5/Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, the Israelites followed through and divided the land accordingly.
6:14:6/The tribe of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD told Moses about you and me in Kadesh Barnea.
6:14:7/I was forty years old when Moses, the LORD's servant, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to scout out the land, and I reported back to him with my honest opinion.
6:14:8/However, my fellow scouts discouraged the people, but I remained completely loyal to the LORD my God.
6:14:9/And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and your children's forever, because you have been completely loyal to the LORD my God.'
6:14:10/And now, look, the LORD has kept me alive, as he promised, for forty-five years since he said this to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness. And here I am today, eighty-five years old.
6:14:11/I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as capable now of going to battle as I was then.
6:14:12/So now, give me this hill country that the LORD promised me that day. You yourself heard back then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified. But with the LORD helping me, I will drive them out just as he said."
6:14:13/Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
6:14:14/Therefore, Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he was completely loyal to the LORD, the God of Israel.
6:14:15/Before, Hebron was called Kiriath Arba, named after Arba, a great hero among the Anakites. And the land had peace from war.
6:15:1/This then was the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah and their clans; the southernmost part of their territory was the wilderness of Zin, extending southward to the border of Edom.
6:15:2/Their southern border started from the edge of the Dead Sea, from the bay that faces southward:
6:15:3/It extended to the southern slope of Maalehacrabbim, continued to Zin, ascended on the south side to Kadeshbarnea, moved toward Hezron, went up to Adar, and curved toward Karkaa:
6:15:4/From there it passed toward Azmon, extended to the Brook of Egypt, and its terminations were at the sea: this will be your southern border.
6:15:5/And the eastern border was the Dead Sea, up to the mouth of the Jordan River. And the northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan:
6:15:6/And the border went up to Bethhogla, moved north of Betharabah; and the boundary ascended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
6:15:7/Then the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor, turning northward toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, south of the river. The border continued toward the waters of Enshemesh and ended at Enrogel:
6:15:8/And the border ascended through the Valley of Ben Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusite territory, which is Jerusalem. Then the border climbed to the top of the mountain opposite the Valley of Hinnom to the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim:
6:15:9/From the mountain's summit, the border extended to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, moved out to the towns of Mount Ephron, and then the border bent toward Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:
6:15:10/And the border circled westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), descended to Bethshemesh, and passed Timnah:
6:15:11/The border then extended to the north side of Ekron, curved to Shicron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and reached Jabneel. The terminations of the border were at the sea.
6:15:12/And the western border was the Mediterranean Sea and its coastline. This is the surrounding boundary of the children of Judah according to their clans.
6:15:13/To Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he gave a portion among the children of Judah, as the LORD commanded Joshua, which was the city of Arba, the father of Anak, that is, Hebron.
6:15:14/And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.
6:15:15/Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir; previously, Debir was called Kirjathsepher.
6:15:16/And Caleb said, "Whoever attacks Kirjathsepher and captures it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife."
6:15:17/And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.
6:15:18/When she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"
6:15:19/She replied, "Please give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
6:15:20/This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their clans.
6:15:21/The farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah near the border of Edom in the south were Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur,
6:15:22/And Kinah, Dimonah, and Adadah,
6:15:23/And Kedesh, Hazor, and Ithnan,
6:15:24/Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth,
6:15:25/And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, Hezron (that is, Hazor),
6:15:26/Amam, Shema, and Moladah,
6:15:27/And Hazargaddah, Heshmon, and Bethpalet,
6:15:28/And Hazarshual, Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,
6:15:29/Baalah, Iim, and Azem,
6:15:30/And Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah,
6:15:31/And Ziklag, Madmannah, and Sansannah,
6:15:32/And Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty-nine, with their villages.
6:15:33/In the valley, Eshtaol, Zoreah, Ashnah,
6:15:34/And Zanoah, Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
6:15:35/Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
6:15:36/And Sharaim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
6:15:37/Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdalgad,
6:15:38/And Dilean, Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
6:15:39/Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon,
6:15:40/And Cabbon, Lahmam, and Kithlish,
6:15:41/And Gederoth, Bethdagon, Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
6:15:42/Libnah, Ether, and Ashan,
6:15:43/And Jiphtah, Ashnah, and Nezib,
6:15:44/And Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
6:15:45/Ekron, with its surrounding towns and villages.
6:15:46/From Ekron to the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages.
6:15:47/Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages, up to the Brook of Egypt and the Great Sea and its coastline.
6:15:48/And in the mountains, Shamir, Jattir, and Socoh,
6:15:49/And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,
6:15:50/And Anab, Eshtemoh, and Anim,
6:15:51/And Goshen, Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
6:15:52/Arab, Dumah, and Eshean,
6:15:53/And Janum, Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,
6:15:54/And Humtah, and Kirjatharba (which is Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
6:15:55/Maon, Carmel, Ziph, and Juttah,
6:15:56/And Jezreel, Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
6:15:57/Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
6:15:58/Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,
6:15:59/And Maarath, Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
6:15:60/Kirjathbaal (which is Kirjathjearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
6:15:61/In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,
6:15:62/And Nibshan, the City of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.
6:15:63/As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites live among the children of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.
6:16:1/The territory allocated to Joseph's descendants extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, eastward to the waters of Jericho, through the wilderness, and up to Mount Bethel.
6:16:2/It then proceeded from Bethel to Luz, and continued to the borders of Archi at Ataroth,
6:16:3/Descending westward to the territory of Japhleti, reaching the area of lower Bethhoron, and extending to Gezer; its boundaries ended at the sea.
6:16:4/Thus, the descendants of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
6:16:5/The boundary for the Ephraimite clans was as follows: starting from Atarothaddar in the east, it stretched to upper Bethhoron;
6:16:6/Then the boundary extended northward to the sea, reaching Michmethah on the north; it curved eastward to Taanathshiloh, passing it on the east side towards Janohah;
6:16:7/From Janohah, it descended to Ataroth and Naarath, reached Jericho, and ended at the Jordan River.
6:16:8/The boundary extended from Tappuah westward to the Kanah River; its end was at the sea. This defined the inheritance for the Ephraimite clans.
6:16:9/Additionally, Ephraim's descendants had separate cities within the territories of Manasseh, including all the cities with their villages.
6:16:10/However, they did not expel the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day, the Canaanites live among the Ephraimites but are subjected to forced labor.
6:17:1/The tribe of Manasseh also received a portion because Manasseh was Joseph's firstborn. Specifically, Machir, Manasseh's firstborn and the father of Gilead, a warrior, received Gilead and Bashan.
6:17:2/Additionally, portions were allocated to the other descendants of Manasseh according to their families, including the descendants of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, Joseph's son, by their families.
6:17:3/However, Zelophehad, a descendant of Hepher, Gilead, Machir, and Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
6:17:4/They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, stating, "The LORD instructed Moses to grant us an inheritance among our brothers." So, following the LORD's command, they received an inheritance among their father's brothers.
6:17:5/Manasseh received ten portions in addition to Gilead and Bashan, which were located on the other side of the Jordan River.
6:17:6/This was because Manasseh's daughters received an inheritance among his sons, and the remaining sons of Manasseh received the land of Gilead.
6:17:7/The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Michmethah, near Shechem. The boundary then followed a path to the right towards the residents of Entappuah.
6:17:8/Manasseh owned the land of Tappuah, but the town of Tappuah on Manasseh's border belonged to the Ephraimites.
6:17:9/The boundary went down to the Kanah River, south of the river. These cities of Ephraim were situated among the cities of Manasseh. The boundary of Manasseh was on the north side of the river, ending at the sea.
6:17:10/The land to the south belonged to Ephraim, while the land to the north belonged to Manasseh, with the sea marking its boundary. They bordered Asher to the north and Issachar to the east.
6:17:11/Manasseh had territories within Issachar and Asher, including Bethshean and its surrounding towns, Ibleam and its towns, as well as the towns of Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, encompassing three regions.
6:17:12/However, the descendants of Manasseh were unable to drive out the inhabitants of these cities, and the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
6:17:13/Eventually, as the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not completely expel them.
6:17:14/The descendants of Joseph complained to Joshua, "Why have you given us only one portion and one lot as our inheritance? We are a numerous people because the LORD has blessed us abundantly."
6:17:15/Joshua responded, "If you are so numerous, go up to the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the territory of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, if the hill country of Ephraim is too confined for you."
6:17:16/But the descendants of Joseph argued, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites living in the plains have iron chariots, both those in Bethshean and its towns and those in the Valley of Jezreel."
6:17:17/Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to both Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are a numerous people with great strength. You will not have just one allotment.
6:17:18/But the forested hill country will be yours. You can clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. You will drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and are strong."
6:18:1/And the entire community of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the meeting tent there. The land was conquered before them.
6:18:2/And among the Israelites, there were seven tribes that had not yet received their inheritance.
6:18:3/And Joshua asked the Israelites, "How long will you delay in taking possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you?"
6:18:4/Select three men from each tribe, and I will send them out. They will survey the land according to its inheritance and then return to me.
6:18:5/They will divide it into seven parts: Judah will stay in their territory to the south, and the descendants of Joseph will stay in their territories to the north.
6:18:6/Therefore, survey the land in seven parts and bring the survey back to me, so I can draw lots for you here before the LORD our God.
6:18:7/But the Levites will not have a share among you because the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance east of the Jordan, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave them.
6:18:8/And the men set out and Joshua instructed those who were to survey the land, "Go, walk through the land, survey it, and return to me. Then I will draw lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh."
6:18:9/And the men went and passed through the land, surveying it by cities into seven parts in a record, and returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
6:18:10/And Joshua drew lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. There, Joshua allocated the land to the Israelites according to their divisions.
6:18:11/The lot for the tribe of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the descendants of Judah and Joseph.
6:18:12/And their northern border started from the Jordan, went up to the north side of Jericho, up through the mountains westward, and ended at the desert of Bethaven.
6:18:13/From there, the border extended toward Luz, to the southern side of Luz (which is Bethel), and then went down to Atarothadar, near the hill south of lower Beth Horon.
6:18:14/Then the border turned and wrapped around the southern corner, from the hill facing Beth Horon southward; and its end points were at Kirjath Baal (which is Kirjath Jearim), a city of the descendants of Judah. This was the western side.
6:18:15/And the southern side began from the edge of Kirjath Jearim, and the border extended westward and went to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
6:18:16/Then the border came down to the edge of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, which is in the Valley of the Giants to the north, descended to the Hinnom Valley, along the south side of the Jebusites, and went down to Enrogel.
6:18:17/It was drawn from the north and extended to Enshemesh, then went toward Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and went down to the Stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.
6:18:18/It passed along toward the northern side opposite the Arabah and went down into the Arabah.
6:18:19/The border passed along the northern side of Beth Hoglah, and the boundary ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern boundary.
6:18:20/And the Jordan formed its border on the eastern side. This was the inheritance of the descendants of Benjamin, by its boundaries all around, according to their families.
6:18:21/Now the cities of the tribe of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, and the Valley of Keziz,
6:18:22/And Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, and Bethel,
6:18:23/And Avvim, Parah, and Ophrah,
6:18:24/And Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages,
6:18:25/Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth,
6:18:26/And Mizpah, Chephirah, and Mozah,
6:18:27/And Rekem, Irpeel, and Taralah,
6:18:28/And Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite city (which is Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the descendants of Benjamin according to their families.
6:19:1/And the second lot was drawn for Simeon, for the tribe of Simeon's descendants according to their families: their inheritance was within the territory of Judah's descendants.
6:19:2/Their territory included Beersheba, Sheba, and Moladah,
6:19:3/As well as Hazarshual, Balah, and Azem,
6:19:4/And Eltolad, Bethul, and Hormah,
6:19:5/Also Ziklag, Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,
6:19:6/And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities along with their surrounding villages:
6:19:7/Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:
6:19:8/And all the villages around these cities up to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the Simeonite tribe according to their families.
6:19:9/The Simeonites received their inheritance from the portion of Judah's descendants because Judah's portion was too large for them; thus, the Simeonites' inheritance was within Judah's territory.
6:19:10/And the third lot came up for the Zebulunites according to their families: the boundary of their inheritance reached Sarid:
6:19:11/Their boundary extended toward the sea, included Maralah, reached Dabbasheth, and went up to the river near Jokneam;
6:19:12/It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the boundary of Chislothtabor, then went to Daberath, and up to Japhia,
6:19:13/From there it continued east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and went out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;
6:19:14/The boundary circled north to Hannathon, ending in the valley of Jiphthahel:
6:19:15/Including Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
6:19:16/This is the inheritance of the Zebulunites according to their families, these cities with their villages.
6:19:17/And the fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the Issacharites according to their families.
6:19:18/Their boundary included Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem,
6:19:19/And Haphraim, Shihon, and Anaharath,
6:19:20/And Rabbith, Kishion, and Abez,
6:19:21/And Remeth, Engannim, Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;
6:19:22/The boundary reached Tabor, Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; the end of their boundary was at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
6:19:23/This is the inheritance of the Issacharite tribe according to their families, the cities and their villages.
6:19:24/And the fifth lot came out for the Asherites according to their families.
6:19:25/Their boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, and Achshaph,
6:19:26/And Alammelech, Amad, and Misheal; it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;
6:19:27/It turned toward the sunrise to Bethdagon, reached Zebulun, and the valley of Jiphthahel north of Bethemek and Neiel, and extended to Cabul on the left,
6:19:28/And Hebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as great Zidon;
6:19:29/Then the boundary turned to Ramah, reaching the fortified city of Tyre; the boundary turned to Hosah, ending at the sea by the region of Achzib:
6:19:30/Including Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.
6:19:31/This is the inheritance of the Asherite tribe according to their families, these cities with their villages.
6:19:32/The sixth lot came out for the Naphtalites, for the Naphtalites according to their families.
6:19:33/Their boundary started from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, included Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, up to Lakum; and it ended at the Jordan:
6:19:34/Then the boundary turned westward to Aznothtabor, and from there it went to Hukkok, touching Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise.
6:19:35/The fortified cities included Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
6:19:36/And Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor,
6:19:37/And Kedesh, Edrei, and Enhazor,
6:19:38/And Iron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
6:19:39/This is the inheritance of the Naphtalite tribe according to their families, the cities and their villages.
6:19:40/And the seventh lot came out for the Danites according to their families.
6:19:41/The boundary of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,
6:19:42/And Shaalabbin, Ajalon, and Jethlah,
6:19:43/And Elon, Thimnathah, and Ekron,
6:19:44/And Eltekeh, Gibbethon, and Baalath,
6:19:45/And Jehud, Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,
6:19:46/And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the territory facing Japho.
6:19:47/The territory of the Danites was too small for them, so they went up, fought against Leshem, captured it, struck it with the sword, took possession of it, settled there, and renamed Leshem as Dan, after their ancestor Dan.
6:19:48/This is the inheritance of the Danite tribe according to their families, these cities with their villages.
6:19:49/After they finished dividing the land into inheritances by their boundaries, the Israelites gave an inheritance among them to Joshua son of Nun:
6:19:50/By the LORD's command, they gave him the city he requested, Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the city and settled there.
6:19:51/These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes distributed as inheritances by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Thus, they finished dividing the land.
6:20:1/The LORD also spoke to Joshua, saying,
6:20:2/Tell the children of Israel to set aside cities of refuge, as I instructed through Moses.
6:20:3/These cities will be a safe haven for anyone who accidentally kills another person, protecting them from the avenger of blood.
6:20:4/When someone seeking refuge reaches one of these cities, they must explain their situation to the city elders at the gate. The elders will then allow them to enter and live among them.
6:20:5/If the avenger of blood comes after them, the city must not hand over the person, because the killing was accidental and there was no prior hatred.
6:20:6/They can live in that city until they are tried by the congregation and until the high priest of that time dies. After that, they can return to their own city and home, from which they fled.
6:20:7/They designated Kedesh in Galilee in the hills of Naphtali, Shechem in the hills of Ephraim, and Kirjatharba (Hebron) in the hills of Judah.
6:20:8/Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
6:20:9/These cities were set aside for all the children of Israel and for any foreigner living among them, so that anyone who accidentally killed someone could flee there and not be killed by the avenger of blood until they had a trial before the congregation.
6:21:1/Then the leaders of the Levite families approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the other Israelite tribes;
6:21:2/They spoke to them at Shiloh in Canaan, saying, "The LORD, through Moses, commanded us to be given cities to live in, along with their surrounding pasturelands for our livestock."
6:21:3/So, following the LORD's command, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands from their own inheritance.
6:21:4/The Kohathite families received their cities by lot. The descendants of Aaron the priest, who were Levites, received thirteen cities from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
6:21:5/The other Kohathite families received ten cities by lot from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6:21:6/The Gershonite families received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
6:21:7/The Merarite families, by their clans, received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
6:21:8/The Israelites allocated these cities and their pasturelands to the Levites by lot, as the LORD had instructed through Moses.
6:21:9/They designated cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon, specifically naming them.
6:21:10/The descendants of Aaron, from the Kohathite families of the Levites, received the first allotment.
6:21:11/They were given the city of Arba, the ancestor of Anak, which is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with its surrounding pasturelands.
6:21:12/However, the fields and villages around the city were given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
6:21:13/So they gave the descendants of Aaron the priest Hebron (a city of refuge for those accused of manslaughter) and its pasturelands, Libnah and its pasturelands,
6:21:14/Jattir and its pasturelands, Eshtemoa and its pasturelands,
6:21:15/Holon and its pasturelands, Debir and its pasturelands,
6:21:16/Ain and its pasturelands, Juttah and its pasturelands, and Beth-shemesh and its pasturelands; nine cities in total from those two tribes.
6:21:17/From the tribe of Benjamin, they received Gibeon and its pasturelands, Geba and its pasturelands,
6:21:18/Anathoth and its pasturelands, and Almon and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:19/In total, the priests, the descendants of Aaron, received thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
6:21:20/The rest of the Kohathite Levite families received their cities by lot from the tribe of Ephraim.
6:21:21/They were given Shechem (a city of refuge for those accused of manslaughter) and its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer and its pasturelands,
6:21:22/Kibzaim and its pasturelands, and Beth-horon and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:23/From the tribe of Dan, they received Eltekeh and its pasturelands, Gibbethon and its pasturelands,
6:21:24/Aijalon and its pasturelands, Gath-rimmon and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:25/From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Taanach and its pasturelands, and Gath-rimmon and its pasturelands; two cities in total.
6:21:26/Altogether, these ten cities and their pasturelands were for the remaining families of the Kohathites.
6:21:27/To the Gershonite families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for those accused of manslaughter) and its pasturelands, and Beeshterah and its pasturelands; two cities in total.
6:21:28/From the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishion and its pasturelands, Daberath and its pasturelands,
6:21:29/Jarmuth and its pasturelands, En-gannim and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:30/From the tribe of Asher, they received Mishal and its pasturelands, Abdon and its pasturelands,
6:21:31/Helkath and its pasturelands, and Rehob and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:32/From the tribe of Naphtali, they received Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for those accused of manslaughter) and its pasturelands, Hammoth-dor and its pasturelands, and Kartan and its pasturelands; three cities in total.
6:21:33/In total, the Gershonite families received thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
6:21:34/To the Merarite families, the rest of the Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun, they gave Jokneam and its pasturelands, Kartah and its pasturelands,
6:21:35/Dimnah and its pasturelands, Nahalal and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:36/From the tribe of Reuben, they received Bezer and its pasturelands, Jahazah and its pasturelands,
6:21:37/Kedemoth and its pasturelands, and Mephaath and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:38/From the tribe of Gad, they received Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for those accused of manslaughter) and its pasturelands, Mahanaim and its pasturelands,
6:21:39/Heshbon and its pasturelands, Jazer and its pasturelands; four cities in total.
6:21:40/Thus, the Merarite families, the remaining Levites, received twelve cities by their lot.
6:21:41/In total, the Levites within the Israelite territory received forty-eight cities with their pasturelands.
6:21:42/Each of these cities included their surrounding pasturelands: this was the case for all these cities.
6:21:43/And the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their ancestors; they took possession of it and settled there.
6:21:44/The LORD provided them with peace on every side, just as he had sworn to their ancestors. None of their enemies could stand against them; the LORD handed all their enemies over to them.
6:21:45/Not one of all the good promises the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; everything was fulfilled.
6:22:1/Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
6:22:2/And said to them, "You have followed all that Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you, and have listened to my instructions in everything I commanded you:
6:22:3/You haven't abandoned your brothers all these days until now, but have fulfilled the command of the LORD your God.
6:22:4/And now the LORD your God has given your brothers rest, as he promised them: so now return, go to your homes, and to the land of your inheritance, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
6:22:5/But be very careful to follow the commandment and the law that Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to obey his commands, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
6:22:6/So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes.
6:22:7/Now to one half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given land in Bashan, but to the other half, Joshua gave land among their brothers on this side of the Jordan, to the west. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes, he blessed them,
6:22:8/And he said to them, "Return to your homes with great wealth, with a lot of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a lot of clothing: share the spoils of your enemies with your brothers."
6:22:9/And the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh left the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land they owned, as they were instructed by the LORD through Moses.
6:22:10/When they reached the regions of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance.
6:22:11/And the children of Israel heard it said, "Look, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar facing the land of Canaan, in the regions of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the children of Israel."
6:22:12/And when the children of Israel heard this, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered at Shiloh to prepare for war against them.
6:22:13/And the children of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead,
6:22:14/Along with him ten leaders, one leader from each chief family of all the tribes of Israel; each one was a head of their family among the clans of Israel.
6:22:15/And they went to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and spoke with them, saying,
6:22:16/"This is what the entire congregation of the LORD asks: What is this act of betrayal against the God of Israel? Why have you turned away from the LORD today by building yourselves an altar, intending to rebel against the LORD today?
6:22:17/Was the sin of Peor not enough for us, from which we have not yet cleansed ourselves to this day, even though a plague struck the congregation of the LORD,
6:22:18/That you must turn away from following the LORD today? And if you rebel against the LORD today, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
6:22:19/However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the LORD's possession, where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and share it among us. But do not rebel against the LORD, nor against us, by building an altar for yourselves besides the altar of the LORD our God.
6:22:20/Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, sin with the devoted thing, and wrath fell on the whole congregation of Israel? And he was not the only one who died for his sin."
6:22:21/Then the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh replied to the leaders of the thousands of Israel,
6:22:22/"The Almighty God, the LORD, the Almighty God, the LORD, he knows, and let Israel itself know; if it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today,
6:22:23/If we have built ourselves an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or if to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings on it, or if to make sacrifices of peace offerings on it, let the LORD himself demand an account.
6:22:24/But in fact, we did it out of concern for this reason, thinking, 'In the future, your children might say to our children, "What do you have to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
6:22:25/For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no share in the LORD." So your children might make our children stop fearing the LORD.
6:22:26/Therefore, we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices,
6:22:27/But as a witness between us and you, and our generations after us, that we will perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings, so your children will not say to our children in the future, "You have no share in the LORD."'
6:22:28/And we thought, if they say this to us or to our generations in the future, then we will say, 'Look at the replica of the LORD's altar, which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.'
6:22:29/Absolutely not! We would never rebel against the LORD or turn away from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle."
6:22:30/And when Phinehas the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their eyes.
6:22:31/And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this act of treachery against the LORD. Now you have saved the children of Israel from the hand of the LORD."
6:22:32/And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders, returned from the children of Reuben and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them.
6:22:33/And the report was good in the eyes of the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not speak of going up against them in battle to destroy the land where the children of Reuben and Gad lived.
6:22:34/And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar Witness: "For it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
6:23:1/After a long time, once the LORD had given Israel peace from all their surrounding enemies, Joshua became very old.
6:23:2/Joshua gathered all of Israel, including the elders, leaders, judges, and officials, and told them, "I am very old now:
6:23:3/You have witnessed everything the LORD your God has done to these nations for your sake; it was the LORD your God who fought for you.
6:23:4/Look, I have allocated these remaining nations to your tribes by lot, as your inheritance, from the Jordan to the great sea in the west, including all the nations I have defeated.
6:23:5/And the LORD your God will push them out before you and remove them from your sight; and you will take over their land, just as the LORD your God promised you.
6:23:6/So be very brave to keep and follow all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, without turning aside from it to the right or to the left;
6:23:7/Do not mingle with these nations that remain among you. Do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. Do not serve them or bow down to them.
6:23:8/But stick to the LORD your God, as you have until now.
6:23:9/The LORD has driven out great and powerful nations before you; and no one has been able to withstand you to this day.
6:23:10/A single one of you can make a thousand flee, because the LORD your God fights for you, just as He promised.
6:23:11/So be very careful to love the LORD your God.
6:23:12/If you turn away and cling to the remnants of these nations that remain among you, and if you intermarry with them and associate with them and they with you,
6:23:13/Know for sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will be traps and snares to you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you disappear from this good land the LORD your God has given you.
6:23:14/And remember, today I am following the path all the earth takes. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed. Every single one has been fulfilled; not one has failed.
6:23:15/Just as all the good things the LORD your God promised you have come to you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the bad things, until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you.
6:23:16/If you break the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the LORD's anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land He has given you.
6:24:1/Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shechem, calling the elders, leaders, judges, and officials of Israel; they came before God.
6:24:2/Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Your ancestors lived beyond the Euphrates River in ancient times, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, and they worshiped other gods.
6:24:3/I took your ancestor Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and led him through the entire land of Canaan, increasing his descendants and giving him Isaac.
6:24:4/To Isaac, I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau, I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
6:24:5/I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted Egypt with what I did there, and afterward, I brought you out.
6:24:6/I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and when you reached the sea, the Egyptians chased after your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
6:24:7/When they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea over them, and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
6:24:8/I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands so that you could take possession of their land; I destroyed them before you.
6:24:9/Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you,
6:24:10/but I refused to listen to Balaam. So he continued to bless you, and I delivered you from his hand.
6:24:11/You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands.
6:24:12/I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you, not by your sword or bow.
6:24:13/I gave you land you did not toil for, and cities you did not build, and you live in them. You eat from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.'
6:24:14/Now, fear the LORD and serve Him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
6:24:15/But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose today whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."
6:24:16/The people responded, "Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods;
6:24:17/for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our ancestors up out of Egypt, from the land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled.
6:24:18/And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, for He is our God."
6:24:19/Joshua warned the people, "You may not be able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God; He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.
6:24:20/If you abandon the LORD and serve foreign gods, He will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after He has been good to you."
6:24:21/But the people said to Joshua, "No, we will serve the LORD."
6:24:22/Joshua said, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD." "Yes, we are witnesses," they replied.
6:24:23/"Now then," said Joshua, "throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
6:24:24/And the people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and obey Him."
6:24:25/On that day, Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem, he established a statute and ordinance for them.
6:24:26/Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. He took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the LORD.
6:24:27/Joshua said to all the people, "See, this stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God."
6:24:28/Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their inheritance.
6:24:29/After these events, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
6:24:30/They buried him in the land of his inheritance at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
6:24:31/Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced all the works of the LORD that He had done for Israel.
6:24:32/The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph's descendants.
6:24:33/Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
7:1:1/After Joshua died, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who should lead us into battle against the Canaanites first?"
7:1:2/The LORD answered, "Judah shall lead. I have given the land into their control."
7:1:3/Then Judah said to his brother Simeon, "Join me in my territory to fight the Canaanites, and I will do the same for you in yours." So Simeon joined him.
7:1:4/Judah attacked, and the LORD helped them defeat ten thousand Canaanites and Perizzites in Bezek.
7:1:5/They encountered Adonibezek in Bezek, fought him, and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites.
7:1:6/But Adonibezek escaped; they chased him, captured him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
7:1:7/Adonibezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off scavenged under my table. As I did, so God has repaid me." They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.
7:1:8/The people of Judah attacked Jerusalem, captured it, killed its people with the sword, and set the city on fire.
7:1:9/Then the people of Judah fought against the Canaanites living in the hills, the Negev, and the western foothills.
7:1:10/Judah also fought against the Canaanites in Hebron (formerly called Kirjatharba), killing Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
7:1:11/Next, they went against the people living in Debir (previously Kirjathsepher).
7:1:12/Caleb announced, "Whoever captures Kirjathsepher will get my daughter Achsah as their wife."
7:1:13/Othniel, son of Kenaz and Caleb's younger brother, captured it, so Caleb gave him Achsah as his wife.
7:1:14/When she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. She dismounted her donkey, and Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"
7:1:15/She replied, "Please give me a blessing. Since you've given me land in the Negev, also give me springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
7:1:16/The descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the people of Judah into the desert of Judah, located in the Negev near Arad. There, they lived among the people.
7:1:17/Judah joined with Simeon, his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites living in Zephath, completely destroying it. Therefore, it was called Hormah.
7:1:18/Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with their territories.
7:1:19/The LORD was with Judah, enabling them to take over the hill country, but they couldn't drive out the people in the plains because they had iron chariots.
7:1:20/As Moses had promised, they gave Hebron to Caleb, who drove out the three sons of Anak from there.
7:1:21/But the tribe of Benjamin didn't drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites live there among the Benjaminites to this day.
7:1:22/The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
7:1:23/The house of Joseph sent spies to Bethel (formerly called Luz).
7:1:24/The spies saw a man leaving the city and said to him, "Show us how to get into the city, and we will show you mercy."
7:1:25/When he showed them the way into the city, they struck the city with the sword but let the man and his family go.
7:1:26/The man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and named it Luz, which is its name to this day.
7:1:27/Manasseh did not drive out the people of Bethshean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and their surrounding towns, for the Canaanites were determined to stay in that land.
7:1:28/When Israel became strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not completely drive them out.
7:1:29/Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.
7:1:30/Zebulun did not drive out the residents of Kitron or Nahalol; the Canaanites lived among them but were subjected to forced labor.
7:1:31/Asher did not drive out the residents of Accho, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.
7:1:32/So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.
7:1:33/Naphtali did not drive out the residents of Bethshemesh or Bethanath. Instead, they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the residents of Bethshemesh and Bethanath were forced to work for them.
7:1:34/The Amorites pushed the children of Dan into the mountains, not allowing them to come down into the valley.
7:1:35/However, the Amorites were determined to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. Yet, when the strength of the house of Joseph increased, they were subjected to forced labor.
7:1:36/The territory of the Amorites extended from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
7:2:1/An angel of the LORD came from Gilgal to Bochim and said, "I led you out of Egypt and brought you to the land I promised your ancestors; I vowed never to break my covenant with you.
7:2:2/You must not make any agreements with the people of this land; you should destroy their altars. Yet you haven't listened to me: why have you done this?
7:2:3/So I also said, 'I won't drive them out before you; they'll be like thorns in your side, and their gods will trap you.'
7:2:4/When the angel of the LORD said these things to all the Israelites, the people cried out loud.
7:2:5/They named that place Bochim and offered sacrifices there to the LORD.
7:2:6/After Joshua sent the people away, the Israelites went to claim their inheritance and settle in the land.
7:2:7/The people served the LORD throughout Joshua's lifetime and during the lives of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had witnessed all the great deeds the LORD had done for Israel.
7:2:8/Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten.
7:2:9/They buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
7:2:10/After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who neither knew the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.
7:2:11/The Israelites did what was evil in the LORD's sight and served the Baals.
7:2:12/They abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger.
7:2:13/They abandoned the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
7:2:14/The LORD's anger burned against Israel, and he handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they could no longer withstand.
7:2:15/Wherever they went, the LORD's hand was against them for harm, as the LORD had warned, and as the LORD had sworn to them. They were in great distress.
7:2:16/Yet the LORD raised up judges, who saved them from the hands of these raiders.
7:2:17/But they wouldn't listen to their judges; instead, they prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had obeyed the LORD's commands; they did not do so.
7:2:18/Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
7:2:19/But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
7:2:20/The LORD's anger burned against Israel, and he declared, "Because this nation has violated the covenant I laid down for their ancestors and has not listened to me,
7:2:21/I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
7:2:22/I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their ancestors did."
7:2:23/Therefore, the LORD left those nations, not driving them out quickly; he did not give them into Joshua's hand.
7:3:1/These are the nations the LORD left to test Israel, especially those who hadn't experienced the wars in Canaan;
7:3:2/This was so future generations of Israelites could learn about warfare, especially those who had no prior knowledge of it.
7:3:3/Specifically, the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the mountains of Lebanon, from Mount Baalhermon to the entrance of Hamath.
7:3:4/Their purpose was to test Israel, to see if they would follow the LORD's commands, which He had given their ancestors through Moses.
7:3:5/The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
7:3:6/They married their daughters, gave their own daughters to the sons of these people, and worshiped their gods.
7:3:7/The Israelites did wrong in the eyes of the LORD, forgot the LORD their God, and worshiped the Baals and the Asherah poles.
7:3:8/So the LORD's anger burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of Chushanrishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, and the Israelites served Chushanrishathaim for eight years.
7:3:9/But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, He raised up a deliverer for them, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.
7:3:10/The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he led Israel. He went to war, and the LORD gave Chushanrishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hands, so that he overpowered Chushanrishathaim.
7:3:11/And the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
7:3:12/Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD gave Eglon, king of Moab, power over Israel because they had done evil in the eyes of the LORD.
7:3:13/He allied with the Ammonites and Amalekites, attacked Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms.
7:3:14/So the Israelites served Eglon, king of Moab, for eighteen years.
7:3:15/But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, He raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, son of Gera, a left-handed Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with a tribute to Eglon, king of Moab.
7:3:16/Ehud made a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.
7:3:17/He presented the tribute to Eglon, king of Moab, who was a very fat man.
7:3:18/After he had presented the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried it.
7:3:19/But he himself turned back at the stone images near Gilgal and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." The king commanded silence, and all his attendants left him.
7:3:20/Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in his upper room in the cool of the day. Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you," and the king rose from his seat.
7:3:21/Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly.
7:3:22/The handle sank in after the blade, and his fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and his bowels emptied.
7:3:23/Then Ehud went out to the porch, shut the doors of the upper room behind him, and locked them.
7:3:24/After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They thought, "He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the cool house."
7:3:25/They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they found their lord dead on the floor.
7:3:26/Ehud escaped while they delayed, passed beyond the stone images, and escaped to Seirath.
7:3:27/Upon arrival, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.
7:3:28/He said to them, "Follow me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands." So they followed him, captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and allowed no one to cross over.
7:3:29/At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all strong and able-bodied men; no one escaped.
7:3:30/That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
7:3:31/After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an ox goad. He too saved Israel.
7:4:1/The Israelites once again did wrong in the eyes of the LORD after Ehud passed away.
7:4:2/So, the LORD allowed them to be conquered by Jabin, the king of Canaan, who ruled in Hazor. His army was led by Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
7:4:3/The Israelites cried out to the LORD because Sisera had nine hundred iron chariots and had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years.
7:4:4/At that time, Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lapidoth, was leading Israel.
7:4:5/She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came to her for judgment.
7:4:6/She sent for Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, "Hasn't the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you: 'Go, march to Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun?'
7:4:7/And I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and troops, to the Kishon River and give him into your hands."
7:4:8/Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go."
7:4:9/She replied, "Certainly, I will go with you. However, the honor of the victory will not be yours, for the LORD will hand Sisera over to a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.
7:4:10/Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men followed him. Deborah also went with him.
7:4:11/Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and pitched his tent near the great tree in Zaanaim, close to Kedesh.
7:4:12/They informed Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.
7:4:13/So Sisera gathered all his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the Kishon River.
7:4:14/Then Deborah said to Barak, "Get ready! This is the day the LORD will give Sisera into your hands. Hasn't the LORD gone ahead of you?" So Barak went down Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men following him.
7:4:15/And the LORD threw Sisera and all his chariots and army into confusion before Barak. Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot.
7:4:16/But Barak chased the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all Sisera's troops fell by the sword; not a single one was left.
7:4:17/Meanwhile, Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.
7:4:18/Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come in, my lord, come in with me. Don't be afraid." So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
7:4:19/He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink; I'm thirsty." She opened a container of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again.
7:4:20/He then told her, "Stand at the entrance of the tent. If anyone comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say 'No.'"
7:4:21/But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and a hammer, quietly approached him while he was fast asleep and exhausted, and drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.
7:4:22/As Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said, "Come, and I will show you the man you're looking for." When he went into her tent, there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg through his temple.
7:4:23/On that day, God subdued Jabin, the Canaanite king, before the Israelites.
7:4:24/And the power of the Israelites continued to grow stronger against Jabin, the Canaanite king, until they destroyed him.
7:5:1/Then Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang on that day, saying,
7:5:2/Celebrate the LORD for avenging Israel, when the people freely offered themselves.
7:5:3/Listen up, kings; pay attention, princes; I, yes I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praises to the LORD, the God of Israel.
7:5:4/LORD, when you left Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth shook, and the heavens poured down rain, the clouds also released water.
7:5:5/The mountains melted before the LORD, that Sinai in front of the LORD, the God of Israel.
7:5:6/During the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, and during the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted, and travelers took winding paths.
7:5:7/The people in the villages disappeared, they vanished in Israel, until I, Deborah, rose up, until I arose as a mother in Israel.
7:5:8/They chose new gods; then war was at the gates: was a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
7:5:9/My heart goes out to the leaders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Praise the LORD.
7:5:10/Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit in judgment, and walk by the road.
7:5:11/Those saved from the clash of archers at the watering places, there they will recount the righteous deeds of the LORD, the righteous deeds toward his villagers in Israel: then the people of the LORD will go down to the gates.
7:5:12/Wake up, wake up, Deborah: wake up, wake up, sing a song: arise, Barak, and take your captives, you son of Abinoam.
7:5:13/Then he made the survivors rule over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me rule over the mighty.
7:5:14/From Ephraim came those rooted against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, with your people; from Machir came down leaders, and from Zebulun those who wield the writer's pen.
7:5:15/And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak: sent into the valley on foot. Among the clans of Reuben there were great deliberations.
7:5:16/Why did you stay among the sheep pens, listening to the flutes for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there was much indecision.
7:5:17/Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan: and why did Dan remain with the ships? Asher stayed on the seashore, settling down in his harbors.
7:5:18/Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives to the death on the high fields.
7:5:19/The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no spoils of silver.
7:5:20/They fought from heaven; the stars in their paths fought against Sisera.
7:5:21/The Kishon River swept them away, that ancient river, the Kishon River. Oh my soul, you have trampled down strength.
7:5:22/Then the horse hooves were broken by the galloping, the galloping of their mighty ones.
7:5:23/Curse Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse its inhabitants bitterly; because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
7:5:24/Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be, blessed above women in the tent.
7:5:25/He asked for water, and she gave him milk; she offered cream in a noble dish.
7:5:26/She reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. Then she struck Sisera, she crushed his head, when she pierced and struck through his temples.
7:5:27/At her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still: at her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell dead.
7:5:28/Sisera's mother looked out the window, and cried through the lattice, "Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots delay?"
7:5:29/Her wise ladies answered her, indeed, she answered herself,
7:5:30/"Have they not sped? Have they not divided the plunder; a girl or two for every man; colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful embroidered garments, double-dyed garments for the necks of the plunderers?"
7:5:31/So may all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let those who love him be like the sun when it rises in its strength. And the land had peace for forty years.
7:6:1/The Israelites did wrong in the eyes of the LORD, leading the LORD to hand them over to the Midianites for seven years.
7:6:2/The Midianites overpowered Israel, forcing the Israelites to create hideouts in the mountains, caves, and strongholds due to the threat.
7:6:3/Whenever Israel planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and eastern peoples would attack them.
7:6:4/They camped against the Israelites and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza, leaving no food for Israel, not even sheep, oxen, or donkeys.
7:6:5/They came with their livestock and tents, swarming like locusts in number; they and their camels were too many to count, and they invaded the land to ravage it.
7:6:6/Israel was severely weakened because of the Midianites, and the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help.
7:6:7/When the Israelites cried out to the LORD because of the Midianites,
7:6:8/The LORD sent a prophet to the Israelites, who said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up from Egypt and freed you from the land of slavery.
7:6:9/I rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who oppressed you. I drove out your enemies and gave you their land.
7:6:10/I told you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me."
7:6:11/An angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.
7:6:12/The angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon and said, "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior."
7:6:13/Gideon replied, "Pardon me, my lord, but if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about, saying, 'Didn't the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian."
7:6:14/The LORD turned to him and said, "Go in the strength you have and save Israel from Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"
7:6:15/He said to him, "Pardon me, my lord, but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."
7:6:16/The LORD answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive."
7:6:17/Gideon replied, "If I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.
7:6:18/Please do not leave until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you." And the LORD said, "I will wait until you return."
7:6:19/Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and made bread without yeast from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and brought them out under the oak to present to him.
7:6:20/The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And Gideon did so.
7:6:21/Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared from his sight.
7:6:22/When Gideon realized that he was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!"
7:6:23/But the LORD said to him, "Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die."
7:6:24/So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
7:6:25/That same night, the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.
7:6:26/Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering."
7:6:27/So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.
7:6:28/In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!
7:6:29/They asked each other, "Who did this?" When they carefully investigated, they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did it."
7:6:30/The people of the town demanded of Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it."
7:6:31/But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, "Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar."
7:6:32/So because Gideon broke down Baal's altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal that day, saying, "Let Baal contend with him."
7:6:33/All the Midianites, Amalekites and the eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
7:6:34/Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.
7:6:35/He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.
7:6:36/Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised,
7:6:37/look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said."
7:6:38/And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.
7:6:39/Then Gideon said to God, "Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew."
7:6:40/That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
7:7:1/Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people with him, got up early and set up camp beside the well of Harod. The Midianite army was to the north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
7:7:2/And the LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many people with you for me to hand the Midianites over to you. Otherwise, Israel might claim they saved themselves by their own strength.
7:7:3/So now, announce to the people, 'Anyone who is scared or afraid should leave and go back from Mount Gilead.'" And 22,000 people left, while 10,000 remained.
7:7:4/Then the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. Whoever I tell you can go with you, will go; and whoever I tell you cannot go, will not go."
7:7:5/So Gideon took the people down to the water. And the LORD told Gideon, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink."
7:7:6/Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths, while the rest knelt down to drink water.
7:7:7/And the LORD said to Gideon, "With the 300 men who lapped the water, I will save you and hand the Midianites over to you. Let all the others go home."
7:7:8/So the people took provisions and their trumpets. Gideon sent all the other Israelites home but kept the 300 men. And the Midianite camp was below him in the valley.
7:7:9/That night, the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up and go down to the camp, because I have given it into your hands.
7:7:10/But if you're afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Phurah
7:7:11/and listen to what they are saying. Afterwards, you will be encouraged to attack." So he and his servant Phurah went down to the outskirts of the enemy camp.
7:7:12/The Midianites, Amalekites, and all the eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels were as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
7:7:13/When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling his friend about a dream. He said, "I had a dream where a barley loaf tumbled into the Midianite camp, hit a tent, and it collapsed."
7:7:14/His friend replied, "This can only be the sword of Gideon, son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given Midian and the whole camp into his hands."
7:7:15/When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. Then he returned to the Israelite camp and said, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into our hands."
7:7:16/He divided the 300 men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside.
7:7:17/Then he said to them, "Watch me and do exactly as I do. When I reach the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.
7:7:18/When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp, blow yours and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"
7:7:19/Gideon and the 100 men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.
7:7:20/The three groups blew their trumpets, smashed their jars, holding the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow them, and they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
7:7:21/They stood in place around the camp while the whole camp ran, shouting and fleeing.
7:7:22/When the 300 trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah towards Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.
7:7:23/Then the Israelites from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh rallied and chased the Midianites.
7:7:24/Gideon sent messengers throughout all of Mount Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they took control of the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.
7:7:25/They captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.
7:8:1/The men of Ephraim confronted him, asking, "Why did you treat us this way by not calling us when you went to fight the Midianites?" They argued with him fiercely.
7:8:2/He responded, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Isn't the leftover grapes of Ephraim better than the main harvest of Abiezer?
7:8:3/God has given you the victory over Midian's leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. What could I have done compared to that?" Their anger subsided after he said this.
7:8:4/Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet determined, crossed the Jordan River.
7:8:5/He asked the people of Succoth for bread for his followers, saying, "They are exhausted, and we are chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
7:8:6/The leaders of Succoth questioned, "Do you already have Zebah and Zalmunna in your grasp that we should feed your army?"
7:8:7/Gideon replied, "Once the LORD has given me victory over Zebah and Zalmunna, I will punish you with thorns and briers from the wilderness."
7:8:8/He then went to Penuel and made the same request, but the people of Penuel responded just as those of Succoth had.
7:8:9/To the people of Penuel, he said, "When I return victorious, I will tear down this tower."
7:8:10/Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all that remained of the eastern armies, since one hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.
7:8:11/Gideon took the route of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah, attacking the unsuspecting army.
7:8:12/When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, captured the two Midianite kings, and defeated their army.
7:8:13/Gideon, son of Joash, returned from battle before dawn,
7:8:14/Captured a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. He provided the names of Succoth's leaders and elders, seventy-seven in total.
7:8:15/He confronted the men of Succoth, saying, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, asking if I had captured them to justify feeding my exhausted men."
7:8:16/He took the city's elders, along with wilderness thorns and briers, and used them to teach the men of Succoth a lesson.
7:8:17/He demolished the tower of Penuel and executed the men of the city.
7:8:18/He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "Describe the men you killed at Tabor." They answered, "They looked like you, each one resembling a prince."
7:8:19/He said, "They were my brothers, my mother's sons. If you had spared them, I would not kill you."
7:8:20/He ordered his eldest son, Jether, to kill them. But the boy hesitated, afraid because he was still young.
7:8:21/Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Do it yourself, for a man's strength is measured by his actions." Gideon then killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the ornaments from their camels' necks.
7:8:22/The Israelites offered Gideon the rule, saying, "You, your son, and your grandson should rule us because you saved us from Midian."
7:8:23/Gideon replied, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The LORD will rule over you."
7:8:24/Gideon asked for a favor, "Give me the earrings from your spoils." (They had golden earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
7:8:25/They agreed, "We will gladly give them." They spread a garment and each man threw in the earrings he had taken.
7:8:26/The gold earrings he requested weighed one thousand seven hundred shekels, not counting the other ornaments, pendants, purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and the chains from their camels' necks.
7:8:27/Gideon made an ephod from the gold and placed it in Ophrah, his city. All Israel idolized it there, which became a trap for Gideon and his family.
7:8:28/Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. The land enjoyed peace for forty years during Gideon's lifetime.
7:8:29/Jerubbaal, son of Joash, lived in his own house.
7:8:30/Gideon fathered seventy sons through his many wives.
7:8:31/His concubine in Shechem also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.
7:8:32/Gideon, son of Joash, died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
7:8:33/After Gideon's death, the Israelites turned back to idolatry, worshipping the Baals and making Baal-Berith their god.
7:8:34/The Israelites forgot the LORD their God, who had saved them from all their enemies surrounding them.
7:8:35/They did not show kindness to Jerubbaal's (Gideon's) family, despite all the good he had done for Israel.
7:9:1/Abimelech, Jerubbaal's son, went to Shechem to his mother's relatives and talked with them and the entire family of his mother's father, saying,
7:9:2/"Please speak to all the men of Shechem. Which is better for you: that all seventy sons of Jerubbaal rule over you or just one? Remember, I am your own flesh and blood."
7:9:3/His mother's relatives spoke about him to all the men of Shechem, and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, saying, "He is our brother."
7:9:4/They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baalberith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers who followed him.
7:9:5/He went to his father's home in Ophrah and killed his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. However, Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived because he hid.
7:9:6/Then all the men of Shechem and the house of Millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the oak of the pillar in Shechem.
7:9:7/When they told Jotham, he stood on top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and called out to them, "Listen to me, men of Shechem, so that God may listen to you."
7:9:8/Once, the trees decided to anoint a king over them. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king.'
7:9:9/But the olive tree replied, 'Should I give up my oil, which honors both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?'
7:9:10/Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come and be our king.'
7:9:11/But the fig tree answered, 'Should I give up my sweetness and my delicious fruit to hold sway over the trees?'
7:9:12/Next, the trees said to the vine, 'Come and be our king.'
7:9:13/But the vine replied, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?'
7:9:14/Finally, all the trees said to the bramble, 'Come and be our king.'
7:9:15/And the bramble said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'
7:9:16/Now, if you have acted honestly and sincerely in making Abimelech king, and if you have treated Jerubbaal and his house well, and have repaid him appropriately for his actions;
7:9:17/(Because my father fought for you, risked his life, and rescued you from Midian's hand;
7:9:18/And today you have risen against my father's house, killed his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his servant girl, king over the men of Shechem because he is your brother;)
7:9:19/If you have acted with honesty and sincerity towards Jerubbaal and his house today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
7:9:20/But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo, and consume Abimelech.
7:9:21/Then Jotham ran away, fled, and went to Beer, living there out of fear of Abimelech his brother.
7:9:22/When Abimelech had ruled over Israel for three years,
7:9:23/God sent a spirit of discord between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem betrayed Abimelech:
7:9:24/This happened so that the violence against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come back on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem who helped him kill his brothers.
7:9:25/The men of Shechem set ambushes for him on the mountaintops and robbed everyone who passed by them. This was reported to Abimelech.
7:9:26/Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers arrived in Shechem, and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
7:9:27/They went out into the fields, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, held a festival, and went into the temple of their god to eat, drink, and curse Abimelech.
7:9:28/Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn't he Jerubbaal's son and Zebul his deputy? Serve the descendants of Hamor, Shechem's father! Why should we serve him?
7:9:29/If only this people were under my command! Then I would remove Abimelech." And he challenged Abimelech, "Increase your army and come out."
7:9:30/When Zebul, the governor of the city, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was furious.
7:9:31/He sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, "Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are inciting the city against you.
7:9:32/Now, move by night with your forces and lie in wait in the fields.
7:9:33/In the morning at sunrise, attack the city. When Gaal and his forces come out against you, do whatever you can to them."
7:9:34/So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and lay in wait near Shechem in four groups.
7:9:35/When Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, Abimelech and his forces rose from their hiding places.
7:9:36/Seeing the people, Gaal said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!" Zebul replied, "You're seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men."
7:9:37/Again Gaal spoke, "Look, there are people coming down from the center of the land, and another group is coming from the direction of the diviners' oak."
7:9:38/Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your mouth now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Aren't these the people you despised? Go out now and fight them."
7:9:39/So Gaal led the men of Shechem out and fought Abimelech.
7:9:40/Abimelech chased him, and Gaal fled before him. Many were wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
7:9:41/Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem, preventing them from living there.
7:9:42/The next day, the people went out into the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.
7:9:43/He took his forces, divided them into three groups, and lay in wait in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose against them and attacked.
7:9:44/Abimelech and the group with him charged forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate, while the other two groups attacked all who were in the fields and killed them.
7:9:45/Abimelech fought against the city all day, captured it, killed the people inside, demolished the city, and scattered salt over it.
7:9:46/When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard about this, they entered the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.
7:9:47/It was reported to Abimelech that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
7:9:48/Abimelech and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an axe, cut down a branch, lifted it onto his shoulder, and said to his men, "Quickly do what you have seen me do."
7:9:49/So each of his men also cut down a branch and followed Abimelech. They piled the branches against the stronghold and set it on fire over them. Thus, about a thousand men and women, all the people of the Tower of Shechem, died.
7:9:50/Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and captured it.
7:9:51/But there was a strong tower inside the city, and all the men and women—all the people of the city—fled to it. They locked themselves in and climbed to the tower roof.
7:9:52/Abimelech approached the tower to attack it. As he approached the entrance to burn it with fire,
7:9:53/a woman dropped a millstone on Abimelech's head, cracking his skull.
7:9:54/He quickly called to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, so people won't say, 'A woman killed him.'" So his servant ran him through, and he died.
7:9:55/When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
7:9:56/Thus, God repaid Abimelech for the evil he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers.
7:9:57/And God also made the evil of the men of Shechem fall back on their heads, and the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon them.
7:10:1/After Abimelech, Tola, the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo from Issachar, rose to defend Israel. He lived in Shamir in the hills of Ephraim.
7:10:2/He led Israel for twenty-three years, then passed away and was buried in Shamir.
7:10:3/After him, Jair, a Gileadite, took over and led Israel for twenty-two years.
7:10:4/He had thirty sons who rode on thirty young donkeys, and they owned thirty towns, known as Havothjair to this day, located in the land of Gilead.
7:10:5/Jair passed away and was buried in Camon.
7:10:6/The Israelites again did what was evil in the LORD's eyes, worshiping Baalim, Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, Zidon, Moab, the Ammonites, and the Philistines, abandoning the LORD and not serving him.
7:10:7/The LORD's anger flared against Israel, and he handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites.
7:10:8/That year, they severely oppressed the Israelites for eighteen years—all those living east of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.
7:10:9/The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to wage war against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, causing great distress in Israel.
7:10:10/The Israelites pleaded with the LORD, admitting their sin of forsaking their God and worshiping Baalim.
7:10:11/The LORD reminded the Israelites, "Haven't I rescued you from the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, and Philistines?
7:10:12/The Zidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites also oppressed you, and when you cried out to me, I saved you from their power.
7:10:13/Yet you have abandoned me and worshiped other gods. Therefore, I will not save you again.
7:10:14/Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen; let them save you in your time of trouble."
7:10:15/The Israelites responded to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do whatever you think is best, but please save us today."
7:10:16/They discarded the foreign gods among them and worshiped the LORD, and he was moved by Israel's suffering.
7:10:17/The Ammonites mobilized and set up camp in Gilead. The Israelites gathered and camped at Mizpeh.
7:10:18/The leaders and people of Gilead discussed among themselves, "Who will lead the fight against the Ammonites? He will become the leader of all the people of Gilead."
7:11:1/Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, and he was the son of a prostitute: and Gilead was Jephthah's father.
7:11:2/And Gilead’s wife had sons for him; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away, telling him, "You will not inherit in our father’s house; for you are the son of another woman."
7:11:3/So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob: and there, a group of adventurers gathered around Jephthah and followed him.
7:11:4/As time went on, the Ammonites waged war against Israel.
7:11:5/And indeed, when the Ammonites waged war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob:
7:11:6/And they said to Jephthah, "Come, and be our leader, so we can fight the Ammonites."
7:11:7/And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Didn’t you despise me and drive me out of my father’s house? Why do you come to me now when you're in trouble?"
7:11:8/And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That’s why we’re turning back to you now, so you can come with us, fight the Ammonites, and be our leader over all who live in Gilead."
7:11:9/And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me, will I really be your leader?"
7:11:10/And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD is our witness; we will do exactly as you say."
7:11:11/Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. And Jephthah repeated all his terms before the LORD in Mizpah.
7:11:12/And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, "What’s the issue between us that you have come to fight in my land?"
7:11:13/And the king of the Ammonites replied to Jephthah's messengers, "Because Israel took my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan. Now give those lands back peacefully."
7:11:14/And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites:
7:11:15/And said to him, "This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
7:11:16/But when Israel came up from Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh;
7:11:17/Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let us pass through your land.' But the king of Edom wouldn’t listen. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.
7:11:18/Then they traveled through the wilderness, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, arrived on the east side of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border.
7:11:19/And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, 'Let us pass through your land to our own place.'
7:11:20/But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon gathered all his people, camped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
7:11:21/And the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into Israel’s hands, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who lived in that country.
7:11:22/And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
7:11:23/So now that the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, should you take their land?
7:11:24/Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the LORD our God has given us, we will possess.
7:11:25/Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight them?
7:11:26/While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon for three hundred years, why didn’t you recover them during that time?
7:11:27/I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites."
7:11:28/However, the king of the Ammonites paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him.
7:11:29/Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.
7:11:30/And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, saying, "If you will indeed deliver the Ammonites into my hands,
7:11:31/then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering."
7:11:32/So Jephthah advanced against the Ammonites to fight them, and the LORD gave them into his hands.
7:11:33/He struck them down from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith—twenty cities—and as far as Abel-keramim. Thus the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.
7:11:34/When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dances. She was his only child; he had no son or daughter besides her.
7:11:35/And when he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down, and you are among those who trouble me. For I have made a vow to the LORD, and I cannot break it."
7:11:36/She said to him, "My father, if you have made a vow to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the LORD has avenged you on your enemies, the Ammonites."
7:11:37/Then she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: Leave me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and lament my virginity, I and my friends."
7:11:38/So he said, "Go." And he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went into the mountains and lamented her virginity.
7:11:39/And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did to her according to his vow which he had made. And she had never known a man. So it became a tradition in Israel,
7:11:40/That the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
7:12:1/The men of Ephraim gathered together, headed north, and confronted Jephthah, asking, "Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to join you? We will burn down your house with you inside."
7:12:2/Jephthah replied, "My people and I were in a serious conflict with the Ammonites; and when I called for your help, you didn't rescue me from their grasp."
7:12:3/Seeing that you didn't come to my aid, I risked my life and went to fight the Ammonites myself, and the LORD gave me victory over them. So why have you come to fight me today?"
7:12:4/Then Jephthah rallied all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites defeated the Ephraimites because they taunted them, calling them refugees from Ephraim living among the Ephraimites and Manassites.
7:12:5/The Gileadites secured the Jordan River crossings before the Ephraimites could escape. Whenever a fleeing Ephraimite asked to cross, the Gileadites would ask if he was an Ephraimite. If he said no,
7:12:6/they would tell him to say "Shibboleth." If he said "Sibboleth," unable to pronounce it correctly, they would seize him and kill him at the Jordan River crossings. At that time, 42,000 Ephraimites were killed.
7:12:7/Jephthah led Israel for six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
7:12:8/After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.
7:12:9/He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He sent his daughters to marry outside his family and brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. He led Israel for seven years.
7:12:10/Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
7:12:11/After him, Elon, a Zebulonite, led Israel and did so for ten years.
7:12:12/Elon the Zebulonite died and was buried in Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.
7:12:13/After him, Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, led Israel.
7:12:14/He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel for eight years.
7:12:15/Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
7:13:1/The Israelites once again did wrong in the eyes of the LORD; so the LORD handed them over to the Philistines for forty years.
7:13:2/There was a man from Zorah, of the Danite tribe, named Manoah; his wife was unable to have children.
7:13:3/An angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and told her, "You are unable to have children now, but you will become pregnant and give birth to a son.
7:13:4/So be careful, please, not to drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, or eat anything forbidden.
7:13:5/You will become pregnant and have a son whose head must not be shaved because the boy will be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth. He will start to save Israel from the Philistines."
7:13:6/The woman went to her husband and said, "A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel, very awe-inspiring. I didn't ask where he was from, and he didn't tell me his name.
7:13:7/But he told me, 'You will become pregnant and have a son. Now, don't drink wine or any alcoholic drink, nor eat anything forbidden, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth until the day he dies.'"
7:13:8/Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, saying, "Oh Lord, please let the man of God you sent come to us again and teach us what to do for the boy who is to be born."
7:13:9/God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field, but her husband Manoah wasn't with her.
7:13:10/The woman hurried to tell her husband, "He's here! The man who appeared to me the other day!"
7:13:11/Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, "Are you the man who spoke to my wife?" And he said, "I am."
7:13:12/Manoah asked, "When your words come true, what is to be the boy's rule of life, and what is his work?"
7:13:13/The angel of the LORD answered Manoah, "Your wife must do everything I have told her.
7:13:14/She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink wine or other alcoholic drinks, nor eat anything forbidden. She must do everything I have commanded her."
7:13:15/Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please stay with us, and let us prepare a young goat for you."
7:13:16/The angel of the LORD replied to Manoah, "Even if you detain me, I won't eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD." (Manoah didn't realize it was an angel of the LORD.)
7:13:17/Then Manoah asked the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?"
7:13:18/The angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding."
7:13:19/So Manoah took a young goat with a grain offering and offered it on a rock to the LORD. And the angel did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched.
7:13:20/As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.
7:13:21/The angel of the LORD did not appear to Manoah and his wife again. Then Manoah realized that he was an angel of the LORD.
7:13:22/Manoah said to his wife, "We are going to die because we have seen God."
7:13:23/But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had intended to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this."
7:13:24/The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.
7:13:25/And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
7:14:1/Samson traveled to Timnath and saw a woman there among the Philistines' daughters.
7:14:2/He returned and told his father and mother, "I've seen a Philistine woman in Timnath; get her for me as my wife."
7:14:3/His parents questioned him, "Isn't there a woman among our own people or among all our kin that you have to marry a Philistine woman?" But Samson insisted, "Get her for me. She's the one I want."
7:14:4/However, his parents didn't realize this was part of the LORD's plan, seeking an opportunity against the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at that time.
7:14:5/Samson, along with his parents, went down to Timnath. Near the vineyards of Timnath, a young lion attacked him.
7:14:6/The Spirit of the LORD empowered him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as easily as one might tear a young goat. But he didn't tell his parents what he had done.
7:14:7/He continued down and spoke with the woman, and she was right in Samson's eyes.
7:14:8/Later, when he returned to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass and found a swarm of bees and honey inside it.
7:14:9/He scooped out the honey with his hands, eating as he went. He gave some to his parents, but didn't tell them where he had gotten it from the lion's carcass.
7:14:10/Samson's father went down to the woman, and Samson threw a feast there, as was the custom for young men.
7:14:11/When the locals saw him, they brought thirty men to accompany him.
7:14:12/Samson said to them, "Let me propose a riddle. If you can solve it during the seven days of the feast, I'll give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes."
7:14:13/But if you can't solve it, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes." They agreed, "Tell us your riddle. Let's hear it."
7:14:14/He said to them, "From the eater came something to eat; from the strong came something sweet." They couldn't solve the riddle in three days.
7:14:15/On the seventh day, they pressured Samson's wife, "Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we'll burn you and your father's house. Did you invite us here to rob us?"
7:14:16/Samson's wife cried in front of him, "You must hate me! You don't really love me. You've given my people a riddle and haven't explained it to me." He replied, "I haven't even told my parents, why should I explain it to you?"
7:14:17/She cried the whole seven days of the feast. Finally, on the seventh day, he told her because she wouldn't stop nagging him. She then explained the riddle to her people.
7:14:18/Before sunset on the seventh day, the men of the town said to him, "What's sweeter than honey? What's stronger than a lion?" Samson replied, "If you hadn't plowed with my heifer, you wouldn't have solved my riddle."
7:14:19/The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him. He went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, took their belongings, and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle. Furious, he returned to his father's home.
7:14:20/But Samson's wife was given to one of his companions, who had attended him at the feast.
7:15:1/But after a while, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing a young goat. He said, "I want to go to my wife's room." But her father wouldn't let him enter.
7:15:2/Her father said, "I really thought you completely despised her, so I gave her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful? Please, take her instead."
7:15:3/Samson replied, "This time, I'm going to be blameless when I get back at the Philistines, even if it causes them trouble."
7:15:4/Then Samson caught three hundred foxes, tied them tail to tail with torches in between, and set the torches on fire.
7:15:5/After lighting the torches, he released the foxes into the Philistines' grain fields, burning up both the sheaves and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
7:15:6/When the Philistines asked, "Who did this?" they were told, "Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his friend." So the Philistines went and burned her and her father to death.
7:15:7/Samson said to them, "Since you've done this, I won't stop until I've gotten my revenge on you."
7:15:8/He attacked them fiercely, killing many, and then went to live in a cave in the rock of Etam.
7:15:9/The Philistines then invaded Judah and spread out near Lehi.
7:15:10/The men of Judah asked, "Why have you come against us?" They replied, "We've come to capture Samson, to do to him what he did to us."
7:15:11/Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?" He answered, "I only did to them what they did to me."
7:15:12/They said to him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves."
7:15:13/They assured him, "No, we'll only tie you up and hand you over to them. We won't kill you." So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
7:15:14/When he arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him, and the ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.
7:15:15/He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out, took it, and killed a thousand men with it.
7:15:16/Samson said, "With a donkey's jawbone, I've made piles upon piles. With a donkey's jawbone, I've killed a thousand men."
7:15:17/When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone and named that place Ramath Lehi.
7:15:18/Feeling very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, "You've granted this great victory by the hand of your servant. Now, am I to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
7:15:19/But God opened up a hollow place in Lehi, and water flowed out of it. When he drank, his strength returned and he revived. So he named it En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
7:15:20/And he led Israel during the time of the Philistines for twenty years.
7:16:1/Then Samson went to Gaza, saw a prostitute there, and slept with her.
7:16:2/The people of Gaza were informed, "Samson has come here." They surrounded him and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate, quietly saying, "In the morning, when it's daylight, we'll kill him."
7:16:3/Samson stayed until midnight, then he got up, took hold of the city gate's doors along with the two posts, pulled them up, bar and all, placed them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of a hill facing Hebron.
7:16:4/Later, he fell in love with a woman in the Sorek Valley named Delilah.
7:16:5/The Philistine rulers came to her and said, "Seduce him to find out where his great strength comes from and how we can overpower him, tie him up, and subdue him. Each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
7:16:6/Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength lies and how you could be tied up and subdued."
7:16:7/Samson told her, "If I'm tied up with seven fresh bowstrings that haven't been dried, I'll become weak and be just like any other man."
7:16:8/So the Philistine rulers brought her seven fresh bowstrings that hadn't been dried, and she tied him up with them.
7:16:9/Men were hiding in the room as she called out to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength remained unknown.
7:16:10/Then Delilah said to Samson, "You've made a fool of me and lied to me. Now, please tell me how you can be tied up."
7:16:11/He replied, "If I'm tied up tightly with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become weak and be just like any other man."
7:16:12/So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, then said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" while men were hiding in the room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread.
7:16:13/Delilah then said to Samson, "Until now, you've made a fool of me and lied to me. Tell me how you can be tied up." He said to her, "If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom."
7:16:14/She wove it tightly with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" He woke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom with the fabric.
7:16:15/She said to him, "How can you say 'I love you' when you don't confide in me? You've made a fool of me three times now and haven't told me where your great strength lies."
7:16:16/When she nagged him day after day with her words and pressed him, he was annoyed to death.
7:16:17/So he revealed everything to her and said, "No razor has ever been used on my head because I've been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become weak and be like any other man."
7:16:18/When Delilah realized he had told her everything, she sent for the Philistine rulers, saying, "Come back once more; he has told me everything." So the Philistine rulers returned with the money in their hands.
7:16:19/She lulled him to sleep on her lap, called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and began to subdue him. And his strength left him.
7:16:20/Then she called, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" He woke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
7:16:21/But the Philistines captured him, gouged out his eyes, and took him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze shackles, and he was forced to grind grain in the prison.
7:16:22/However, after his hair was cut, it began to grow back.
7:16:23/The Philistine rulers gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, "Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands."
7:16:24/When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain."
7:16:25/When they were in high spirits, they said, "Bring out Samson to entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They had him stand between the pillars.
7:16:26/Samson said to the boy holding his hand, "Let me feel the pillars that support the temple, so I can lean against them."
7:16:27/The temple was full of men and women; all the Philistine rulers were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.
7:16:28/Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "Sovereign LORD, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."
7:16:29/He grasped the two middle pillars on which the temple stood, bracing himself against them, one with his right hand and the other with his left.
7:16:30/And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." He pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.
7:16:31/Then his brothers and his father's household came down, took him, brought him back, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel for twenty years.
7:17:1/There was a man from the region of Mount Ephraim, named Micah.
7:17:2/He told his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were stolen from you, which you cursed and also mentioned to me, I have them; I took them." His mother then blessed him, saying, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my son."
7:17:3/After he returned the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother, she said, "I had fully dedicated this silver to the LORD on your behalf to create an engraved and a cast idol. Now, I will give it back to you."
7:17:4/Even though he gave the money back to his mother, she took 200 pieces of silver and gave them to a craftsman, who made an engraved and a cast idol out of them, and they were kept in Micah's house.
7:17:5/Micah had a shrine with gods, crafted an ephod and household idols, and appointed one of his sons to be his priest.
7:17:6/During that time, Israel had no king, and everyone did what they thought was right.
7:17:7/There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the tribe of Judah, who was a Levite and was living there.
7:17:8/This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to find a new place to live. He came to Mount Ephraim and to Micah's house while he was traveling.
7:17:9/Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" He replied, "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I'm looking for a new place to live."
7:17:10/Micah then said to him, "Stay with me, and be a father and a priest to me. I'll pay you ten pieces of silver a year, provide you with clothes, and take care of your food." So the Levite agreed to stay.
7:17:11/The Levite agreed to live with Micah, and he became like one of Micah's own sons.
7:17:12/Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in Micah's house.
7:17:13/Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest."
7:18:1/In those days, Israel had no king, and the Danite tribe was looking for a place to settle since they hadn't received their share of land among the Israelite tribes.
7:18:2/The Danites sent five brave men from their territory, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout and explore the land. They instructed them, "Go and explore the land." When they reached the hill country of Ephraim, they stayed at Micah's house.
7:18:3/While near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite man and turned to him, asking, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?"
7:18:4/He told them, "Micah has treated me this way, hired me, and I serve as his priest."
7:18:5/They said to him, "Please consult God for us to find out if our journey will be successful."
7:18:6/The priest told them, "Go in peace. The LORD is watching over your journey."
7:18:7/So the five men left and arrived at Laish, where they saw people living in safety, like the Sidonians, peaceful and secure, with no ruler to disgrace them for anything, far from the Sidonians and isolated from other people.
7:18:8/When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their people asked them, "What did you find?"
7:18:9/They replied, "Get ready to attack them! We've seen the land, and it's very good. Why wait? Don't hesitate to go and take over the land.
7:18:10/When you go, you'll find a secure people and a spacious land that God has given into your hands, a place lacking nothing on earth."
7:18:11/Then six hundred men from the Danite family, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
7:18:12/They went up and camped near Kirjath Jearim in Judah, which is why the place west of Kirjath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.
7:18:13/From there they moved on to the hill country of Ephraim and arrived at Micah's house.
7:18:14/The five men who had scouted the land of Laish told their fellow Danites, "Did you know that in one of these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a cast idol? Now you know what to do."
7:18:15/They turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him.
7:18:16/The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate.
7:18:17/The five scouts went in and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate.
7:18:18/When they entered Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast idol, the priest asked them, "What are you doing?"
7:18:19/They told him, "Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us. Be our father and priest. Isn't it better for you to be a priest for a whole tribe and family in Israel than for just one man's household?"
7:18:20/The priest was delighted, and he took the ephod, the household gods, the carved image, and joined the people.
7:18:21/So they turned and left, putting the children, livestock, and belongings in front of them.
7:18:22/When they were a good distance from Micah's house, the men in the houses near Micah's house gathered together and caught up with the Danites.
7:18:23/They called out to the Danites, who turned around and asked Micah, "What's the matter with you that you've mobilized such a group?"
7:18:24/He replied, "You've taken the gods I made, and the priest, and you've gone away. What do I have left? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'"
7:18:25/The Danites told him, "Don't raise your voice at us, or angry men might attack you, and you and your family could lose your lives."
7:18:26/The Danites continued on their way, and Micah, seeing they were too strong for him, turned back and went home.
7:18:27/They took what Micah had made, along with his priest, and came to Laish, to a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.
7:18:28/There was no one to rescue them because they lived far from Sidon and had no dealings with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived there.
7:18:29/They named the city Dan, after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel, though the city was originally called Laish.
7:18:30/The Danites set up the carved image, and Jonathan, son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, and his sons served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the land was captured.
7:18:31/They set up Micah's carved image, and it was worshiped all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
7:19:1/In those days, when Israel had no king, a Levite living on the outskirts of Mount Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
7:19:2/His concubine was unfaithful to him, and she left him to go back to her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah, where she stayed for four months.
7:19:3/The husband then went after her to talk things over and persuade her to return, bringing his servant and two donkeys with him. She took him into her father's house, and when her father saw him, he was happy to meet him.
7:19:4/Her father, the girl's father, convinced him to stay, and he stayed with him for three days, eating, drinking, and lodging there.
7:19:5/On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to leave. But the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Strengthen yourself with some food, and then you can go."
7:19:6/So they sat down and ate and drank together. The girl's father said to the man, "Please stay the night and enjoy yourself."
7:19:7/When the man got up to leave, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed another night.
7:19:8/On the fifth day, he got up early to leave, but the girl's father said, "Please refresh yourself." So they delayed until the afternoon, and they both ate.
7:19:9/When the man got up to leave with his concubine and servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, "Look, the day is almost over. Spend the night here; the day is nearly done. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning, you can get up and be on your way home."
7:19:10/But the man didn't want to stay another night. He got up and left, heading toward Jebus (which is Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
7:19:11/When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant suggested to his master, "Let's stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night."
7:19:12/But his master replied, "We won't stop in a foreign city where there are no Israelites. We'll go on to Gibeah."
7:19:13/He added, "Let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places."
7:19:14/So they went on their way, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
7:19:15/They turned off there to go and spend the night in Gibeah. When he entered the city, he sat down in the open square, but no one took them into their home for the night.
7:19:16/Then an old man came in from his work in the fields at evening. He was from the hill country of Ephraim and was staying in Gibeah, but the people there were from Benjamin.
7:19:17/When he saw the traveler in the town square, the old man asked, "Where are you going? And where do you come from?"
7:19:18/The man answered, "We're traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim, which is where I'm from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I'm going to the house of the Lord. But no one has offered to take us in for the night.
7:19:19/We have straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me, your servant, the young woman, and the young man with us. We don't need anything."
7:19:20/"You're welcome to stay with me," the old man said. "Let me take care of all your needs. Just don't spend the night in the square."
7:19:21/So he took them into his house and fed their donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.
7:19:22/While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. They pounded on the door and shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him."
7:19:23/The owner of the house went out to them and said, "No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this outrageous thing.
7:19:24/Look, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I'll bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, do not do such a disgraceful thing."
7:19:25/But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn, they let her go.
7:19:26/At daybreak, the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door, and lay there until daylight.
7:19:27/When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
7:19:28/He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But there was no answer. Then he put her on his donkey, and the man set off for home.
7:19:29/When he reached home, he took a knife, cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel.
7:19:30/Everyone who saw it said, "Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it, consider it, and decide what to do."
7:20:1/Then all the Israelites came out, and the community gathered as one, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, to seek the LORD in Mizpeh.
7:20:2/The leaders of all the people, from all the tribes of Israel, came together in the assembly of God's people, with four hundred thousand infantrymen armed with swords.
7:20:3/(The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpeh.) The Israelites then asked, "How did this terrible thing happen?"
7:20:4/The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, responded, "I went to Gibeah in Benjamin with my concubine to spend the night.
7:20:5/The men of Gibeah attacked me and surrounded the house at night, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.
7:20:6/I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel's inheritance because they committed a disgraceful act and folly in Israel.
7:20:7/Look, you are all Israelites; give your advice and decision here."
7:20:8/All the people stood as one, saying, "None of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house.
7:20:9/But now, this is what we'll do to Gibeah; we'll attack it by drawing lots.
7:20:10/We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to gather supplies for the people. That way, they can deal with Gibeah of Benjamin for all the disgrace they have done in Israel."
7:20:11/So all the men of Israel united against the city, bound together as one.
7:20:12/The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this evil that has occurred among you?
7:20:13/Now, hand over the wicked men in Gibeah so we can execute them and purge the evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites refused to listen to their fellow Israelites.
7:20:14/The Benjaminites came together from their towns to Gibeah to go to battle against the Israelites.
7:20:15/At that time, the Benjaminites from the cities numbered twenty-six thousand swordsmen, in addition to the seven hundred elite troops from Gibeah.
7:20:16/Among all these soldiers were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
7:20:17/The Israelites, excluding Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all experienced in battle.
7:20:18/The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They asked, "Who of us should go first to fight against the Benjaminites?" The LORD replied, "Judah shall go first."
7:20:19/The Israelites got up in the morning and camped against Gibeah.
7:20:20/The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and they formed battle lines against them at Gibeah.
7:20:21/The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.
7:20:22/But the Israelite troops encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the same place where they had lined up on the first day.
7:20:23/(The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and they asked the LORD, "Should we again engage in battle with our brother Benjamin?" The LORD said, "Attack them.")
7:20:24/So the Israelites approached the Benjaminites on the second day.
7:20:25/Benjamin came out against them from Gibeah the second day and cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all armed with swords.
7:20:26/Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and they wept, sitting before the LORD. They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
7:20:27/The Israelites inquired of the LORD (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
7:20:28/and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before it in those days), asking, "Should we go out once more to battle against our brother Benjamin, or should we stop?" The LORD answered, "Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands."
7:20:29/Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.
7:20:30/The Israelites went up against the Benjaminites on the third day and formed battle lines against Gibeah as before.
7:20:31/The Benjaminites came out to meet the people and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down some of the people as before, killing about thirty men of Israel on the roads, one of which leads to Bethel and the other to Gibeah through the open country.
7:20:32/The Benjaminites said, "They are defeated before us as in the first battle." But the Israelites said, "Let's flee and draw them away from the city to the roads."
7:20:33/All the men of Israel moved from their positions and lined up at Baal Tamar, while the Israelite ambush rushed out of its place on the west of Gibeah.
7:20:34/Then ten thousand select troops from all Israel advanced against Gibeah, and the battle was intense. But the Benjaminites did not realize that disaster was near.
7:20:35/The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the Israelites destroyed 25,100 Benjaminites that day, all armed with swords.
7:20:36/So the Benjaminites saw that they were beaten. The Israelites gave ground to the Benjaminites because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.
7:20:37/The ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; they advanced and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.
7:20:38/The agreed signal between the Israelites and the ambush was to make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city.
7:20:39/When the Israelites retreated in the battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty Israelites, for they thought, "Surely they are defeated before us as in the first battle."
7:20:40/But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjaminites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke to the sky.
7:20:41/Then the Israelites turned around, and the Benjaminites were terrified because they saw that disaster had come upon them.
7:20:42/Therefore, they turned their backs before the Israelites and fled toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and those who came from the cities were destroying them in their midst.
7:20:43/Thus, they surrounded the Benjaminites, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
7:20:44/Eighteen thousand Benjaminites fell, all of them valiant fighters.
7:20:45/They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and five thousand men were cut down on the highways. Then they were pursued hard to Gidom, and two thousand more were killed.
7:20:46/So that day, twenty-five thousand sword-wielding Benjaminites fell, all of them valiant fighters.
7:20:47/But six hundred men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months.
7:20:48/The Israelites turned back on the Benjaminites and struck them with the sword, including the men of every city, the animals, and everything else they found. They also set all the cities they came across on fire.
7:21:1/The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpeh, saying, "None of us will give our daughters to the Benjaminites as wives."
7:21:2/And the people went to the house of God, staying there until evening before God, crying loudly and mourning deeply.
7:21:3/They asked, "O LORD, God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today we find one tribe missing from Israel?"
7:21:4/The next day, the people got up early, built an altar, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings on it.
7:21:5/The Israelites asked, "Who among all the tribes of Israel didn't join the assembly before the LORD?" For they had made a serious oath about anyone who didn't come to the LORD at Mizpeh, saying, "They must be put to death."
7:21:6/The Israelites felt remorse for their brother Benjamin and said, "Today, one tribe has been cut off from Israel."
7:21:7/"What can we do to find wives for the remaining men, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters as wives?"
7:21:8/They asked, "Which tribe of Israel didn't come to Mizpeh to join the LORD?" And it turned out that no one from Jabeshgilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
7:21:9/When they counted the people, they found that none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead were present.
7:21:10/So the assembly sent 12,000 of their bravest men with the order, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the sword, including the women and children."
7:21:11/"This is what you must do: completely destroy every male and every woman who has slept with a man."
7:21:12/They found among the people of Jabeshgilead 400 young virgins who had not slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
7:21:13/The whole assembly sent a peaceful message to the Benjaminites at the rock of Rimmon.
7:21:14/At that time, Benjamin returned, and they were given the women of Jabeshgilead who had been spared. But there were not enough women for them.
7:21:15/The people felt sorrow for Benjamin because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.
7:21:16/Then the elders of the assembly said, "What can we do to find wives for the remaining men, since the women of Benjamin have been wiped out?"
7:21:17/They said, "The survivors of Benjamin must have heirs so that a tribe is not wiped out from Israel."
7:21:18/However, we cannot give them our daughters as wives, for the Israelites have sworn, 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin.'"
7:21:19/Then they said, "Look, there is an annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, east of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah."
7:21:20/So they instructed the Benjaminites, "Go and hide in the vineyards.
7:21:21/Watch, and when the daughters of Shiloh come out to join the dances, rush out from the vineyards, each of you grab a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
7:21:22/If their fathers or brothers come to argue with us, we'll plead with them for your sake, saying, 'Please be kind to them, because we didn't get wives for them during the war, and you didn't give them to them, so you're not at fault.'"
7:21:23/The Benjaminites did this and took wives according to their number from the women who danced, whom they kidnapped. Then they returned to their inheritance, rebuilt the cities, and lived in them.
7:21:24/The Israelites then left there at that time, each to his tribe and family, and they went out from there each to his own inheritance.
7:21:25/In those days, there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
8:1:1/Now it happened during the time when judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live in Moab with his wife and two sons.
8:1:2/The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and his two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went to Moab and stayed there.
8:1:3/Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.
8:1:4/They married Moabite women; one was named Orpah and the other Ruth. They lived there for about ten years.
8:1:5/Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
8:1:6/Naomi decided to return from Moab because she heard that the LORD had blessed his people by giving them food.
8:1:7/So she left the place where she was, along with her two daughters-in-law, and they started on the road back to the land of Judah.
8:1:8/Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.
8:1:9/May the LORD help you find peace, each of you in the home of another husband." Then she kissed them, and they all cried aloud.
8:1:10/They said to her, "No, we will go back with you to your people."
8:1:11/Naomi replied, "Go back, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Can I still have sons who could become your husbands?
8:1:12/Go back, my daughters, go on your way; I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons—
8:1:13/would you wait for them to grow up? Would you refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; it is much more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has turned against me."
8:1:14/They cried aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
8:1:15/Naomi said, "Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."
8:1:16/But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go, I will go; where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
8:1:17/Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."
8:1:18/When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
8:1:19/So the two of them continued on their journey until they arrived in Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"
8:1:20/She told them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
8:1:21/I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me?"
8:1:22/So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
8:2:1/Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, a very wealthy and influential man from Elimelech's family; his name was Boaz.
8:2:2/Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter."
8:2:3/So she went out, entered a field, and followed behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's family.
8:2:4/Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!" "The LORD bless you!" they answered.
8:2:5/Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, "Who does that young woman belong to?"
8:2:6/The overseer replied, "She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from Moab.
8:2:7/She asked, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."
8:2:8/Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen, my daughter. Don't go to glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my women workers.
8:2:9/Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."
8:2:10/At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?"
8:2:11/Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.
8:2:12/May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."
8:2:13/Then she said, "I hope I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord. You have reassured me and spoken kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants."
8:2:14/At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
8:2:15/As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Let her gather among the sheaves and don't reprimand her.
8:2:16/Also, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't scold her."
8:2:17/So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
8:2:18/She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.
8:2:19/Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.
8:2:20/Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "The LORD bless him! He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers."
8:2:21/Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my crops.'"
8:2:22/Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It's good, my daughter, that you go out with his women, so that others don't bother you in another field."
8:2:23/So she stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
8:3:1/Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, shouldn't I find a place of rest for you, so that things may go well for you?
8:3:2/And now, isn't Boaz, with whose young women you've been, a relative of ours? Look, he's winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
8:3:3/So wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes, then go down to the threshing floor. But don't let the man know you're there until he's finished eating and drinking.
8:3:4/When he lies down, note the place where he's lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He'll tell you what to do next."
8:3:5/And she replied, "I'll do everything you're telling me."
8:3:6/So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.
8:3:7/After Boaz had eaten and drunk, and he was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the grain pile. Then she came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
8:3:8/In the middle of the night, the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet!
8:3:9/He asked, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I'm Ruth, your servant. Spread your cloak over me, since you are a close relative."
8:3:10/He said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You've shown more kindness now than before because you haven't chased after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
8:3:11/Now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I'll do everything you ask, for everyone in town knows you are a woman of noble character.
8:3:12/It's true that I am a close relative, but there is a relative closer than I.
8:3:13/Stay here for the night, and in the morning, if he wants to do his duty as your relative, good; let him do it. But if he doesn't want to do his duty, then as surely as the LORD lives, I will do it. Stay here until morning."
8:3:14/So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could recognize another. And he said, "No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor."
8:3:15/He also said, "Bring me the shawl you're wearing and hold it out." When she did so, he poured six measures of barley into it and placed it on her back. Then she went into the town.
8:3:16/When she came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did it go, my daughter?" And she told her everything the man had done for her.
8:3:17/And she said, "He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
8:3:18/Then Naomi said, "Stay put, my daughter, until you find out how things turn out; for the man won't rest until he has settled things today."
8:4:1/Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. Suddenly, the relative Boaz had mentioned came by. Boaz called out to him, "Hey, come over here and sit down." So he came over and sat down.
8:4:2/Boaz gathered ten of the city's elders and said, "Sit down here." And they sat down.
8:4:3/Boaz then said to the relative, "Naomi, who has returned from Moab, is selling a piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
8:4:4/I thought I should inform you: Buy it in the presence of these townspeople and the elders. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to redeem it except you, and I am next in line." He replied, "I will redeem it."
8:4:5/Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also have to buy it from Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the deceased, to maintain the deceased's name on his inheritance."
8:4:6/The relative said, "I cannot redeem it for myself without jeopardizing my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; I cannot do it."
8:4:7/In the past in Israel, this was the procedure for redeeming and exchanging property to confirm any transaction: one party would take off his sandal and give it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.
8:4:8/So the relative said to Boaz, "Buy it yourself," and took off his sandal.
8:4:9/Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, "Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.
8:4:10/Also, I have acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, to maintain the deceased's name on his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses."
8:4:11/Then all the people at the gate and the elders said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.
8:4:12/May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman."
8:4:13/So Boaz married Ruth. She became his wife, and when he slept with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
8:4:14/The women said to Naomi, "Praise be to the LORD, who has not left you without a redeemer today. May his name become famous throughout Israel.
8:4:15/He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth."
8:4:16/Naomi took the child, held him close, and cared for him.
8:4:17/The neighborhood women named him, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
8:4:18/These are the descendants of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,
8:4:19/Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab,
8:4:20/Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,
8:4:21/Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed,
8:4:22/Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.
9:1:1/There was a man from Ramathaimzophim, in the hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
9:1:2/He had two wives; Hannah was one, and Peninnah was the other. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.
9:1:3/This man went up from his city every year to worship and offer sacrifices to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.
9:1:4/When Elkanah made his offerings, he gave portions to Peninnah and all her children.
9:1:5/But he gave a special portion to Hannah because he loved her, even though the LORD had closed her womb.
9:1:6/Hannah's rival would provoke her severely to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
9:1:7/This happened year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her, so she cried and wouldn't eat.
9:1:8/Then Elkanah, her husband, would say to her, "Hannah, why are you crying? Why don't you eat? Why are you so sad? Aren't I more to you than ten sons?"
9:1:9/After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple.
9:1:10/Deeply distressed, she prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.
9:1:11/She made a vow, saying, "LORD of hosts, if you will look on the misery of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will dedicate him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head."
9:1:12/As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
9:1:13/Hannah was praying silently; her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore, Eli thought she was drunk.
9:1:14/Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine."
9:1:15/But Hannah replied, "No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled. I have not drunk wine or strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.
9:1:16/Do not consider your servant a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation."
9:1:17/Then Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of him."
9:1:18/She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.
9:1:19/They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.
9:1:20/In due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Samuel, for she said, "I have asked him from the LORD."
9:1:21/Elkanah and his entire household went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and fulfill his vow.
9:1:22/But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "I will not go until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him so he may appear before the LORD and stay there forever."
9:1:23/Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD confirm his word." So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.
9:1:24/When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh; the child was young.
9:1:25/They slaughtered a bull and brought the child to Eli.
9:1:26/She said, "Pardon me, my lord. As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the LORD.
9:1:27/For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him.
9:1:28/Therefore I have dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
9:2:1/Hannah prayed, saying, "My heart is full of joy in the LORD, my strength is lifted high in the LORD; my mouth boasts over my enemies because I delight in your salvation."
9:2:2/There is no one as holy as the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no rock like our God.
9:2:3/Stop speaking so proudly; let no arrogance come from your mouth: for the LORD is a God who knows everything, and he weighs all actions.
9:2:4/The bows of the mighty are broken, but those who stumbled are now strong.
9:2:5/Those who were full now work for food; and those who were hungry are now satisfied: so that the barren has given birth to seven; and she who had many children is now weak.
9:2:6/The LORD takes life and gives it; he brings down to the grave and raises up.
9:2:7/The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and lifts high.
9:2:8/He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor: for the foundations of the earth belong to the LORD, and he has set the world upon them.
9:2:9/He will protect the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness; for not by strength does one prevail.
9:2:10/The enemies of the LORD will be shattered; he will thunder against them from heaven: the LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king and exalt the power of his anointed.
9:2:11/And Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the child served the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest.
9:2:12/Now the sons of Eli were corrupt; they did not know the LORD.
9:2:13/And the priest's custom with the people was that, when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand;
9:2:14/And he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.
9:2:15/Also, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant would come and say to the person offering the sacrifice, "Give meat for the priest to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
9:2:16/And if the person said to him, "Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you want," he would reply, "No, give it now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."
9:2:17/Therefore, the sin of the young men was very great in the eyes of the LORD, for they treated the LORD's offering with contempt.
9:2:18/But Samuel served before the LORD, a boy wearing a linen ephod.
9:2:19/Moreover, his mother made him a little robe and brought it to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
9:2:20/And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go to their own home.
9:2:21/And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
9:2:22/Now Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
9:2:23/He said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.
9:2:24/No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people.
9:2:25/If one person sins against another, God may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for them?" But they did not listen to their father, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.
9:2:26/And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with people.
9:2:27/A man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor's family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh's house?
9:2:28/And did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence? And did I not give to your ancestor's family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites?
9:2:29/Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'
9:2:30/Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.
9:2:31/The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line.
9:2:32/And you will see distress in my dwelling. Despite all the good that I do for Israel, there will never be an old man in your family line.
9:2:33/Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from my altar so that your eyes will fail and your heart will grieve, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.
9:2:34/And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day.
9:2:35/I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will build him a sure house, and he will walk before my anointed one always.
9:2:36/And everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, 'Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.'"
9:3:1/And the child Samuel served the LORD in the presence of Eli. The word of the LORD was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.
9:3:2/It happened at that time, when Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyesight was beginning to fail so that he could not see;
9:3:3/And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was lying down to sleep;
9:3:4/That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, "Here I am."
9:3:5/He ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back to bed." So he went and lay down.
9:3:6/Again, the LORD called, "Samuel." And Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; you called me." Eli answered, "I did not call, my son; go back to bed."
9:3:7/At this time, Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor had the word of the LORD been revealed to him.
9:3:8/And the LORD called Samuel a third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD had called the boy.
9:3:9/So Eli told Samuel, "Go, lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
9:3:10/And the LORD came, stood there, and called as before, "Samuel, Samuel." Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."
9:3:11/And the LORD said to Samuel, "Look, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle.
9:3:12/On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken regarding his family, from beginning to end.
9:3:13/For I have told him that I will judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, and he did not restrain them.
9:3:14/Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli, the guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering."
9:3:15/And Samuel lay until morning, then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision.
9:3:16/Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." He answered, "Here I am."
9:3:17/And he said, "What was it he told you? Please do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."
9:3:18/So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. And Eli said, "It is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes."
9:3:19/And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, not letting any of his words fall to the ground.
9:3:20/And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD.
9:3:21/And the LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh through the word of the LORD.
9:4:1/Samuel's message reached all of Israel. Israel went to fight the Philistines, setting up camp near Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
9:4:2/The Philistines prepared for battle against Israel, and when the battle began, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand soldiers on the battlefield.
9:4:3/When the people returned to camp, the elders of Israel wondered why the LORD had allowed them to be defeated by the Philistines. They decided to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, believing it would save them from their enemies.
9:4:4/So they sent to Shiloh to bring back the ark of the covenant of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God's covenant.
9:4:5/When the ark of the LORD's covenant arrived in the camp, all Israel raised such a loud shout that the ground shook.
9:4:6/Hearing the uproar, the Philistines wondered what the loud celebration in the Hebrew camp meant. They soon learned that the ark of the LORD had arrived in the camp.
9:4:7/The Philistines were terrified, thinking a god had come into the Hebrew camp. They said, "Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before.
9:4:8/"Woe to us! Who will save us from these powerful gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the wilderness.
9:4:9/"Be strong and act like men, O Philistines, or you'll be slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"
9:4:10/The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, with every man fleeing to his tent. It was a massive defeat; thirty thousand Israeli foot soldiers were killed.
9:4:11/The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.
9:4:12/A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield to Shiloh, arriving the same day with his clothes torn and dirt on his head as a sign of mourning.
9:4:13/When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his chair by the roadside, anxious about the ark of God. When the man entered the city and reported what had happened, the whole city was in uproar.
9:4:14/When Eli heard the outcry, he asked, "What's the meaning of this commotion?" The man hurried over to Eli to tell him.
9:4:15/Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyesight had failed so he could not see.
9:4:16/The man told Eli, "I've just come from the battlefield; I fled from it today." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?"
9:4:17/The messenger replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
9:4:18/Upon hearing the news about the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate, broke his neck, and died. He was old and heavy. He had led Israel for forty years.
9:4:19/Phinehas' wife, who was pregnant and close to giving birth, heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead. She went into labor and gave birth, for her pains came upon her suddenly.
9:4:20/As she was dying, the women attending her said, "Don't be afraid; you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay any attention.
9:4:21/She named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
9:4:22/She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
9:5:1/The Philistines captured the ark of God and took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
9:5:2/When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.
9:5:3/When the people of Ashdod got up early the next day, they saw Dagon had fallen face down on the ground before the ark of the LORD. They picked Dagon up and put him back in his place.
9:5:4/But when they got up early the next morning, Dagon had fallen face down on the ground before the ark of the LORD again; this time, Dagon's head and both his hands were broken off, lying on the threshold, leaving only the stump of Dagon.
9:5:5/So, neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone else who enters Dagon's temple in Ashdod steps on the threshold to this day.
9:5:6/But the LORD's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod; he devastated them and struck them with tumors, affecting Ashdod and its surrounding area.
9:5:7/Seeing this, the people of Ashdod decided that the ark of the God of Israel couldn't stay with them because his hand was harsh on them and on Dagon their god.
9:5:8/So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked, "What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They decided to move the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. And they moved the ark there.
9:5:9/After moving it, the LORD's hand was against the city, causing a very great destruction; he struck the men of the city, both young and old, and they developed tumors in their private parts.
9:5:10/So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God arrived in Ekron, the people cried out, "They've brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill us and our people!"
9:5:11/Therefore, they gathered all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the God of Israel back to its place, so it doesn't kill us and our people." For there was a deadly panic throughout the entire city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
9:5:12/Those who didn't die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city reached the heavens.
9:6:1/The ark of the LORD was in Philistine territory for seven months.
9:6:2/The Philistines called their priests and fortune-tellers, asking, "What should we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we can send it back to its place."
9:6:3/They replied, "If you're sending the ark of the God of Israel away, don't send it empty-handed. Definitely send a guilt offering with it. Then you'll be healed, and it will be clear why his hand hasn't been lifted from you."
9:6:4/They asked, "What guilt offering should we send back?" The answer was, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, matching the number of Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck all of you and your rulers."
9:6:5/So, you should make models of your tumors and rats that are destroying the land, and honor the God of Israel. Maybe then he'll lift his hand off you, your gods, and your land.
9:6:6/Why would you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? After he performed wonders among them, didn't they let the people go, and they left?
9:6:7/Now, make a new cart and take two milk cows that have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart but take their calves away from them.
9:6:8/Take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart. Put the gold objects you're sending as a guilt offering in a box next to it, and send it off so it can go.
9:6:9/Watch and see. If it heads toward Beth Shemesh, to its own territory, then it was he who brought this great disaster upon us. But if not, then we'll know it wasn't his hand that struck us; it was just a coincidence."
9:6:10/The men did as instructed; they took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and locked up their calves at home.
9:6:11/They placed the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box containing the gold rats and the models of their tumors.
9:6:12/The cows went straight toward Beth Shemesh, staying on the road and mooing all the way, without turning right or left. The Philistine rulers followed them to the border of Beth Shemesh.
9:6:13/The people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley when they looked up, saw the ark, and were overjoyed.
9:6:14/The cart reached the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped near a large rock. They split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
9:6:15/The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box with the gold objects and placed them on the large rock. On that day, the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.
9:6:16/When the five Philistine rulers saw this, they returned to Ekron that same day.
9:6:17/These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the LORD: one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
9:6:18/And the gold rats matched the number of all Philistine cities under the five rulers, including fortified cities and country villages. The large rock on which they placed the ark of the LORD is still in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh to this day.
9:6:19/He struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh because they looked into the ark of the LORD. He killed seventy men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter.
9:6:20/The men of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of this holy LORD God? And where can it go from here?"
9:6:21/So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to your place."
9:7:1/The people of Kirjathjearim came, retrieved the ark of the LORD, and placed it in Abinadab's house on the hill, dedicating Eleazar, his son, to guard the ark of the LORD.
9:7:2/While the ark stayed in Kirjathjearim, a considerable time passed—twenty years, during which all the people of Israel deeply missed the LORD.
9:7:3/Samuel addressed all the people of Israel, saying, "If you truly return to the LORD with all your hearts, then remove the foreign gods and Ashtaroth from among you, dedicate your hearts to the LORD, and serve him alone: and he will rescue you from the Philistines."
9:7:4/So the Israelites discarded Baalim and Ashtaroth, and devoted themselves to serving only the LORD.
9:7:5/Samuel said, "Bring all of Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf."
9:7:6/They came together at Mizpeh, drew water, poured it out before the LORD, fasted that day, and admitted, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel acted as judge for the Israelites in Mizpeh.
9:7:7/When the Philistines learned that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpeh, the Philistine rulers advanced towards Israel. Hearing this, the Israelites were terrified of the Philistines.
9:7:8/The Israelites pleaded with Samuel, "Don't stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, so that he may save us from the Philistines."
9:7:9/Samuel offered a young lamb as a complete burnt offering to the LORD; he cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel, and the LORD answered him.
9:7:10/As Samuel was presenting the burnt offering, the Philistines approached to attack Israel. But the LORD responded with a loud thunder that day, throwing the Philistines into confusion, and they were defeated by Israel.
9:7:11/The Israelites left Mizpeh, chased the Philistines, and struck them down all the way to Bethcar.
9:7:12/Then Samuel placed a stone between Mizpeh and Shen, naming it Ebenezer, and declared, "Up to this point, the LORD has helped us."
9:7:13/Thus, the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israel's territory again; the LORD's hand was against the Philistines throughout Samuel's lifetime.
9:7:14/The cities the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned, from Ekron to Gath; Israel reclaimed those territories from the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
9:7:15/Samuel served as Israel's judge for the rest of his life.
9:7:16/He traveled annually to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpeh, judging Israel in all those places.
9:7:17/He always returned to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also judged Israel and built an altar to the LORD.
9:8:1/When Samuel got old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
9:8:2/His firstborn was named Joel, and his second son was Abiah; they served as judges in Beersheba.
9:8:3/But his sons didn't follow his example. Instead, they were swayed by money, accepted bribes, and twisted justice.
9:8:4/So, all the elders of Israel came together and approached Samuel in Ramah,
9:8:5/They told him, "Look, you're getting old, and your sons aren't following in your footsteps. Now appoint a king to lead us, just like all the other nations have."
9:8:6/But they wanted a king to lead them, which upset Samuel. So he prayed to the LORD about it.
9:8:7/And the LORD told Samuel, "Listen to what the people are saying to you. It's not you they've rejected, but me, from reigning over them."
9:8:8/Just as they've done since I brought them out of Egypt, abandoning me and serving other gods, they're doing the same to you.
9:8:9/So listen to them, but warn them solemnly and explain what the reign of the king who will rule over them will entail."
9:8:10/Samuel relayed all of the LORD's words to the people who were asking him for a king.
9:8:11/He said, "This is how the king who will rule over you will operate: He will take your sons for his chariots and horses, and some will run ahead of his chariots.
9:8:12/He will appoint them as commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, to plow his ground, harvest his crops, and make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
9:8:13/He will take your daughters to be pastry chefs, cooks, and bakers.
9:8:14/He will seize your fields, vineyards, and olive groves, the best ones, and give them to his officials.
9:8:15/He will take a tenth of your grain and vineyards and give it to his officers and attendants.
9:8:16/He will take your male and female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
9:8:17/He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you will become his servants.
9:8:18/And when that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you."
9:8:19/But the people refused to listen to Samuel. "No," they said, "we want a king over us.
9:8:20/So we can be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles."
9:8:21/Samuel listened to all the people's words and repeated them to the LORD.
9:8:22/And the LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to them and give them a king." Then Samuel told the Israelites, "Everyone go back to your own town."
9:9:1/There was a man from Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of great strength.
9:9:2/He had a son named Saul, an exceptional young man, and very handsome. Among the people of Israel, there was no one more handsome than he; he stood taller than anyone else from his shoulders up.
9:9:3/Kish, Saul's father, lost his donkeys. So Kish told Saul, "Take one of the servants with you, and go look for the donkeys."
9:9:4/They went through the hill country of Ephraim and the area of Shalisha, but didn't find them. Then they went through the area of Shalim, and they weren't there. They went through the land of Benjamin, but still found no trace of them.
9:9:5/When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant with him, "Let's go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us."
9:9:6/The servant replied, "Look, in this city there's a man of God, highly respected; everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Maybe he can tell us which way to go."
9:9:7/Then Saul said to his servant, "But if we go, what can we bring the man? The food in our bags is gone, and we don't have a gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
9:9:8/The servant answered Saul again, "Look, I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I can give that to the man of God to tell us our way."
9:9:9/(Before this in Israel, when someone went to inquire of God, they would say, "Let's go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)
9:9:10/Then Saul said to his servant, "Good idea; let's go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
9:9:11/As they were going up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water and asked them, "Is the seer here?"
9:9:12/They answered, "He is; he's ahead of you. Hurry now, he just came to the city today because the people have a sacrifice at the high place.
9:9:13/As soon as you enter the city, you'll find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won't eat until he arrives, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time."
9:9:14/They went up to the city, and as they were entering, they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way to the high place.
9:9:15/The day before Saul arrived, the LORD had revealed to Samuel,
9:9:16/"Tomorrow about this time, I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will save my people from the Philistines. I have looked upon my people, for their cry has reached me."
9:9:17/When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, "This is the man I told you about; he will govern my people."
9:9:18/Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."
9:9:19/Samuel answered Saul, "I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you will eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.
9:9:20/As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, don't worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your father's family?"
9:9:21/Saul replied, "Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you say such a thing to me?"
9:9:22/Then Samuel took Saul and his servant, brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among the thirty guests.
9:9:23/Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion I gave you, the one I told you to set aside."
9:9:24/The cook lifted up the thigh and what was on it and set it before Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
9:9:25/After they came down from the high place into the city, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.
9:9:26/They got up early the next morning, and just before dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, so I can send you on your way." Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside together.
9:9:27/As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go ahead of us" (and the servant did so), "but you stay here for a while, so I can give you a message from God."
9:10:1/Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, "Isn't it because the LORD has chosen you to be the leader over his people?"
9:10:2/When you leave me today, you'll find two men near Rachel’s tomb at the border of Benjamin in Zelzah; they will tell you, 'The donkeys you were looking for have been found. And now, your father has stopped worrying about them and is anxious about you, wondering, "What should I do about my son?"'
9:10:3/Next, you'll move on from there and reach the plain of Tabor, where you'll meet three men going up to worship God in Bethel. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.
9:10:4/They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you should accept from them.
9:10:5/After that, you'll arrive at the hill of God, where the Philistine outpost is. When you get to the city, you'll encounter a group of prophets coming down from the worship place with musical instruments—a lyre, a tambourine, flutes, and a harp—playing before them, and they will be prophesying.
9:10:6/Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you'll prophesy with them, becoming a different person.
9:10:7/When these signs happen to you, do whatever the situation requires because God is with you.
9:10:8/You must go ahead of me to Gilgal; I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to present peace offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you should do."
9:10:9/And it happened that as soon as he turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart, and all those signs occurred that day.
9:10:10/When they arrived at the hill, a group of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he prophesied among them.
9:10:11/When everyone who had known him previously saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people asked each other, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9:10:12/Someone from there answered, "And who is their father?" Thus, it became a saying, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9:10:13/After he finished prophesying, he went to the worship place.
9:10:14/Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" And he said, "Looking for the donkeys. When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."
9:10:15/Saul’s uncle said, "Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?"
9:10:16/Saul replied to his uncle, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not mention anything about the kingship that Samuel had talked about.
9:10:17/And Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah;
9:10:18/And he said to the Israelites, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and from all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'"
9:10:19/"But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and distresses. And you have said, 'No, appoint a king over us.' Now, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans."
9:10:20/When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
9:10:21/Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the Matrite clan was chosen. Finally, Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.
9:10:22/So they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" And the LORD said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies."
9:10:23/They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the others from his shoulders upward.
9:10:24/And Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the one the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
9:10:25/Then Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and placed it before the LORD. Then Samuel dismissed the people, each to their own home.
9:10:26/Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by warriors whose hearts God had touched.
9:10:27/But some troublemakers said, "How can this man save us?" They looked down on him and did not bring him gifts. But Saul kept silent.
9:11:1/Then Nahash the Ammonite advanced and set up camp against Jabeshgilead. All the men of Jabesh spoke to Nahash, saying, "Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you."
9:11:2/Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I'll make a treaty with you on one condition: that I gouge out all your right eyes as a disgrace to all of Israel."
9:11:3/The elders of Jabesh responded, "Give us seven days to seek help from all over Israel. If no one comes to our rescue, we will surrender to you."
9:11:4/Then the messengers arrived in Gibeah of Saul and shared the news with the people, who all began to cry loudly.
9:11:5/And when Saul returned from the fields and saw the people crying, he asked, "What's wrong with everyone?" They told him about the situation in Jabesh.
9:11:6/Upon hearing this, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he became very angry.
9:11:7/He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces throughout Israel with messengers who said, "Anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel will have their oxen treated the same way." Fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they united as one.
9:11:8/When he counted them at Bezek, there were 300,000 from Israel and 30,000 from Judah.
9:11:9/They told the messengers to say to the men of Jabeshgilead, "By tomorrow, when the sun is hot, you will be rescued." The messengers relayed this, and the men of Jabesh were overjoyed.
9:11:10/So the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you think is best."
9:11:11/The next day, Saul divided his forces into three groups; they attacked the Ammonite camp during the early morning and fought until the day grew hot. The survivors were scattered, with no two left together.
9:11:12/Afterward, the people asked Samuel, "Who doubted that Saul should be king? Bring them out so we can kill them."
9:11:13/But Saul said, "No one will be killed today, because today the LORD has saved Israel."
9:11:14/Then Samuel said to the people, "Let's go to Gilgal and reaffirm the kingship."
9:11:15/Everyone went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD. They offered peace offerings to the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites celebrated greatly.
9:12:1/And Samuel said to all Israel, "Listen, I have listened to everything you said to me and have appointed a king over you.
9:12:2/And now, here is the king leading you. I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have served you from my youth until this day.
9:12:3/Here I am, testify against me before the LORD and his anointed: whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whom have I accepted a bribe to turn a blind eye? If so, I will make it right."
9:12:4/And they said, "You have not cheated us, nor oppressed us, nor taken anything from anyone's hand."
9:12:5/And he said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness today, that you have found nothing in my hand." And they said, "He is witness."
9:12:6/And Samuel said to the people, "It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt.
9:12:7/Now then, stand still so I can remind you before the LORD of all the righteous acts the LORD has done for you and your ancestors.
9:12:8/When Jacob entered Egypt and your ancestors cried out to the LORD, the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
9:12:9/But when they forgot the LORD their God, he handed them over to Sisera, the commander of Hazor's army, and to the Philistines, and to the king of Moab, who fought against them.
9:12:10/Then they cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned because we have abandoned the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now, deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.'
9:12:11/And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and rescued you from your enemies on every side, so you lived in safety.
9:12:12/But when you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, coming against you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king to rule over us'—even though the LORD your God was your king.
9:12:13/Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for. See, the LORD has set a king over you.
9:12:14/If you fear the LORD, serve him, listen to his voice, and do not rebel against his commands, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God.
9:12:15/But if you do not listen to the LORD's voice and rebel against his commands, the LORD's hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.
9:12:16/Now then, stand and see this great thing the LORD is about to do before your eyes.
9:12:17/Isn't it the wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD, and he will send thunder and rain. Then you will realize how much evil you did in the LORD's sight by asking for a king."
9:12:18/So Samuel called out to the LORD, and that day the LORD sent thunder and rain. All the people were greatly afraid of the LORD and of Samuel.
9:12:19/And all the people said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so we don't die, for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king."
9:12:20/And Samuel said to the people, "Do not be afraid. You have done all this evil, yet do not turn away from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
9:12:21/And do not turn away after useless things that cannot benefit or save you, for they are useless.
9:12:22/For the LORD will not abandon his people, because of his great name and because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.
9:12:23/Moreover, as for me, far be it from me to sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you. I will continue to teach you the good and right way.
9:12:24/Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart; for consider what great things he has done for you.
9:12:25/But if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away."
9:13:1/Saul had been king for one year; by the time he had ruled over Israel for two years,
9:13:2/Saul selected three thousand men from Israel; two thousand stayed with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, while a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people back to their homes.
9:13:3/Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost in Geba, and the Philistines found out about it. Saul then sounded the trumpet throughout the land, calling the Hebrews to take notice.
9:13:4/All of Israel learned that Saul had defeated a Philistine outpost and that the Philistines now despised Israel. The people then rallied behind Saul at Gilgal.
9:13:5/The Philistines assembled to fight Israel with thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They advanced and set up camp in Michmash, to the east of Bethaven.
9:13:6/Seeing they were in a tight spot, the Israelites were terrified and hid in caves, thickets, rocks, high places, and pits.
9:13:7/Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the lands of Gad and Gilead. Meanwhile, Saul remained in Gilgal, and all the people with him were shaking with fear.
9:13:8/He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel. But Samuel didn't come to Gilgal, and the people began to scatter from Saul.
9:13:9/Saul said, "Bring me a burnt offering and peace offerings." And he proceeded to offer the burnt offering.
9:13:10/Just as he finished making the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to greet him and welcome him.
9:13:11/Samuel asked, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "I saw that the people were scattering from me, you didn't arrive when expected, and the Philistines were assembling at Michmash.
9:13:12/I thought, 'The Philistines will soon attack me in Gilgal, and I haven't sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."
9:13:13/Samuel told Saul, "You've acted foolishly. You haven't followed the command the LORD your God gave you. If you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
9:13:14/But now your kingdom won't last. The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you haven't obeyed the LORD's command."
9:13:15/Then Samuel left Gilgal and went to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the troops who were still with him; they numbered about six hundred.
9:13:16/Saul, Jonathan his son, and the troops with them stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped in Michmash.
9:13:17/Three raiding parties left the Philistine camp: one headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,
9:13:18/another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim toward the desert.
9:13:19/There were no blacksmiths found throughout all the land of Israel because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise, the Hebrews will make swords or spears."
9:13:20/So all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles sharpened.
9:13:21/The price was two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes, and for repointing goads.
9:13:22/On the day of the battle, none of the troops with Saul and Jonathan had swords or spears, only Saul and Jonathan were armed.
9:13:23/The Philistine outpost moved to the pass of Michmash.
9:14:1/One day, Jonathan, Saul's son, said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he didn't tell his father.
9:14:2/Saul stayed on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron, with about six hundred men with him.
9:14:3/Ahiah, son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the Lord's priest in Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. The people didn't know Jonathan had left.
9:14:4/Between the paths Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost, there was a steep rock on one side and another on the opposite side: one was named Bozez, and the other Seneh.
9:14:5/The one facing north was opposite Michmash, and the other south, opposite Gibeah.
9:14:6/Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come, let's go to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf. For nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few."
9:14:7/His armor-bearer replied, "Go ahead with all that's in your heart. I'm with you all the way."
9:14:8/Then Jonathan said, "Look, we'll cross over toward those men and reveal ourselves to them."
9:14:9/If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' we'll stay where we are and not go up to them.
9:14:10/But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we'll climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands."
9:14:11/So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. The Philistines said, "Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes they've been hiding in."
9:14:12/The men of the outpost called to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us, and we'll teach you a lesson." Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Follow me, for the Lord has given them into Israel's hand."
9:14:13/Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.
9:14:14/In that first attack, Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
9:14:15/There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the Philistine troops. The outpost and raiding parties also panicked, and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
9:14:16/Saul's lookouts at Gibeah of Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.
9:14:17/Then Saul said to the men with him, "Muster the troops and see who has left us." When they did, they found Jonathan and his armor-bearer were missing.
9:14:18/Saul said to Ahiah, "Bring the ark of God here." At that time, the ark of God was with the Israelites.
9:14:19/While Saul was talking to the priest, the turmoil in the Philistine camp increased. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
9:14:20/Then Saul and all his men assembled and went into battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.
9:14:21/Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
9:14:22/When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.
9:14:23/So the Lord saved Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.
9:14:24/Now the Israelite troops were in distress that day because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies." So none of the troops tasted food.
9:14:25/All the troops entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground.
9:14:26/When the troops entered the forest, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put their hand to their mouth because they feared the oath.
9:14:27/But Jonathan had not heard his father bind the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand, dipped it into the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth. His eyes brightened.
9:14:28/Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father strictly bound the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be anyone who eats food today.'" That is why the troops are faint.
9:14:29/Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
9:14:30/How much better it would have been if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they found among their enemies. Wouldn't there have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"
9:14:31/They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The troops were very tired.
9:14:32/The troops pounced on the plunder, taking sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them on the ground and ate them with the blood still in them.
9:14:33/Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the troops are sinning against the Lord by eating meat with its blood." And he said, "You have broken faith. Roll a large stone over here at once."
9:14:34/And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the troops and tell them, 'Bring me each his ox or sheep, and slaughter them here and eat. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with the blood.'" So that night all the troops brought their animals and slaughtered them there.
9:14:35/Then Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first altar he built to the Lord.
9:14:36/Saul said, "Let's go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn. Let's not leave a single one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let's approach God here."
9:14:37/Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.
9:14:38/Saul said, "Come here, all you leaders of the people, and find out how this sin has occurred today.
9:14:39/As surely as the Lord lives, who saves Israel, even if it is my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of the troops said a word.
9:14:40/Then he said to all Israel, "You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." The people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
9:14:41/Therefore Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, "Why have you not answered your servant today? If the guilt is in me or Jonathan my son, Lord, God of Israel, give Urim. But if the men of Israel are at fault, give Thummim." Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the men were cleared.
9:14:42/Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was selected.
9:14:43/Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, ready to die."
9:14:44/Saul declared, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."
9:14:45/But the people said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die, who has brought about this great victory in Israel? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God today." So the people rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.
9:14:46/Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own territory.
9:14:47/So Saul took control of the kingdom of Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.
9:14:48/He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, rescuing Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.
9:14:49/Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua. The names of his two daughters were Merab, the firstborn, and Michal, the younger.
9:14:50/Saul's wife was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of his army was Abner, son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
9:14:51/Kish was Saul's father; Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel.
9:14:52/Throughout Saul's reign, there was bitter war with the Philistines. Whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.
9:15:1/Samuel also said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over his people, Israel. So now, listen carefully to what the LORD is saying."
9:15:2/"This is what the LORD of hosts says: I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he ambushed them on the way when they were coming up from Egypt.
9:15:3/"Now go and strike Amalek, and completely destroy everything they have. Do not spare them; kill men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys."
9:15:4/And Saul assembled the people, counting them in Telaim: two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah.
9:15:5/And Saul approached a city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the valley.
9:15:6/And Saul said to the Kenites, "Move away from among the Amalekites, or I will destroy you with them. You showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
9:15:7/And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt.
9:15:8/He captured Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive, and completely destroyed all the people with the sword.
9:15:9/But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, oxen, fattened animals, lambs, and all that was good. They were unwilling to destroy them completely, but everything that was worthless and weak, they completely destroyed.
9:15:10/Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,
9:15:11/"I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following me and has not carried out my commands." Samuel was distressed, and he cried out to the LORD all night.
9:15:12/When Samuel got up early to meet Saul in the morning, he was told, "Saul went to Carmel, where he set up a monument for himself, then turned and went down to Gilgal."
9:15:13/When Samuel reached Saul, Saul said, "Blessed are you by the LORD! I have carried out the LORD's command."
9:15:14/But Samuel said, "Then what is this sound of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of oxen that I hear?"
9:15:15/Saul replied, "They were brought from the Amalekites. The people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we completely destroyed the rest."
9:15:16/Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." Saul said to him, "Speak."
9:15:17/Samuel said, "Although you were once humble in your own eyes, were you not made the leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
9:15:18/And the LORD sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.'
9:15:19/Why then did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?"
9:15:20/"But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I brought back Agag king of Amalek and completely destroyed the Amalekites.
9:15:21/But the people took some of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of what was devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal."
9:15:22/Then Samuel said, "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
9:15:23/For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king."
9:15:24/Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and listened to them.
9:15:25/Now, please forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD."
9:15:26/But Samuel said to Saul, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel."
9:15:27/As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
9:15:28/Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to someone better than you.
9:15:29/And he who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human, that he should change his mind."
9:15:30/Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Yet please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."
9:15:31/So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
9:15:32/Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him in chains. And Agag thought, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9:15:33/But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
9:15:34/Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
9:15:35/And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
9:16:1/And the LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from ruling over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite because I have chosen one of his sons to be king."
9:16:2/Samuel asked, "How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me." The LORD replied, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD.'"
9:16:3/"And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do: you are to anoint for me the one I point out to you."
9:16:4/Samuel did what the LORD had told him and went to Bethlehem. The elders of the town were alarmed at his arrival and asked, "Do you come in peace?"
9:16:5/He answered, "In peace. I've come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD: consecrate yourselves and join me in the sacrifice." He also consecrated Jesse and his sons, inviting them to the sacrifice.
9:16:6/When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed stands here before Him."
9:16:7/But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."
9:16:8/Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him walk past Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."
9:16:9/Next, Jesse had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "Nor has the LORD chosen this one."
9:16:10/Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel told Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."
9:16:11/Then Samuel asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" Jesse replied, "There is still the youngest, but he is tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives."
9:16:12/So he sent for him and brought him in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, "Rise and anoint him; this is the one."
9:16:13/So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.
9:16:14/But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him.
9:16:15/And Saul's servants said to him, "Look, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you."
9:16:16/"Let our lord command his servants here to find someone who can play the harp well. When the evil spirit from God comes on you, he can play, and you will feel better."
9:16:17/So Saul said to his servants, "Find me someone who plays well and bring him to me."
9:16:18/One of the servants answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who knows how to play the harp. He is also a brave man, a warrior, speaks well, and is a fine-looking man. And the LORD is with him."
9:16:19/Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."
9:16:20/So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.
9:16:21/David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became his armor-bearer.
9:16:22/Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, "Please let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my eyes."
9:16:23/Whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his harp and play. Then Saul would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
9:17:1/The Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Shochoh in Judah, setting up camp between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
9:17:2/Saul and the Israelites also gathered and camped in the Valley of Elah, preparing to face the Philistines in battle.
9:17:3/The Philistines occupied one hillside, and the Israelites another, with a valley between them.
9:17:4/A champion named Goliath, from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall.
9:17:5/He wore a bronze helmet and was dressed in a coat of scale armor that weighed about 125 pounds.
9:17:6/He also wore bronze shin guards and had a bronze javelin slung on his back.
9:17:7/The shaft of his spear was as thick as a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed about 15 pounds. A shield bearer went ahead of him.
9:17:8/Goliath stood and shouted to the Israelite ranks, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.
9:17:9/If he can fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us."
9:17:10/Then the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel today; send me a man so that we may fight each other."
9:17:11/When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were dismayed and terrified.
9:17:12/David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah, who had eight sons. Jesse was old during Saul's reign.
9:17:13/The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the war: Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
9:17:14/David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul,
9:17:15/but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
9:17:16/Every morning and evening for forty days, the Philistine came forward and took his stand.
9:17:17/Jesse said to his son David, "Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.
9:17:18/Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them.
9:17:19/Saul and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.
9:17:20/Early in the morning, David left the sheep with a shepherd, took the supplies, and set out as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry.
9:17:21/Israel and the Philistines drew up their lines facing each other.
9:17:22/David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were.
9:17:23/As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.
9:17:24/When the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear.
9:17:25/The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. The king will enrich the man who kills him with great wealth, will give him his daughter in marriage, and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel."
9:17:26/David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
9:17:27/The people repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him."
9:17:28/When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down just to watch the battle."
9:17:29/"What have I done now?" David said. "Can't I even speak?"
9:17:30/He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.
9:17:31/What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, who sent for him.
9:17:32/David said to Saul, "Don't let anyone lose heart because of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."
9:17:33/Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth."
9:17:34/But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,
9:17:35/I went after it, struck it, and rescued the lamb from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it, and killed it.
9:17:36/Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.
9:17:37/David added, "The LORD who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."
9:17:38/Then Saul dressed David in his own armor. He put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail.
9:17:39/David strapped Saul's sword over the armor and tried to walk, but he wasn't used to them. "I can't go in these," he said to Saul, "because I'm not used to them." So he took them off.
9:17:40/He took his staff in his hand, selected five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.
9:17:41/The Philistine moved closer to attack David, with his shield bearer in front of him.
9:17:42/When the Philistine looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, glowing with health and handsome, he despised him.
9:17:43/He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
9:17:44/"Come here," the Philistine said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!"
9:17:45/David replied to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
9:17:46/Today the LORD will deliver you into my hands, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
9:17:47/All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands."
9:17:48/As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
9:17:49/Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, David slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.
9:17:50/Thus David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
9:17:51/David ran and stood over the Philistine, took hold of his sword, drew it from the sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.
9:17:52/Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
9:17:53/When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.
9:17:54/David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.
9:17:55/When Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don't know."
9:17:56/The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."
9:17:57/As David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with the Philistine's head still in his hand.
9:17:58/Saul asked him, "Young man, whose son are you?" David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."
9:18:1/After he finished speaking to Saul, Jonathan felt an immediate bond with David, loving him as he loved himself.
9:18:2/That day, Saul kept David with him and didn't let him return to his father's home.
9:18:3/Jonathan and David made a pact because of their deep love for each other.
9:18:4/Jonathan took off his robe and gave it to David, along with his clothes, his sword, his bow, and his belt.
9:18:5/David succeeded in every mission Saul sent him on, earning Saul's trust to lead the army. He was admired by all the people and Saul's staff.
9:18:6/When David returned from defeating the Philistine, women from all over Israel came out to meet King Saul, singing and dancing with joy and musical instruments.
9:18:7/As they celebrated, the women sang, "Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
9:18:8/Saul became furious, resenting the comparison. He thought, "They credit David with ten thousands and me with only thousands. What's left for him but the kingdom?"
9:18:9/From that day on, Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
9:18:10/The next day, a harmful spirit from God overwhelmed Saul, causing him to prophesy in his house while David played the harp as he did before, but Saul had a spear in his hand.
9:18:11/Saul threw the spear, thinking, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David evaded him twice.
9:18:12/Saul feared David because the LORD was with David and had left Saul.
9:18:13/So Saul sent him away and made him a commander of a thousand, and David led the troops in their campaigns.
9:18:14/David continued to act wisely in all his endeavors, with the LORD's support.
9:18:15/Seeing how wisely David conducted himself, Saul became even more afraid of him.
9:18:16/But all Israel and Judah loved David because he led them in their campaigns.
9:18:17/Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I'll give her to you in marriage. Just be brave and fight the LORD's battles." But Saul thought, "I won't lay a hand on him. Let the Philistines deal with him."
9:18:18/David responded to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"
9:18:19/But when it was time for Saul's daughter Merab to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel the Meholathite instead.
9:18:20/And Michal, Saul's daughter, fell in love with David. When Saul heard about it, he was pleased.
9:18:21/Saul thought, "I'll give her to him so she may become a trap for him, and so that the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Today you will become my son-in-law through one of my daughters."
9:18:22/Saul instructed his servants, "Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king likes you, and all his servants love you. Now become the king's son-in-law.'"
9:18:23/When Saul's servants mentioned this to David, he said, "Do you think it's a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm just a poor man and not well known."
9:18:24/And Saul's servants reported back to him, saying exactly what David had said.
9:18:25/Then Saul said, "Tell David, 'The king wants no other dowry than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul planned to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.
9:18:26/When Saul's servants relayed these words to David, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. The time had not yet expired.
9:18:27/David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. David brought their foreskins and presented them to the king to become his son-in-law. Saul then gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
9:18:28/Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
9:18:29/And Saul grew even more afraid of David, becoming his enemy for the rest of his days.
9:18:30/Whenever the Philistine commanders went out to battle, David was more successful than all of Saul's officers, making his name highly respected.
9:19:1/Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants that they should kill David.
9:19:2/But Jonathan, Saul’s son, really liked David and warned him, saying, "My father Saul is trying to kill you. So please, be careful and hide in a secret place until morning."
9:19:3/I'll go out and stand next to my father in the field where you are hiding, and I'll talk to him about you. Whatever I find out, I'll let you know.
9:19:4/Jonathan spoke highly of David to Saul his father, saying, "Please don't sin against your servant David; he hasn't wronged you, and his actions have been very beneficial for you.
9:19:5/He risked his life and killed the Philistine, and the LORD brought a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and were happy. So why would you sin by shedding innocent blood and killing David for no reason?"
9:19:6/Saul listened to Jonathan and swore, "As the LORD lives, David will not be killed."
9:19:7/Jonathan called David and told him everything. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David was in Saul's presence as before.
9:19:8/There was war again, and David went out, fought the Philistines, and defeated them decisively; they ran away from him.
9:19:9/An evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in hand, while David was playing music.
9:19:10/Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but David dodged out of Saul’s presence, and the spear stuck in the wall. David fled and escaped that night.
9:19:11/Saul also sent agents to David's house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't save your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."
9:19:12/So Michal let David down through a window, and he went, fled, and escaped.
9:19:13/Michal took an idol, laid it in the bed, put a goat's hair pillow at its head, and covered it with a cloth.
9:19:14/When Saul sent agents to capture David, she said, "He's sick."
9:19:15/Then Saul sent the agents back to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, so I can kill him."
9:19:16/When the agents entered, they found the idol in the bed with the goat's hair pillow at its head.
9:19:17/Saul asked Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and let my enemy escape?" Michal replied, "He said to me, 'Let me go; why should I kill you?'"
9:19:18/So David fled and escaped, and went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel then went and stayed in Naioth.
9:19:19/It was reported to Saul, saying, "David is at Naioth in Ramah."
9:19:20/So Saul sent agents to capture David. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and leading them, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's agents, and they also began to prophesy.
9:19:21/When Saul was told, he sent other agents, and they also began to prophesy. Saul sent agents a third time, and they also began to prophesy.
9:19:22/Then Saul himself went to Ramah, and when he arrived at the large well in Sechu, he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" Someone said, "They are at Naioth in Ramah."
9:19:23/So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he went on prophesying until he arrived at Naioth in Ramah.
9:19:24/He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in the same way, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Hence they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9:20:1/David escaped from Naioth in Ramah and confronted Jonathan, asking, "What have I done wrong? What's my crime or sin against your father that he's out to kill me?"
9:20:2/Jonathan reassured him, "Absolutely not, you won't die. Look, my father doesn't do anything, big or small, without telling me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not happening."
9:20:3/David firmly responded, "Your father knows very well that I'm in your favor, and he thinks, 'Let's not let Jonathan know this; it'll upset him.' But I swear by the living LORD and by your own life, I'm just a step away from death."
9:20:4/Jonathan then told David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it for you."
9:20:5/David said to Jonathan, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I'm supposed to dine with the king. But let me hide in the field until the evening of the third day.
9:20:6/If your father notices I'm missing, tell him, 'David urgently asked for my permission to rush to Bethlehem, his hometown, because there's an annual family sacrifice there.'
9:20:7/If he says, 'Fine,' then your servant is safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he's determined to harm me.
9:20:8/Please, show kindness to your servant, since you've brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD. But if I'm guilty of anything, kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"
9:20:9/Jonathan replied, "That's unthinkable! If I had any idea that my father was planning to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"
9:20:10/David then asked Jonathan, "But how will I know if your father answers you harshly?"
9:20:11/Jonathan said to David, "Let's go out to the field." So they both went out to the field.
9:20:12/Jonathan said to David, "By the LORD God of Israel, I'll check in with my father by this time tomorrow or the day after. If he's well-disposed towards David and I don't send you word, may God deal with me severely.
9:20:13/If my father intends to harm you, I'll let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.
9:20:14/And while I'm still alive, show me the loyalty of the LORD so I don't die.
9:20:15/And don't ever withdraw your kindness from my family—not even when the LORD has eliminated all of David's enemies from the face of the earth."
9:20:16/So Jonathan made a covenant with David's house, saying, "May the LORD hold David's enemies accountable."
9:20:17/And Jonathan made David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.
9:20:18/Then Jonathan said to David, "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and you'll be missed because your seat will be empty.
9:20:19/After three days, go quickly to the place where you hid when this all started, and stay by the stone Ezel.
9:20:20/I'll shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I'm aiming at a target.
9:20:21/Then I'll send a boy to find the arrows. If I call out to him, 'The arrows are on this side of you, pick them up,' then come back, for it's safe and there's no danger, as surely as the LORD lives.
9:20:22/But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go, for the LORD has sent you away.
9:20:23/And about the matter we discussed, remember, the LORD is witness between us forever."
9:20:24/So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.
9:20:25/Saul sat in his usual seat by the wall, Jonathan stood up, Abner sat next to Saul, and David's place was empty.
9:20:26/Yet Saul didn't say anything that day, thinking, "Something must have happened to him. He must be unclean; yes, that's it, he's unclean."
9:20:27/But the day after the New Moon, David's place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"
9:20:28/Jonathan answered Saul, "David urgently asked for my permission to go to Bethlehem.
9:20:29/He said, 'Please let me go, because our family is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me slip away to see my brothers.' That's why he hasn't come to the king's table."
9:20:30/Then Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a rebellious woman, don't I know that you've sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and the shame of your mother's nakedness?
9:20:31/As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die."
9:20:32/Jonathan asked his father Saul, "Why should he be killed? What has he done?"
9:20:33/But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him, so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.
9:20:34/Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and didn't eat anything on the second day of the month, grieving for David because his father had disgraced him.
9:20:35/The next morning, Jonathan went out to the field to meet David at the agreed time, bringing a young boy with him.
9:20:36/He told the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
9:20:37/When the boy reached the spot where Jonathan's arrow had landed, Jonathan called out to him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"
9:20:38/Then Jonathan shouted to the boy, "Hurry! Be quick! Don't stop!" Jonathan's boy picked up the arrows and returned to his master.
9:20:39/The boy knew nothing about what was going on; only Jonathan and David understood.
9:20:40/Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him, "Go, take them back to the city."
9:20:41/After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side, fell face down to the ground, and bowed three times. They kissed each other and wept together, but David wept more.
9:20:42/Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the city.
9:21:1/Then David arrived at Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech was alarmed when he saw David and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"
9:21:2/David replied to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has assigned me a task and told me not to let anyone know about the mission he has sent me on or what he has instructed me to do. I've told my men to meet me at a certain place."
9:21:3/"So, what do you have on hand? Could you give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you have available?"
9:21:4/The priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand, only holy bread. You can have it if the men have refrained from being with women recently."
9:21:5/David responded to the priest, "Indeed, we have avoided women for the past three days since I set out. The men's belongings are clean, and even though this is holy bread, it's essentially ordinary by now, especially since new bread has been consecrated today."
9:21:6/So the priest gave him the holy bread, because there was no other bread there except the showbread that had been removed from the presence of the LORD, to be replaced by fresh bread on the day it was taken away.
9:21:7/Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.
9:21:8/Then David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or sword here? I didn't bring my sword or any other weapon because the king's mission was urgent."
9:21:9/The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it. There's no other except that one." And David said, "There's none like it; give it to me."
9:21:10/That day, David fled because he was afraid of Saul, and he went to Achish, the king of Gath.
9:21:11/The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Haven't they sung about him in their dances, saying, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
9:21:12/David took these words to heart and became very afraid of Achish, the king of Gath.
9:21:13/So he pretended to be insane in their presence, acting wildly and scratching on the doors of the gate, letting saliva run down his beard.
9:21:14/Then Achish said to his servants, "Look, you can see the man is insane. Why did you bring him to me?"
9:21:15/"Do I lack madmen, that you've brought this man to act the madman in my presence? Should this man come into my house?"
9:22:1/David therefore left that place and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's family heard about it, they went down there to join him.
9:22:2/Everyone who was in trouble, in debt, or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
9:22:3/David then went to Mizpeh in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me."
9:22:4/He presented them before the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time David was in the stronghold.
9:22:5/The prophet Gad told David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Leave and go to the land of Judah." So David left and went into the forest of Hareth.
9:22:6/When Saul heard that David had been found, along with the men who were with him, (Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, holding his spear, with all his servants standing around him;)
9:22:7/Saul said to his servants standing around him, "Listen now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give each of you fields and vineyards, and make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds,
9:22:8/That you have all conspired against me, and no one tells me that my son has made an alliance with the son of Jesse, and none of you feels sorry for me or tells me that my son has incited my servant against me, to ambush me as he does today?"
9:22:9/Then Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, answered, "I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub."
9:22:10/He inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
9:22:11/Then the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his family, who were priests in Nob, and they all came to the king.
9:22:12/Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." He answered, "Here I am, my lord."
9:22:13/Saul asked him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, by giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?"
9:22:14/Then Ahimelech answered the king, "Who among all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, who obeys your orders and is respected in your household?
9:22:15/Was today the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Please don't accuse me or my family of such a thing, for your servant knew nothing about all this, big or small."
9:22:16/And the king said, "You will certainly die, Ahimelech, you and your entire family."
9:22:17/Then the king ordered the guards at his side, "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to raise their hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
9:22:18/So the king said to Doeg, "You turn and attack the priests." And Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests, killing eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
9:22:19/He also struck down Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword, killing both men and women, children and infants, and cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
9:22:20/But one son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David.
9:22:21/Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the LORD's priests.
9:22:22/David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your entire family.
9:22:23/Stay with me; don't be afraid. The one who is seeking my life is seeking yours, but with me you will be safe."
9:23:1/Then they informed David, saying, "Look, the Philistines are attacking Keilah and stealing from the threshing floors."
9:23:2/So David asked the LORD, "Should I go and defeat these Philistines?" And the LORD told David, "Go, defeat the Philistines, and save Keilah."
9:23:3/But David's men said to him, "We're already scared here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the Philistine armies?"
9:23:4/Then David asked the LORD again. And the LORD replied, "Get up, go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into your hand."
9:23:5/So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines, took their livestock, and defeated them decisively. Thus, David saved the people of Keilah.
9:23:6/When Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, fled to David at Keilah, he arrived with an ephod in his hand.
9:23:7/When Saul heard that David had gone to Keilah, he said, "God has handed him over to me, for he is trapped in a town with gates and bars."
9:23:8/And Saul summoned all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
9:23:9/David learned that Saul was plotting harm against him; he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here."
9:23:10/Then David said, "O LORD God of Israel, your servant has heard that Saul plans to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account."
9:23:11/"Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, please tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down."
9:23:12/Then David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will hand you over."
9:23:13/So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and moved from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he stopped pursuing him.
9:23:14/David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not deliver David into his hands.
9:23:15/David saw that Saul had come out to take his life; David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a forest.
9:23:16/Then Jonathan, Saul's son, went to David in the forest and encouraged him in his faith in God.
9:23:17/He told him, "Don't be afraid; Saul my father will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."
9:23:18/So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David stayed in the forest, and Jonathan went back home.
9:23:19/Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Isn't David hiding among us in strongholds in the forest, on the hill of Hachilah, south of Jeshimon?
9:23:20/"So now, O king, come down whenever you wish, and it will be our responsibility to hand him over to the king."
9:23:21/And Saul said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have shown compassion to me."
9:23:22/"Go, please, make further preparations, find out his exact place where he camps, and who has seen him there; for I'm told he is very cunning."
9:23:23/"Find out about all his hiding places and come back to me with definite information, then I'll go with you. If he's in the area, I'll search him out among all the clans of Judah."
9:23:24/So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Meanwhile, David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the arid plain south of Jeshimon.
9:23:25/Saul and his men began the search. When David was told, he went down to a rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
9:23:26/Saul was on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side. David hurried to escape from Saul, as Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
9:23:27/But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have raided the land."
9:23:28/Therefore, Saul stopped pursuing David and went to meet the Philistine threat. That's why they called that place Selahammahlekoth.
9:23:29/And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
9:24:1/When Saul returned from chasing the Philistines, he was informed, "David is hiding in the wilderness of Engedi."
9:24:2/So Saul gathered three thousand elite troops from all over Israel and set out to find David and his men among the rocky cliffs where wild goats live.
9:24:3/He arrived at some sheep pens along the way, where there was a cave. Saul went inside to relieve himself, while David and his men were hiding further inside the cave.
9:24:4/David's men whispered to him, "This is the moment the LORD spoke of, saying, 'I will give your enemy into your hands, and you can do with him as you wish.'" Then David quietly cut off a piece of Saul's robe.
9:24:5/Afterward, David felt guilty for cutting off a piece of Saul's robe.
9:24:6/He told his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, by attacking him, since he is the anointed of the LORD."
9:24:7/David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to attack Saul. Saul left the cave and continued on his way.
9:24:8/Then David also got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down with his face to the ground in respect.
9:24:9/David asked Saul, "Why do you listen to people who say, 'David is out to harm you'?
9:24:10/Today you've seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you, saying, 'I won't lay a hand on my lord, for he is the LORD's anointed.'
9:24:11/See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand. I cut off the corner of your robe but didn't kill you. This proves that I am not trying to harm you and that I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me to take my life.
9:24:12/May the LORD judge between us, and may the LORD avenge me on you, but my hand will not be against you.
9:24:13/As the old saying goes, 'From the wicked comes wickedness,' but my hand will not be against you.
9:24:14/Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea?
9:24:15/May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand."
9:24:16/When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, my son David?" And Saul wept aloud.
9:24:17/He said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me with good, whereas I have repaid you with evil.
9:24:18/You have shown today that you have treated me well; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.
9:24:19/When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you did for me today.
9:24:20/Now I know for sure that you will indeed become king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
9:24:21/Therefore, swear to me by the LORD that you will not kill off my descendants after me and that you will not wipe out my name from my father's family."
9:24:22/And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
9:25:1/Samuel passed away; and all the Israelites gathered, mourned for him, and buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
9:25:2/There was a man in Maon, who had property in Carmel; he was extremely wealthy, owning three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
9:25:3/The man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. She was intelligent and beautiful, but Nabal was harsh and mean in his actions; he belonged to the Caleb family.
9:25:4/David found out in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
9:25:5/David sent ten young men, instructing them, "Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him in my name:
9:25:6/And say to him, 'Wishing you peace, peace to your household, and peace to all that you own.
9:25:7/I've heard you have shearers. Your shepherds stayed with us, and we didn't harm them, nor did anything go missing the whole time they were in Carmel.
9:25:8/Ask your young men, and they'll confirm this. So please, let your young men be treated kindly, as we've come on a good day. Please give whatever you can to your servants and to your son David.'"
9:25:9/When David’s young men arrived, they delivered all these messages to Nabal in David's name, then waited.
9:25:10/Nabal responded to David's servants, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays, there are plenty of servants breaking away from their masters.
9:25:11/Should I take my bread, water, and meat that I've prepared for my shearers and give it to men coming from who knows where?"
9:25:12/So David's young men turned back, returned, and reported to him all these responses.
9:25:13/David told his men, "Everyone strap on your sword." So they all armed themselves, and David did as well. About four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
9:25:14/However, one of the young men informed Abigail, Nabal’s wife, "David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he screamed at them.
9:25:15/Yet these men were very good to us. We weren't harmed, nor did we miss anything during the time we spent with them while in the fields.
9:25:16/They were like a protective wall to us, both night and day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep.
9:25:17/Now think about what you should do, because harm is planned against our master and his entire household. He's such a wicked man that no one can talk to him."
9:25:18/Abigail quickly gathered two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five prepared sheep, five measures of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred fig cakes, and loaded them on donkeys.
9:25:19/She told her servants, "Go ahead of me; I'll follow you." But she didn't tell her husband Nabal.
9:25:20/As she rode on the donkey, she came down a hidden part of the hill, and there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.
9:25:21/David had said, "It was pointless to protect all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing of his was missing, and yet he repays me evil for good.
9:25:22/May God deal with David's enemies, and even more, if by morning I leave alive anyone of his who can urinate against a wall."
9:25:23/When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey, bowed before David with her face to the ground,
9:25:24/And fell at his feet, saying, "Let this wrongdoing be on me, my lord. Please let your servant speak to you and listen to what I have to say.
9:25:25/Please, my lord, pay no attention to this worthless man, Nabal. He's just like his name suggests—Nabal, which means fool, and folly follows him. But I, your servant, didn't see the young men you sent.
9:25:26/Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, since the LORD has prevented you from shedding blood and from taking vengeance into your own hands, let your enemies and those who intend harm for my lord be like Nabal.
9:25:27/And now, let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who follow my lord.
9:25:28/Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the LORD will certainly establish a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the LORD's battles, and no wrongdoing has been found in you throughout your life.
9:25:29/Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.
9:25:30/When the LORD has done for my lord every good thing he promised concerning you and has appointed you leader over Israel,
9:25:31/This will not cause grief or a troubled heart for my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has avenged himself. When the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant."
9:25:32/David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me.
9:25:33/And blessed be your good judgment, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hands.
9:25:34/For indeed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has prevented me from harming you, if you had not hurried to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by morning."
9:25:35/So David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and told her, "Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to your voice and granted your request."
9:25:36/When Abigail returned to Nabal, he was in the middle of a banquet like that of a king in his house, and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
9:25:37/But in the morning, when the effects of the wine had worn off, his wife told him these things, and his heart failed him, and he became like a stone.
9:25:38/About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
9:25:39/When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for the insult he hurled at me. The LORD has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.
9:25:40/When David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."
9:25:41/She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "Here is your servant, ready to serve and wash the feet of my lord's servants."
9:25:42/Abigail quickly got up and rode on a donkey, accompanied by her five maids. She followed David's messengers and became his wife.
9:25:43/David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.
9:25:44/However, Saul had given Michal, David's wife, to Palti, son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
9:26:1/The Ziphites came to Saul in Gibeah, saying, "Isn't David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, which faces Jeshimon?"
9:26:2/So Saul got up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand elite Israelite troops to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.
9:26:3/Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the road. Meanwhile, David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul was pursuing him there.
9:26:4/David therefore sent out scouts, and confirmed that Saul had indeed arrived.
9:26:5/And David went to the place where Saul had camped: and David saw where Saul and Abner, the son of Ner, the commander of his army, were sleeping. Saul was in the camp, with the troops encamped around him.
9:26:6/Then David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, asking, "Who will go down with me into Saul's camp?" And Abishai said, "I'll go down with you."
9:26:7/So David and Abishai went to the camp at night, and there they saw Saul sleeping inside the camp, his spear stuck in the ground near his head; Abner and the troops were sleeping around him.
9:26:8/Then Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once, and I won't need to strike him twice."
9:26:9/But David told Abishai, "Don't kill him. Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guilt-free?"
9:26:10/David also said, "As surely as the LORD lives, the LORD himself will strike him down; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
9:26:11/God forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. But please, take the spear near his head and the water jug, and let's go."
9:26:12/So David took the spear and the water jug from near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up—they were all sleeping, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.
9:26:13/Then David crossed to the other side and stood on top of a hill at a distance; there was a wide space between them.
9:26:14/And David shouted to the troops and to Abner, son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer, Abner?" Then Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?"
9:26:15/David said to Abner, "Aren't you a brave man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then didn't you protect your lord the king? Someone came into the camp to kill your lord the king.
9:26:16/What you've done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you deserve to die because you did not protect your master, the LORD's anointed. Look around. Where are the king's spear and the water jug that were near his head?"
9:26:17/Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, my son David?" And David replied, "Yes, it's my voice, my lord, O king."
9:26:18/And he said, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What wrong is in my hands?
9:26:19/Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then let him accept an offering. But if it's humans, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out today so that I can't share in the LORD's inheritance, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'
9:26:20/So now, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
9:26:21/Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, my son David. I will not harm you again because you valued my life today. I have acted foolishly and have made a great mistake."
9:26:22/And David responded, "Here is the king's spear! Let one of the young men come over and get it.
9:26:23/May the LORD repay everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed.
9:26:24/Just as your life was highly valued today in my eyes, so may my life be highly valued in the eyes of the LORD, and may he rescue me from all trouble."
9:26:25/Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David. You will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
9:27:1/David thought to himself, "I'm going to die by Saul's hand one of these days. The best thing I can do is to quickly escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up looking for me anywhere in Israel, and I'll be out of his reach."
9:27:2/David got up and crossed over with the six hundred men who were with him to Achish, son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
9:27:3/David lived in Gath with Achish, along with his men and their families. David was there with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel.
9:27:4/When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he stopped searching for him.
9:27:5/David said to Achish, "If you're pleased with me, let me live in one of the towns in the countryside. Why should I stay in the royal city with you?"
9:27:6/So Achish gave him Ziklag that day, which is why Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.
9:27:7/David lived in Philistine territory for a year and four months.
9:27:8/David and his men went up and attacked the Geshurites, the Gezrites, and the Amalekites, who had lived in the area from ancient times, extending to Shur and the land of Egypt.
9:27:9/David struck the land, sparing neither man nor woman, and took the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and clothes, then returned to Achish.
9:27:10/When Achish asked, "Where did you raid today?" David answered, "The southern area of Judah, the southern Jerahmeelites, and the southern Kenites."
9:27:11/David didn't leave any man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, thinking, "They might report on us, saying, 'This is what David did,' and this would be his practice all the time he lives in Philistine territory."
9:27:12/Achish trusted David, thinking, "He has made himself so odious to his people Israel that he will be my servant forever."
9:28:1/In those days, the Philistines gathered their armies for war to fight against Israel. Achish told David, "You must know for sure that you and your men will go out with me to battle."
9:28:2/David responded to Achish, "You will soon see what your servant can do." Achish then told David, "For this reason, I will make you my personal bodyguard forever."
9:28:3/Samuel had died, and all Israel mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his hometown. Saul had expelled those with familiar spirits and the wizards from the land.
9:28:4/The Philistines assembled and set up camp in Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and they camped in Gilboa.
9:28:5/When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was terrified, and his heart pounded with fear.
9:28:6/When Saul sought guidance from the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, neither through dreams, nor by Urim, nor through prophets.
9:28:7/Then Saul told his servants, "Find me a woman who can summon spirits, so I can go to her and ask her advice." His servants told him, "There's a woman in Endor who can do that."
9:28:8/Saul disguised himself, wearing different clothes, and went with two men at night to the woman. He said, "Please consult a spirit for me and bring up the one I name."
9:28:9/The woman said to him, "You know what Saul has done, how he has eliminated those who summon spirits and the wizards from the land. Why are you setting a trap for my life to have me killed?"
9:28:10/Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this."
9:28:11/The woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He replied, "Bring up Samuel for me."
9:28:12/When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed loudly and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
9:28:13/The king told her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman said to Saul, "I see spirits coming up from the ground."
9:28:14/He asked her, "What does he look like?" She answered, "An old man is coming up, wrapped in a robe." Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed down, face to the ground, in respect.
9:28:15/Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul replied, "I'm in great distress; the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has turned away from me. He doesn't answer me anymore, not through prophets nor dreams. That's why I've called on you, to tell me what to do."
9:28:16/Samuel said, "Why do you ask me, since the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?"
9:28:17/"The LORD has done exactly as he said through me: the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to your neighbor, David.
9:28:18/Because you did not obey the LORD's command and did not carry out his fierce anger against Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today.
9:28:19/Furthermore, the LORD will also hand over Israel along with you to the Philistines. Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also give the Israelite army into the hands of the Philistines."
9:28:20/Then Saul immediately fell full length on the ground, terrified by Samuel's words. He was completely drained of strength, for he had not eaten anything all day and night.
9:28:21/The woman came to Saul, saw that he was deeply troubled, and said to him, "Look, your servant has obeyed you. I risked my life and listened to the words you spoke to me.
9:28:22/Now please listen to your servant's advice. Let me give you some food so you can eat and have the strength to go on your way."
9:28:23/But he refused, saying, "I will not eat." However, his servants, along with the woman, persuaded him, and he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
9:28:24/The woman had a fattened calf in the house; she quickly slaughtered it. She then took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.
9:28:25/She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and left that same night.
9:29:1/The Philistines gathered all their armies at Aphek, while the Israelites camped near a spring in Jezreel.
9:29:2/The Philistine leaders moved forward in groups of hundreds and thousands, but David and his men were at the rear with Achish.
9:29:3/The Philistine princes asked, "Why are these Hebrews here?" Achish replied to the Philistine princes, "Isn't this David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me for days or years, and I've found no fault in him from the day he joined me until now?"
9:29:4/The Philistine princes were angry with him and said, "Send this man back, so he can return to the place you assigned him. He should not go with us into battle, in case he turns against us. How better to regain his master's favor than with the heads of our men?"
9:29:5/"Isn't this the David they celebrate in their dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
9:29:6/Achish called David and said, "As surely as the LORD lives, you've been trustworthy, and your actions with me in the army have been commendable. I've found nothing wrong in you from the day you arrived until now. But the lords don't approve of you.
9:29:7/So now, go back peacefully and do not upset the Philistine lords."
9:29:8/David said to Achish, "But what have I done? What have you found against me from the day I arrived until now, that I can't go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
9:29:9/Achish replied to David, "I know you're as good as an angel of God in my eyes. However, the Philistine princes have decided you can't join us in battle."
9:29:10/"So get up early in the morning with your master's servants who came with you. As soon as it's light, leave."
9:29:11/So David and his men got up early to leave in the morning and return to Philistine territory. The Philistines went on to Jezreel.
9:30:1/When David and his men arrived at Ziklag on the third day, they discovered that the Amalekites had raided the south and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag, and set it on fire.
9:30:2/They had captured the women there, not killing anyone, young or old, but took them and continued on their way.
9:30:3/So when David and his men reached the city, they saw it was destroyed by fire; and their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive.
9:30:4/Then David and his companions cried aloud in grief until they were too exhausted to cry anymore.
9:30:5/David's two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had also been captured.
9:30:6/David was deeply distressed because the people talked of stoning him, as everyone was bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.
9:30:7/David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to David.
9:30:8/And David asked the LORD, "Should I chase this raiding party? Will I catch them?" And the LORD told him, "Go after them. You will definitely catch them and succeed in the rescue."
9:30:9/So David set out with the six hundred men with him and came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind.
9:30:10/David continued the pursuit with four hundred men, while two hundred stayed behind, too exhausted to cross the Besor Valley.
9:30:11/They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink,
9:30:12/and they gave him a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins. After he ate, he regained his strength, for he hadn't eaten any bread or drunk any water for three days and nights.
9:30:13/David asked him, "Who do you belong to? Where are you from?" He said, "I'm a young Egyptian, the servant of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.
9:30:14/We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory belonging to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag."
9:30:15/David asked him, "Can you lead me to this raiding party?" He replied, "Swear to me by God that you won't kill me or hand me over to my master, and I'll take you down to them."
9:30:16/When he led David down, there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking, and celebrating because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.
9:30:17/David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels.
9:30:18/David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.
9:30:19/Nothing was missing: young or old, sons or daughters, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.
9:30:20/David also took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."
9:30:21/When David reached the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow him and had been left at the Besor Valley, they came out to meet David and the people with him. As David approached, he greeted them warmly.
9:30:22/But some troublemakers among those who went with David said, "Since they didn't go with us, we won't share the plunder we recovered with them, except for each man's wife and children. They can take them and leave."
9:30:23/David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the raiders who came against us.
9:30:24/Who will listen to what you're saying? The share of the one who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of the one who went down to the battle. All will share alike."
9:30:25/And from that day on, David made this a rule and a right for Israel that continues to this day.
9:30:26/When David returned to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, "Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies."
9:30:27/He sent it to those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, Jattir,
9:30:28/Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,
9:30:29/Rachal, the towns of the Jerahmeelites, the towns of the Kenites,
9:30:30/Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach,
9:30:31/and Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men had roamed.
9:31:1/The Philistines attacked Israel, and the Israelite soldiers fled from them, falling dead on Mount Gilboa.
9:31:2/The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons closely, killing Jonathan, Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.
9:31:3/The battle turned against Saul, and he was severely injured by archers.
9:31:4/Saul then told his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it; otherwise, these uncircumcised men will come and kill me and mistreat my body." But his armor-bearer was too terrified to do it. So, Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
9:31:5/When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died alongside him.
9:31:6/Thus, Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that day.
9:31:7/When the Israelites on the other side of the valley and beyond the Jordan saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and ran away; the Philistines then came and occupied them.
9:31:8/The next day, when the Philistines came to loot the bodies, they found Saul and his three sons dead on Mount Gilboa.
9:31:9/They cut off Saul's head, stripped his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temples of their gods and among their people.
9:31:10/They placed his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth and hung his body on the wall of Bethshan.
9:31:11/When the people of Jabeshgilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
9:31:12/All the brave men set out, traveled all night, and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Bethshan. They brought them back to Jabesh and cremated them there.
9:31:13/Then they collected their bones, buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted for seven days.
10:1:1/After Saul's death, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites and had stayed two days in Ziklag;
10:1:2/On the third day, a man arrived from Saul's camp with torn clothes and dirt on his head. When he reached David, he fell to the ground in respect.
10:1:3/David asked him, "Where are you coming from?" He replied, "I've escaped from the Israelite camp."
10:1:4/David inquired, "What happened? Please tell me." He said, "The army fled from battle, many are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."
10:1:5/David asked the messenger, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?"
10:1:6/The messenger answered, "I accidentally came upon Saul on Mount Gilboa, leaning on his spear, with enemy chariots and horsemen closing in on him."
10:1:7/When he saw me, he called out to me, and I responded, 'I'm here.'
10:1:8/He asked me, 'Who are you?' and I told him, 'I'm an Amalekite.'
10:1:9/Then he said, 'Please stand over me and kill me; I'm in agony but still alive.'
10:1:10/So I killed him because I was certain he wouldn't survive his fall. I then took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm to bring them here to you.
10:1:11/David and all the men with him then tore their clothes in grief.
10:1:12/They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, Jonathan, the LORD's people, and the nation of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.
10:1:13/David asked the messenger, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I'm the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."
10:1:14/David questioned him, "Weren't you afraid to lift your hand against the LORD's anointed?"
10:1:15/David then ordered one of his men, "Come here and kill him." And the man struck him down, and he died.
10:1:16/David told him, "Your blood is on your own head. Your own mouth condemned you, saying, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'"
10:1:17/David mourned deeply for Saul and Jonathan.
10:1:18/He also ordered that the people of Judah be taught archery, as it is written in the Book of Jasher.
10:1:19/Israel's glory lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!
10:1:20/Do not announce it in Gath, do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the Philistine women rejoice, lest the women of the uncircumcised celebrate.
10:1:21/May you have no dew or rain, Mount Gilboa, nor fields that yield offerings. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, Saul's shield, as if he had not been anointed with oil.
10:1:22/Amid the blood of the slain, amid the fat of the mighty, Jonathan's bow did not turn back, nor did Saul's sword return empty.
10:1:23/Saul and Jonathan, in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
10:1:24/Women of Israel, weep for Saul, who dressed you in luxurious red, who adorned your garments with gold ornaments.
10:1:25/How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan, you were slain on your high places.
10:1:26/I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women.
10:1:27/How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished!
10:2:1/After this, David asked the LORD, "Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" The LORD replied, "Go up." David asked, "Where should I go?" He answered, "To Hebron."
10:2:2/So David went there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel.
10:2:3/David also brought his men and their families, and they settled in the cities around Hebron.
10:2:4/The people of Judah came to Hebron and there they crowned David king over the tribe of Judah. They informed David, "The men of Jabesh-gilead were the ones who buried Saul."
10:2:5/David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, telling them, "May you be blessed by the LORD for showing such loyalty to your lord Saul by burying him.
10:2:6/May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will reward you for this act because you have done this.
10:2:7/So now, be strong and brave, for your master Saul is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me as their king."
10:2:8/But Abner, son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, took Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and made him cross over to Mahanaim;
10:2:9/And he declared him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel.
10:2:10/Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he ruled for two years. However, the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David.
10:2:11/David was king in Hebron over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months.
10:2:12/Abner, son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth, Saul's son, left Mahanaim for Gibeon.
10:2:13/Joab, son of Zeruiah, and David's servants went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the opposite side.
10:2:14/Abner suggested to Joab, "Let the young men get up and compete in front of us." Joab agreed, "Let them get up."
10:2:15/So twelve men from Benjamin, loyal to Ishbosheth son of Saul, and twelve of David's servants got up and crossed over.
10:2:16/Each one grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent's side; so they fell down together. Therefore, that place was named Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
10:2:17/That day saw a fierce battle, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's servants.
10:2:18/The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast as a wild gazelle.
10:2:19/Asahel chased after Abner, not veering to the right or the left in his pursuit.
10:2:20/Abner looked back and asked, "Are you Asahel?" He replied, "Yes, I am."
10:2:21/Abner warned him, "Turn aside to your right or left, seize one of the young men, and take his armor." But Asahel refused to stop chasing him.
10:2:22/Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop following me! Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I face your brother Joab?"
10:2:23/But Asahel refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt end of his spear, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. Everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell and died stood still in shock.
10:2:24/Joab and Abishai continued to pursue Abner. As the sun was setting, they arrived at the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the road to the desert of Gibeon.
10:2:25/The Benjaminites rallied behind Abner, forming a single group, and took a stand on the top of a hill.
10:2:26/Then Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your people to stop pursuing their brothers?"
10:2:27/Joab answered, "As God lives, if you hadn't spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning."
10:2:28/So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops stopped. They no longer pursued Israel, nor did they continue to fight.
10:2:29/Abner and his men traveled through the Arabah all that night, crossed the Jordan, marched through the whole morning, and arrived at Mahanaim.
10:2:30/Joab stopped pursuing Abner and gathered all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were missing.
10:2:31/But David's servants had struck down three hundred and sixty men from Benjamin and Abner's forces.
10:2:32/They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched through the night and reached Hebron at dawn.
10:3:1/There was a prolonged conflict between Saul's family and David's family: but David's power grew stronger, while Saul's family became weaker.
10:3:2/David had several sons born to him in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, with Ahinoam from Jezreel; 
10:3:3/His second son was Chileab, with Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel; the third was Absalom, son of Maacah, the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; 
10:3:4/The fourth was Adonijah, son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah, son of Abital; 
10:3:5/And the sixth, Ithream, with Eglah, David’s wife. These sons were born to David in Hebron.
10:3:6/During the conflict between Saul's family and David's, Abner strengthened his position in Saul's family.
10:3:7/Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. Ishbosheth confronted Abner, asking why he had slept with his father's concubine.
10:3:8/Abner was furious at Ishbosheth's accusation and said, "Am I a traitor to Judah? Today I show loyalty to Saul's family, your father, his brothers, and friends, and haven't handed you over to David, yet you accuse me over this woman?
10:3:9/May God deal with me, severely if I don't fulfill what the LORD has promised David by transferring the kingdom from Saul's family to establish David's rule over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."
10:3:10/To shift the kingdom from Saul's family and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.
10:3:11/Ishbosheth couldn't respond to Abner because he was afraid of him.
10:3:12/Abner sent messengers to David, proposing, "Who owns the land? Make an alliance with me, and I will help bring all Israel to you."
10:3:13/David agreed, with one condition: "You won't see me unless you bring Michal, Saul's daughter, to me when you come."
10:3:14/David demanded Ishbosheth send him Michal, whom he had married for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.
10:3:15/Ishbosheth complied and took her from her husband, Phaltiel son of Laish.
10:3:16/Her husband followed her, weeping, until Abner told him to go back, and he did.
10:3:17/Abner spoke with Israel's elders, reminding them of their past desire for David to be king.
10:3:18/"Now is the time," Abner said, "for the LORD has promised David will rescue Israel from the Philistines and all their enemies."
10:3:19/Abner also spoke to the tribe of Benjamin and then went to inform David in Hebron of what was acceptable to Israel and the Benjaminites.
10:3:20/Abner visited David in Hebron with twenty men. David hosted a feast for them.
10:3:21/Abner promised David, "I will gather all Israel to my lord the king, so they can make an alliance with you, and you can rule over everything you desire." David then let Abner leave in peace.
10:3:22/While David's men and Joab were away on a raid, bringing back great spoils, Abner left Hebron peacefully after meeting with David.
10:3:23/Upon their return, Joab and his troops were informed that Abner had visited the king, who had let him leave peacefully.
10:3:24/Joab confronted David, "Why did you let Abner go? Now he's escaped!
10:3:25/You know Abner came to deceive you, to find out your movements and everything you're doing."
10:3:26/After leaving David, Joab sent messengers to bring Abner back without David's knowledge.
10:3:27/When Abner returned, Joab took him aside and killed him to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel.
10:3:28/David declared, "I and my kingdom are innocent before the LORD forever of Abner's blood."
10:3:29/"May the guilt fall on Joab and his family forever. May his family never be without someone who has a discharge, or leprosy, or leans on a crutch, or dies by the sword, or lacks food."
10:3:30/Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in battle at Gibeon.
10:3:31/David ordered Joab and all the people with him to tear their clothes, wear sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. David himself walked behind the bier.
10:3:32/They buried Abner in Hebron. David wept loudly at Abner's grave, and all the people wept too.
10:3:33/David mourned for Abner, saying, "Should Abner have died as a criminal dies?
10:3:34/Your hands were not tied, your feet not bound. You fell as one falls before wicked men." And all the people wept for him again.
10:3:35/David refused to eat until sunset, swearing, "May God deal with me, severely if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets."
10:3:36/The people were impressed by this, and everything the king did pleased them.
10:3:37/That day, all the people and all Israel realized that it was not the king's intention to kill Abner, son of Ner.
10:3:38/David said to his servants, "Don't you realize that a great leader and a great man has fallen in Israel today?
10:3:39/And today, even though I am the anointed king, I feel weak. These sons of Zeruiah are too much for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness."
10:4:1/When Saul's son found out that Abner had died in Hebron, he became weak, and all the Israelites were distressed.
10:4:2/Saul's son had two men who were leaders of troops: one was named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, from the tribe of Benjamin: (since Beeroth was also considered part of Benjamin.
10:4:3/The people from Beeroth fled to Gittaim and lived there as foreigners until today.)
10:4:4/Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was disabled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up and fled. In her hurry to escape, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.
10:4:5/Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went and arrived at the house of Ishbosheth during the hottest part of the day while he was taking a nap.
10:4:6/They entered the house pretending to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach; then Rechab and Baanah, his brother, escaped.
10:4:7/When they entered the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They attacked him, killed him, beheaded him, took his head, and traveled through the plain all night.
10:4:8/They brought Ishbosheth's head to David in Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy who wanted to kill you. Today, the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his descendants."
10:4:9/David responded to Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me from all trouble,
10:4:10/When someone told me, 'Look, Saul is dead,' thinking they were bringing me good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag as a reward for his news.
10:4:11/How much more, when wicked men have murdered an innocent man in his own house on his bed, should I not now demand his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth?"
10:4:12/David ordered his men, and they killed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hung them by the pool in Hebron. But they took Ishbosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb in Hebron.
10:5:1/Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your own flesh and blood.
10:5:2/Even when Saul was king, you were the one leading Israel in and out of battle. And the LORD told you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their leader.'"
10:5:3/So all the elders of Israel went to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD. They anointed David king over Israel.
10:5:4/David was thirty years old when he started his reign, and he ruled for forty years.
10:5:5/In Hebron, he ruled over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, he ruled for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
10:5:6/Then the king and his men went to Jerusalem to confront the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who told David, "You won't get in here unless you remove the blind and the lame," thinking, "David can't possibly get in here."
10:5:7/But David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the City of David.
10:5:8/And David declared that day, "Anyone who strikes the Jebusites, including the lame and the blind, whom David despises, will become the leader and commander." That's why they say, "The blind and the lame shall not enter the house."
10:5:9/So David settled in the fortress and named it the City of David. He also built up the area around it, from the supporting terraces inward.
10:5:10/And David continued to grow more powerful, because the LORD God of hosts was with him.
10:5:11/King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar trees, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built David a palace.
10:5:12/And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
10:5:13/David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
10:5:14/These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
10:5:15/Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia,
10:5:16/Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
10:5:17/But when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all came up to search for David. David heard about it and went down to his stronghold.
10:5:18/The Philistines also spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
10:5:19/And David asked the LORD, "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD replied to David, "Go up, for I will certainly hand the Philistines over to you."
10:5:20/So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a flood." Therefore, he named that place Baal Perazim.
10:5:21/There they abandoned their idols, and David and his men carried them away.
10:5:22/Once again, the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
10:5:23/When David inquired of the LORD, He said, "Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
10:5:24/And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because that will mean the LORD has gone out in front of you to strike down the Philistine army."
10:5:25/And David did as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.
10:6:1/Once again, David gathered all the elite men of Israel, thirty thousand in total.
10:6:2/David set out with all his followers from Baale of Judah to transport the ark of God, which is named after the LORD of hosts who resides between the cherubim.
10:6:3/They placed the ark of God on a new cart and moved it from the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, with Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, guiding the new cart.
10:6:4/They transported it from Abinadab's house in Gibeah, with Ahio leading the way in front of the ark of God.
10:6:5/David and all of Israel celebrated before the LORD with all kinds of fir wood instruments, including harps, lyres, tambourines, trumpets, and cymbals.
10:6:6/When they reached Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah reached out to steady the ark of God because the oxen stumbled.
10:6:7/The LORD's anger flared up against Uzzah, and God struck him down there for his mistake, and he died next to the ark of God.
10:6:8/David was upset because the LORD had struck Uzzah, and he named that place Perezuzzah, which it is still called today.
10:6:9/David became fearful of the LORD that day and wondered, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?"
10:6:10/So David decided not to bring the ark of the LORD to the City of David but instead diverted it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
10:6:11/The ark of the LORD stayed in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and his entire household.
10:6:12/When King David heard that the LORD had blessed Obed-edom's household and everything he had because of the ark of God, he joyfully went and brought the ark of God from Obed-edom's house to the City of David.
10:6:13/After those carrying the ark of the LORD had walked six steps, David sacrificed oxen and fattened animals.
10:6:14/David danced with all his might before the LORD, wearing a linen ephod.
10:6:15/Thus, David and all the people of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts of joy and the sound of trumpets.
10:6:16/As the ark of the LORD entered the City of David, Michal, daughter of Saul, watched from a window. Seeing King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she felt contempt for him in her heart.
10:6:17/They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
10:6:18/After David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
10:6:19/He distributed to everyone in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a raisin cake. Then all the people went home.
10:6:20/Then David returned home to bless his family. Michal, daughter of Saul, came out to meet David and sarcastically said, "How distinguished the king of Israel looked today, exposing himself before the servant girls like any vulgar person might do!"
10:6:21/David replied to Michal, "I was celebrating before the LORD, who chose me over your father and his entire family to rule over the LORD's people, Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD.
10:6:22/I will humble myself even more than this and will be lowly in my own eyes. But by the servant girls you mentioned, I will be held in honor."
10:6:23/Therefore, Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children until the day of her death.
10:7:1/When the king was settled in his palace, and the LORD had given him peace from all his enemies around him,
10:7:2/the king said to Nathan the prophet, "Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God resides in a tent."
10:7:3/Nathan replied to the king, "Go ahead and do all that is on your mind, for the LORD is with you."
10:7:4/That night, the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
10:7:5/"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
10:7:6/I have not lived in a house since I brought the Israelites up from Egypt to this day. Instead, I have moved from one tent and dwelling place to another.
10:7:7/Throughout all my travels with all the Israelites, did I ever ask any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'
10:7:8/Now, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.
10:7:9/I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth.
10:7:10/And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
10:7:11/and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you:
10:7:12/When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom.
10:7:13/He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
10:7:14/I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands.
10:7:15/But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
10:7:16/Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.'"
10:7:17/According to all these words and this entire vision, Nathan spoke to David.
10:7:18/Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, "Who am I, Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
10:7:19/And as if this were not enough in your sight, Sovereign LORD, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant—and this decree, Sovereign LORD, is for a mere human!
10:7:20/What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Sovereign LORD.
10:7:21/For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and revealed it to your servant.
10:7:22/"How great you are, Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
10:7:23/And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
10:7:24/You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, LORD, have become their God.
10:7:25/And now, LORD God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you have promised,
10:7:26/so that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, 'The LORD Almighty is God over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established in your presence.
10:7:27/You, LORD Almighty, God of Israel, have revealed this to your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore, your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
10:7:28/Now, Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your covenant is trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.
10:7:29/Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, Sovereign LORD, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.
10:8:1/After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, taking Methegammah from the Philistines.
10:8:2/He also defeated Moab, measuring them with a line to decide their fate; some were put to death, and others were spared. The Moabites became David's subjects and paid tribute.
10:8:3/David also struck down Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he tried to extend his territory to the Euphrates River.
10:8:4/David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David crippled all the chariot horses but kept enough for a hundred chariots.
10:8:5/When the Syrians from Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of them.
10:8:6/David then placed military outposts in Syrian Damascus, and the Syrians became David's subjects, bringing tribute. The LORD protected David wherever he went.
10:8:7/David seized the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
10:8:8/From Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, David took a great amount of bronze.
10:8:9/When Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
10:8:10/Toi sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him for defeating Hadadezer, since Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him silver, gold, and bronze vessels.
10:8:11/King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had taken from all the nations he had subdued;
10:8:12/From Syria, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoils of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
10:8:13/David became renowned after he returned from defeating the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, eighteen thousand men.
10:8:14/He placed military outposts throughout Edom, and all of Edom became subjects of David. The LORD protected David wherever he went.
10:8:15/David ruled over all Israel, administering justice and fairness to all his people.
10:8:16/Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was in charge of the army; Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;
10:8:17/Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the secretary;
10:8:18/Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were key advisors.
10:9:1/And David said, Is there anyone left from Saul's family, so I can show them kindness for Jonathan's sake?
10:9:2/There was a servant from Saul's household named Ziba. When they brought him to David, the king asked, "Are you Ziba?" He replied, "I am your servant."
10:9:3/The king asked, "Isn't there anyone left from Saul's family to whom I can show God's kindness?" Ziba answered the king, "Jonathan has a son who is disabled in both feet."
10:9:4/The king asked, "Where is he?" Ziba told the king, "He's in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lodebar."
10:9:5/Then King David sent for him from the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
10:9:6/When Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, arrived before David, he bowed deeply in respect. David called out, "Mephibosheth!" He responded, "At your service!"
10:9:7/David said to him, "Don't be afraid. I will definitely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you will always eat at my table."
10:9:8/He bowed down and said, "Why do you pay attention to someone as insignificant as I am?"
10:9:9/Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family."
10:9:10/"You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land for him, and you will bring in the harvests to provide food for your master's grandson. But Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, will always eat at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
10:9:11/Ziba said to the king, "I will do everything my lord the king commands his servant." The king declared, "Mephibosheth will eat at my table like one of the king's sons."
10:9:12/And Mephibosheth had a young son named Micha. Everyone in Ziba's household became servants to Mephibosheth.
10:9:13/So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table, even though he was disabled in both feet.
10:10:1/After this event, the king of the Ammonites passed away, and his son Hanun took over as king.
10:10:2/David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun, son of Nahash, just as his father was kind to me." So, David sent his servants to comfort him over his father's death. When David's servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
10:10:3/the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, "Do you really think David is honoring your father by sending these comforters? Isn't it more likely that he's sent them to scout out the city, spy on us, and plan its destruction?"
10:10:4/So, Hanun took David's servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut their clothes up to their buttocks, and sent them away humiliated.
10:10:5/When David heard about this, he sent messengers to meet the men because they were deeply embarrassed. He told them, "Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, then you can return."
10:10:6/Seeing they had made themselves odious to David, the Ammonites hired 20,000 Syrian foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zoba, 1,000 from king Maacah, and 12,000 from Ishtob.
10:10:7/Upon hearing this, David dispatched Joab with all his mighty warriors.
10:10:8/The Ammonites positioned themselves for battle at the city gate, while the hired Syrian forces from Zoba, Rehob, Ishtob, and Maacah took a stand in the open field.
10:10:9/When Joab saw that he was facing enemies both in front and behind, he selected the best troops of Israel to face the Syrians.
10:10:10/He placed the rest of his forces under the command of his brother Abishai, positioning them against the Ammonites.
10:10:11/He said, "If the Syrians prove too strong for me, you must come to my aid; if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll help you."
10:10:12/"Be strong, and let's fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight."
10:10:13/Joab and his troops advanced to battle the Syrians, who fled before them.
10:10:14/When the Ammonites saw the Syrians fleeing, they too fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem.
10:10:15/After their defeat, the Syrians regrouped.
10:10:16/Hadarezer sent for more Syrians from beyond the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam, led by Shobach, the commander of Hadarezer's army.
10:10:17/When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. The Syrians prepared for battle against David and engaged him.
10:10:18/The Syrians fled from Israel. David killed 700 of their charioteers and 40,000 horsemen, and struck down Shobach, the commander of their army, who died there.
10:10:19/When the vassal kings of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their subjects. Thus, the Syrians were afraid to assist the Ammonites anymore.
10:11:1/After a year had passed, during the season when kings typically go to war, David sent Joab, his servants, and all Israel to destroy the Ammonites and besiege Rabbah. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem.
10:11:2/One evening, David got up from his bed and walked around on the palace roof. From there, he saw a woman bathing, and she was very beautiful.
10:11:3/David sent someone to find out about the woman. The person reported, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10:11:4/David sent messengers to bring her to him. She came to him, and he slept with her. She had just purified herself from her menstrual uncleanness. Then she went back home.
10:11:5/The woman became pregnant and sent word to David, saying, "I am pregnant."
10:11:6/David then sent a message to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David.
10:11:7/When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab was doing, how the troops were, and how the war was progressing.
10:11:8/David told Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
10:11:9/But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house.
10:11:10/When David was told, "Uriah did not go home," he asked Uriah, "Haven't you just come from a military campaign? Why didn't you go home?"
10:11:11/Uriah said to David, "The Ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my commander Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open country. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love to my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!"
10:11:12/Then David said to Uriah, "Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
10:11:13/David invited him, and he ate and drank with him; David got him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home.
10:11:14/In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
10:11:15/In the letter he wrote, "Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die."
10:11:16/So when Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.
10:11:17/When the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, some of the men in David's army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.
10:11:18/Then Joab sent and reported to David all the details of the battle.
10:11:19/He instructed the messenger: "When you have finished giving the king all the details of the battle,
10:11:20/if the king's anger rises and he asks you, 'Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?
10:11:21/Who killed Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Didn't a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?' then you are to say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.'"
10:11:22/The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.
10:11:23/The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
10:11:24/Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead."
10:11:25/David said to the messenger, "Tell Joab, 'Don't let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.' Encourage him."
10:11:26/When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him.
10:11:27/After the mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done displeased the LORD.
10:12:1/And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said, "In a certain city, there were two men: one was very rich and the other very poor.
10:12:2/The rich man had a vast number of sheep and cattle:
10:12:3/But the poor man had nothing except one small female lamb he had bought and raised. It grew up with him and his children, sharing his food, drinking from his cup, and sleeping in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
10:12:4/When a traveler came to the rich man, he didn't want to use one of his own animals to prepare a meal for the visitor. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and cooked it for his guest.
10:12:5/David was furious with the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
10:12:6/He must pay back the lamb four times over because he did such a thing and had no compassion."
10:12:7/Then Nathan said to David, "You are that man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from Saul.
10:12:8/I gave you your master's house and wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I would have given you even more.
10:12:9/Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and took his wife to be your own.
10:12:10/Therefore, the sword will never leave your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'
10:12:11/This is what the LORD says: 'I will bring calamity on you from within your own family. I will take your wives and give them to someone close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight.
10:12:12/You did it secretly, but I will do this in broad daylight before all Israel.'"
10:12:13/Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.
10:12:14/However, because by this action you have shown utter contempt for the LORD, the child born to you will die."
10:12:15/Then Nathan went back to his home. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and it became ill.
10:12:16/David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth on the ground.
10:12:17/The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.
10:12:18/On the seventh day, the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. They thought, "While the child was still alive, we spoke to David, and he wouldn't listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate."
10:12:19/When David noticed his servants whispering, he realized the child was dead and asked, "Is the child dead?" They replied, "He is dead."
10:12:20/Then David got up from the ground, washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes, went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request, they served him food, and he ate.
10:12:21/His servants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat."
10:12:22/He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.'
10:12:23/But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."
10:12:24/Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The LORD loved him
10:12:25/and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
10:12:26/Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.
10:12:27/Joab sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply.
10:12:28/Now muster the rest of the troops, besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise, I will take the city, and it will be named after me."
10:12:29/So David mustered all the people, went to Rabbah, fought against it, and captured it.
10:12:30/He took the crown from their king's head, and it was placed on David's own head. The crown was made of gold and set with precious stones, and it was very heavy. David took a great quantity of plunder from the city.
10:12:31/He also brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, or made them work at the brick kilns. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
10:13:1/After this, Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and Amnon, another of David's sons, fell in love with her.
10:13:2/Amnon became so obsessed that he made himself sick over his sister Tamar, because she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.
10:13:3/But Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, who was very cunning.
10:13:4/He asked him, "Why are you, the king's son, looking so haggard day after day? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
10:13:5/Jonadab then said to him, "Pretend to be ill and lie down. When your father comes to see you, ask him to have Tamar come and prepare some food for you, so you can watch her make it and then eat it from her hand."
10:13:6/So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon asked the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my presence, so I can eat from her hand."
10:13:7/Then David sent a message to Tamar at home, saying, "Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare some food for him."
10:13:8/So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his presence, and baked them.
10:13:9/She took the pan and served him the cakes, but he refused to eat. Amnon said, "Have everyone leave me." So everyone left him.
10:13:10/Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the bedroom, so I may eat from your hand." Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them to Amnon, her brother, in the bedroom.
10:13:11/But when she brought them to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come sleep with me, my sister."
10:13:12/She replied, "No, my brother, don't force me; such things should not be done in Israel. Don't do this disgraceful thing.
10:13:13/Where could I take my shame? And you would be like one of the scoundrels in Israel. Please, speak to the king; he won't deny me to you."
10:13:14/However, he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he forced her and slept with her.
10:13:15/Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, his hatred for her was greater than the love he had felt for her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and leave."
10:13:16/She said to him, "Sending me away is a greater wrong than what you've already done to me." But he refused to listen to her.
10:13:17/He called his servant and said, "Get this woman out of my sight and lock the door behind her."
10:13:18/She was wearing a richly colored garment, for this was how virgin daughters of the king were dressed. His servant put her out and locked the door behind her.
10:13:19/Tamar put ashes on her head, tore the colored garment she was wearing, placed her hand on her head, and walked away, weeping aloud as she went.
10:13:20/Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this to heart." So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.
10:13:21/When King David heard about all these things, he was furious.
10:13:22/Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad, because he hated Amnon for having violated his sister Tamar.
10:13:23/Two years later, when Absalom had sheep shearers at Baal Hazor near Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons.
10:13:24/Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has sheep shearers; please let the king and his servants join your servant."
10:13:25/The king replied to Absalom, "No, my son, we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave him his blessing.
10:13:26/Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"
10:13:27/But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
10:13:28/Absalom ordered his men, "Watch Amnon's actions. When he is cheerful with wine, and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid; haven't I given you this order? Be strong and brave."
10:13:29/So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules, and fled.
10:13:30/While they were on their way, news came to David: "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left."
10:13:31/The king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay on the ground; all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
10:13:32/Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "My lord should not think that all the young men, the king's sons, are dead; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's intention since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar.
10:13:33/So let not my lord the king take this matter to heart, thinking all his sons are dead; only Amnon is dead."
10:13:34/But Absalom fled. And the lookout raised his eyes and looked, and there were many people coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.
10:13:35/Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has happened."
10:13:36/As soon as he finished speaking, the king's sons arrived, weeping loudly. The king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.
10:13:37/But Absalom fled and went to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
10:13:38/So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and stayed there three years.
10:13:39/And King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was consoled regarding Amnon, since he was dead.
10:14:1/Joab, the son of Zeruiah, noticed that the king's heart was inclined towards Absalom.
10:14:2/Joab sent to Tekoah, brought back a wise woman, and told her, "Please pretend to be a mourner, wear mourning clothes, don't use any perfume, and act like you've been mourning a death for a long time."
10:14:3/"Then go to the king and say these words to him." Joab gave her a script to follow.
10:14:4/When the woman from Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell to the ground in respect, and said, "Help, O king."
10:14:5/The king asked her, "What's wrong?" She replied, "I am a widow, and my husband has passed away."
10:14:6/"I had two sons who fought in the field with no one to separate them, and one killed the other."
10:14:7/"Now, the whole family is against me, demanding I hand over the son who killed his brother so they can execute him. This would leave me with neither heir nor name, erasing my husband's legacy from the earth."
10:14:8/The king told the woman, "Go home, and I will take care of this matter for you."
10:14:9/The woman from Tekoah said to the king, "My lord, O king, let the blame be on me and my family, and let the king and his throne be innocent."
10:14:10/The king said, "If anyone says anything to you, bring them to me, and they won't bother you again."
10:14:11/She said, "Please, remember the LORD your God and prevent the avengers of blood from causing further destruction, so they don't kill my son." He replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of your son's head will fall to the ground."
10:14:12/Then the woman said, "Please allow me, your servant, to speak another word to my lord the king." He said, "Go ahead."
10:14:13/And the woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against God's people? For in saying this, the king implicates himself by not bringing back his own exiled son."
10:14:14/"We all must die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be collected again. Yet, God does not take away life but plans ways so that the estranged may not remain estranged from Him."
10:14:15/"I have come to speak to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. I thought, 'Let me speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant's request.'"
10:14:16/"For the king listens and can save his servant from the hand of the man seeking to eliminate both me and my son from God's inheritance."
10:14:17/"Your servant thought, 'The words of my lord the king will bring comfort.' For like an angel of God, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you."
10:14:18/Then the king responded, "Please don't hide anything from me that I'm about to ask you." The woman said, "Let my lord the king speak."
10:14:19/The king asked, "Is Joab involved in all this?" The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can deviate from anything my lord the king has said. Yes, your servant Joab directed me, and he put all these words in my mouth."
10:14:20/"To change the course of this matter, your servant Joab did this. And my lord is wise, like the wisdom of an angel of God, knowing everything that happens in the land."
10:14:21/And the king said to Joab, "Alright, I've decided: go and bring back the young man Absalom."
10:14:22/Joab fell to the ground in respect, bowed, and thanked the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, O king, because the king has fulfilled his servant's request."
10:14:23/So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
10:14:24/The king said, "Let him return to his own house, but he must not see my face." So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the king's face.
10:14:25/But in all Israel, there was no one as praised for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no flaw in him.
10:14:26/When he cut his hair (which he did at the end of every year because it became too heavy), the hair weighed two hundred shekels by the royal standard.
10:14:27/Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman.
10:14:28/Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two full years without seeing the king's face.
10:14:29/Therefore, Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come. When he sent a second time, Joab still wouldn't come.
10:14:30/So he said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
10:14:31/Then Joab got up, went to Absalom's house, and asked, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
10:14:32/Absalom answered Joab, "Look, I sent for you, asking you to come here so I could send you to the king to ask, 'Why have I come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to stay there. Now let me see the king's face; and if there is any guilt in me, let him execute me.'"
10:14:33/So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then he called for Absalom, who came to the king and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
10:15:1/After this, Absalom got himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him.
10:15:2/Absalom would get up early and stand by the road near the gate. Whenever someone with a legal issue came to the king for a decision, Absalom would call them over and ask, "Which city are you from?" And they would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
10:15:3/Absalom would say to them, "Look, your case is valid and fair, but there's no representative from the king to hear you out."
10:15:4/Absalom also said, "I wish I were appointed judge in the land, so that anyone with a dispute or case could come to me, and I would ensure they receive justice."
10:15:5/Whenever someone approached him to bow down, he would reach out his hand, grab them, and kiss them.
10:15:6/This is how Absalom treated all the Israelites who came to the king for justice, and so he won the hearts of the people of Israel.
10:15:7/After forty years, Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I made to the LORD."
10:15:8/"While I was staying at Geshur in Syria, I made a vow saying, 'If the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem, I will serve the LORD.'"
10:15:9/The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he got up and went to Hebron.
10:15:10/But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'"
10:15:11/Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They had been invited and went innocently, knowing nothing of the matter.
10:15:12/Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for more and more people sided with Absalom.
10:15:13/A messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom."
10:15:14/David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "We must flee, or we won't escape from Absalom. Hurry, or he will quickly overtake us, bring disaster upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
10:15:15/The king's officials said to the king, "We are ready to do whatever our lord the king decides."
10:15:16/The king set out, with his entire household following him, but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace.
10:15:17/The king set out, with all the people following him, and they stopped at a place some distance away.
10:15:18/All his servants marched past him, along with all the Cherethites, Pelethites, and Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, marching before the king.
10:15:19/Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why are you also coming with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home."
10:15:20/"You only arrived yesterday, so why should I make you wander around with us today, when I don't know where I'm going? Go back and take your people with you. May kindness and faithfulness be with you."
10:15:21/But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there your servant will be."
10:15:22/David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, cross over." So Ittai the Gittite crossed over, along with all his men and all the children who were with him.
10:15:23/The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king himself crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.
10:15:24/Zadok was there too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished passing out of the city.
10:15:25/Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again."
10:15:26/"But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him."
10:15:27/The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
10:15:28/"I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
10:15:29/So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
10:15:30/David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up.
10:15:31/Someone told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David prayed, "O LORD, please turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."
10:15:32/When David reached the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dirt on his head.
10:15:33/David said to him, "If you come with me, you'll be a burden to me."
10:15:34/"But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I was your father's servant in the past, so I will now be your servant,' then you can help me by countering Ahithophel's advice."
10:15:35/"Aren't Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
10:15:36/"Look, their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son, are there with them. Send me everything you hear through them."
10:15:37/So Hushai, David's friend, entered the city as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
10:16:1/As David was just beyond the hilltop, Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, met him with two saddled donkeys, carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
10:16:2/The king asked Ziba, "What's the meaning of these?" Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride; the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat; and the wine is for those who are exhausted in the desert to drink."
10:16:3/The king then asked, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba answered the king, "He's staying in Jerusalem, saying, 'Today, the house of Israel will return my father's kingdom to me.'"
10:16:4/Then the king told Ziba, "Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." Ziba responded, "I deeply appreciate this, my lord, O king. May I always find favor in your eyes."
10:16:5/When King David arrived at Bahurim, a man from Saul's family lineage named Shimei, son of Gera, came out. He started cursing as he approached.
10:16:6/He threw stones at David and all of King David's servants, while all the people and warriors were on his right and left.
10:16:7/As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel!
10:16:8/"The LORD is repaying you for all the bloodshed in Saul's family, whom you replaced as king. The LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. See, your own evil has caught up with you because you are a murderer."
10:16:9/Then Abishai, son of Zeruiah, said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and cut off his head."
10:16:10/But the king said, "What is this to me and you, sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD told him to curse David, who can ask, 'Why are you doing this?'"
10:16:11/David then said to Abishai and all his servants, "Look, my own son is trying to take my life. How much more this Benjaminite? Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
10:16:12/"Perhaps the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for his cursing today."
10:16:13/As David and his men continued along the road, Shimei kept pace with them on the hillside opposite, cursing as he went, throwing stones and kicking up dust.
10:16:14/The king and all the people with him arrived exhausted, but they refreshed themselves there.
10:16:15/Absalom and all the men of Israel reached Jerusalem, along with Ahithophel.
10:16:16/When Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
10:16:17/Absalom asked Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?"
10:16:18/Hushai replied to Absalom, "No; I will be loyal to the one the LORD, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen. I will stay with him.
10:16:19/"Besides, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so I will be in yours."
10:16:20/Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice on what we should do."
10:16:21/Ahithophel told Absalom, "Sleep with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened."
10:16:22/So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom slept with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
10:16:23/The advice Ahithophel gave in those days was as if one had inquired of the oracle of God. Such was the reputation of all Ahithophel's advice, both with David and with Absalom.
10:17:1/Moreover, Ahithophel suggested to Absalom, "Let me select twelve thousand men, and I will set out to chase David tonight.
10:17:2/I will catch him while he is tired and weak, causing him to panic. All the people with him will run away, and I will only strike down the king.
10:17:3/Then I will bring all the people back to you. The man you're after will be as good as captured, and everyone will be at peace."
10:17:4/This plan pleased Absalom and all the leaders of Israel.
10:17:5/Then Absalom said, "Call Hushai the Archite as well, and let's hear what he has to say."
10:17:6/When Hushai arrived, Absalom told him what Ahithophel had proposed and asked, "Should we follow his advice? If not, what do you suggest?"
10:17:7/Hushai told Absalom, "Ahithophel's advice isn't the best course of action right now."
10:17:8/Hushai explained, "You know your father and his men are fierce warriors, agitated and dangerous like a mother bear robbed of her cubs. Your father is a seasoned warrior; he won't be with the troops.
10:17:9/He's probably hiding in a pit or somewhere else right now. If some of his men are killed early on, anyone hearing about it will think there's a massacre among Absalom's followers.
10:17:10/Even the bravest, with the heart of a lion, will be demoralized. Everyone in Israel knows your father is a formidable man, and those with him are courageous.
10:17:11/So, I suggest gathering all of Israel to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as numerous as the sand by the sea, and lead them yourself into battle.
10:17:12/That way, we can attack him wherever he is found, and fall on him like dew covers the ground. Not one of him or his men will survive.
10:17:13/And if he retreats into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we'll drag it into the river until not even a pebble is left."
10:17:14/Absalom and all the men of Israel concluded that Hushai the Archite's advice was better than Ahithophel's. The LORD had determined to undermine Ahithophel's sound advice, intending to bring disaster upon Absalom.
10:17:15/Then Hushai told priests Zadok and Abiathar, "Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel this way, but I have advised them this way.
10:17:16/Now, send a message quickly to David, warning him not to stay tonight in the wilderness plains but to cross over immediately, to prevent him and all his people from being annihilated."
10:17:17/Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed near Enrogel, as they couldn't risk being seen entering the city. A servant girl went to inform them, and they went to tell King David.
10:17:18/However, a young boy saw them and informed Absalom. But they quickly escaped to a house in Bahurim, which had a well in its courtyard where they hid.
10:17:19/The woman of the house covered the well's mouth with a cloth and scattered grain over it, so nothing seemed amiss.
10:17:20/When Absalom's servants arrived at the house and asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman lied, saying, "They crossed the brook." After searching and finding no trace of them, the servants returned to Jerusalem.
10:17:21/After the servants left, the two men climbed out of the well and went to inform King David, urging him, "Hurry and cross the water, because Ahithophel has advised against you."
10:17:22/David and all his followers then crossed the Jordan River. By dawn, not one was left who hadn't crossed.
10:17:23/When Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled his donkey, went home to his city, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. He died and was buried in his family's tomb.
10:17:24/David reached Mahanaim, while Absalom and all the men of Israel crossed the Jordan River with him.
10:17:25/Absalom appointed Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Israelite, who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
10:17:26/So Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
10:17:27/When David arrived in Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
10:17:28/brought bedding, bowls, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, and roasted seeds,
10:17:29/along with honey, butter, sheep, and cheese from cows, for David and his people to eat. They said, "The people are hungry, tired, and thirsty in the desert."
10:18:1/David took a census of the people with him, appointing leaders of thousands and hundreds over them.
10:18:2/David divided the troops into three groups: one under Joab's command, another under Abishai, Joab’s brother, and the last under Ittai the Gittite. David assured the people, "I will definitely join you in battle."
10:18:3/But the people insisted, "You must not go! If we have to retreat, they won't care about us; even if half of us die, it won't matter to them. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It's better for you to support us from the city."
10:18:4/David agreed, "I'll do what you think is best." He stood by the gate while the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and thousands.
10:18:5/David ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "For my sake, be gentle with the young man Absalom." Everyone heard the king's orders regarding Absalom.
10:18:6/The troops went out to battle against Israel in the forest of Ephraim.
10:18:7/The Israelite forces were defeated by David's servants, resulting in a massive loss of twenty thousand men that day.
10:18:8/The battle spread across the countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.
10:18:9/Absalom encountered David's men while riding a mule. The mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, and Absalom's head got caught in the oak, leaving him hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule ran off.
10:18:10/When a man saw this, he reported to Joab, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."
10:18:11/Joab asked the man, "You saw him? Why didn't you strike him down right there? I would have rewarded you with ten shekels of silver and a belt."
10:18:12/The man replied to Joab, "Even if you offered me a thousand shekels of silver, I wouldn't lay a hand on the king's son. We all heard the king instruct you, Abishai, and Ittai to protect Absalom for his sake."
10:18:13/"If I had acted against his life, I would have been endangering my own, since nothing is hidden from the king. You would have opposed me."
10:18:14/Joab said, "I can't waste time with you." He grabbed three darts and thrust them into Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the oak.
10:18:15/Ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him.
10:18:16/Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, as Joab restrained them.
10:18:17/They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.
10:18:18/While he was alive, Absalom had erected a monument for himself in the King's Valley, saying, "I have no son to keep my name alive." He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom's Monument to this day.
10:18:19/Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, said, "Let me run and bring the king the news that the LORD has vindicated him by defeating his enemies."
10:18:20/Joab told him, "You will not carry the news today. You can do so another day, but today you will not, because the king's son is dead."
10:18:21/Joab then said to Cushi, "Go, inform the king of what you have seen." Cushi bowed to Joab and ran off.
10:18:22/Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, again pleaded with Joab, "Whatever happens, please let me also run after Cushi." Joab asked, "Why do you want to run, my son, when you have no message?"
10:18:23/"Regardless," he said, "I want to run." So Joab told him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by the plain and outran Cushi.
10:18:24/David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gate and saw a man running alone.
10:18:25/The watchman shouted down to inform the king, who said, "If he is alone, he brings news." The runner approached quickly.
10:18:26/Then the watchman saw another man running and called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He also brings news."
10:18:27/The watchman said, "The first runner runs like Ahimaaz, son of Zadok." The king remarked, "He's a good man and comes with good news."
10:18:28/Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delivered up those who raised their hands against my lord the king."
10:18:29/The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz replied, "I saw a great commotion when Joab sent the king's servant and me, but I didn't know what it was."
10:18:30/The king told him, "Step aside and stand here." He stepped aside and waited.
10:18:31/Then Cushi arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has avenged you today against all who rebelled against you."
10:18:32/The king asked Cushi, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Cushi replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise against you to harm you be like that young man."
10:18:33/Deeply moved, the king went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. As he went, he cried, "Oh my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, oh Absalom, my son, my son!"
10:19:1/Joab was informed, "Look, the king is crying and mourning for Absalom."
10:19:2/And the joy of victory that day turned into sorrow for all the people, as they heard how deeply the king was grieving for his son.
10:19:3/The people sneaked back into the city that day, like those ashamed sneak away when they flee in battle.
10:19:4/But the king covered his face and cried out loudly, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10:19:5/Joab entered the king's house and said, "Today, you have embarrassed all your servants who saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives, and your concubines;
10:19:6/Because you show love to your enemies and hate towards your friends. You've made it clear today that you care neither for your leaders nor your servants. Today, I see that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died, that would have been preferable to you."
10:19:7/"Now, get up, go out, and reassure your servants. I swear by the LORD, if you don't go out, not one person will stay with you tonight. And that will be worse for you than all the troubles you've faced from your youth until now."
10:19:8/Then the king got up and sat at the city gate. And it was announced to all the people, "Look, the king is sitting at the gate." And all the people came before the king. Meanwhile, Israel had scattered, each to his own home.
10:19:9/And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing, saying, "The king saved us from our enemies and delivered us from the Philistines, but now he has fled the land because of Absalom."
10:19:10/"And Absalom, whom we anointed as our leader, is dead in battle. So why are we not saying anything about bringing the king back?"
10:19:11/King David sent messages to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, saying, "Talk to the elders of Judah and ask them, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, when the call to do so has reached all Israel and his household?'"
10:19:12/"You are my kin, my own flesh and blood. So why are you the last to bring back the king?"
10:19:13/"And tell Amasa, 'Aren't you my flesh and blood too? May God deal with me, severely if you are not the commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.'"
10:19:14/He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as if they were one man; they sent word to the king, "Return, you and all your servants."
10:19:15/So the king returned and came to the Jordan River. And the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and escort him across the Jordan.
10:19:16/Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
10:19:17/With him were a thousand men from Benjamin, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan before the king.
10:19:18/A ferry boat went across to carry the king's household and do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell before the king
10:19:19/And said to the king, "Let my lord not hold me guilty, nor remember the wrong your servant did on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Please, let the king put it out of his mind.
10:19:20/For I, your servant, know I have sinned. But today, I am the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."
10:19:21/But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this, since he cursed the LORD's anointed?"
10:19:22/David replied, "What is it to me, you sons of Zeruiah, that you become a nuisance today? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don't I know that today I am king over Israel?"
10:19:23/Therefore, the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king swore an oath to him.
10:19:24/Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, came down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet, trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.
10:19:25/When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you come with me, Mephibosheth?"
10:19:26/He replied, "My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. I said, 'I will saddle my donkey so I can ride on it and go with the king,' because I am lame.
10:19:27/But he slandered your servant to my lord the king. However, my lord the king is like an angel of God. So do what seems best to you.
10:19:28/All my father's household deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you placed your servant among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?"
10:19:29/The king said to him, "Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba divide the land."
10:19:30/Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned safely to his own home."
10:19:31/Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and crossed the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan.
10:19:32/Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
10:19:33/The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem."
10:19:34/But Barzillai answered the king, "How many more years will I live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
10:19:35/I am eighty years old today. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
10:19:36/Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me with such a favor?
10:19:37/Please let your servant return, so I may die in my own city near the graves of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what you think is best."
10:19:38/The king answered, "Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems best to you. And anything you request of me, I will do for you."
10:19:39/So all the people crossed the Jordan, and the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home.
10:19:40/Then the king continued to Gilgal, with Chimham accompanying him. All the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel escorted the king.
10:19:41/Then all the men of Israel came to the king and asked, "Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, secretly taken you away, along with your household and all David's men, across the Jordan?"
10:19:42/The men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, "Because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about this? Have we eaten at the king's expense, or has he given us any gifts?"
10:19:43/But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king, and we have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt? Weren't we the first to suggest bringing back our king?" Yet the arguments of the men of Judah were more forceful than those of the men of Israel.
10:20:1/There was a troublemaker named Sheba, son of Bichri, from the tribe of Benjamin. He blew a trumpet and declared, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son! Everyone back to their tents, O Israel!"
10:20:2/So all the men of Israel abandoned David and followed Sheba, son of Bichri. But the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem.
10:20:3/When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to care for the palace and placed them under house arrest. He provided for them, but did not visit them. They lived in isolation until they died, as if they were widows.
10:20:4/David then ordered Amasa, "Gather the men of Judah within three days, and make sure you are here too."
10:20:5/Amasa went to summon the men of Judah, but he took longer than the time David had set for him.
10:20:6/David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba, son of Bichri, will cause us more trouble than Absalom did. Take my men and chase after him before he finds fortified cities and escapes from us."
10:20:7/So Joab's men, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors, left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, son of Bichri.
10:20:8/When they were near the large rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military garment with a belt that had a sword in its sheath. As he stepped forward, the sword fell out.
10:20:9/Joab greeted Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" And he grabbed Amasa's beard with his right hand as if to kiss him.
10:20:10/But Amasa didn't notice the sword in Joab's hand. Joab struck him with it in the stomach, spilling his intestines on the ground, and he didn't strike him again. Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued the pursuit of Sheba, son of Bichri.
10:20:11/One of Joab's men stood by Amasa's body and called out, "Whoever supports Joab and David, follow Joab!"
10:20:12/Amasa lay in his blood in the middle of the road. When the man saw that everyone was stopping to look, he dragged Amasa off the road into a field and covered him with a cloth.
10:20:13/Once Amasa was moved from the road, everyone followed Joab to chase after Sheba, son of Bichri.
10:20:14/They went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, Beth Maacah, and all the Berites. They gathered together and followed Joab.
10:20:15/They arrived and laid siege to Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, which stood against the outer wall. All the troops with Joab battered the wall to bring it down.
10:20:16/Then a wise woman called from the city, "Listen, listen! Please tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him."
10:20:17/When Joab approached, the woman asked, "Are you Joab?" He replied, "I am." Then she said, "Listen to what your servant has to say." He answered, "I'm listening."
10:20:18/She said, "In the past, people would say, 'Let them ask for advice in Abel,' and that's how disputes were settled.
10:20:19/I am one of the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to destroy the LORD's inheritance?"
10:20:20/Joab responded, "Far from it, far from it for me to swallow up or destroy!
10:20:21/That's not the case. A man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba son of Bichri, has rebelled against King David. Hand him over, and I'll withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you over the wall."
10:20:22/Then the woman went to all the people with her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab. He then blew the trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, each to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
10:20:23/Joab was in command of all the army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites;
10:20:24/Adoram was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
10:20:25/Sheva was the secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
10:20:26/And Ira the Jairite was David's chief advisor.
10:21:1/Then there was a famine during David's reign for three consecutive years; David sought the LORD's guidance. The LORD revealed it was due to Saul and his violent actions against the Gibeonites.
10:21:2/David summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. The Gibeonites were not Israelites but remnants of the Amorites. Despite Israel's oath to them, Saul had tried to eliminate them in his zeal for Israel and Judah.
10:21:3/So David asked the Gibeonites, "What can I do for you? How can I make amends so you will bless the LORD's inheritance?"
10:21:4/The Gibeonites replied, "We don't want silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we want you to kill anyone in Israel for us." David said, "Tell me what you want me to do for you."
10:21:5/They said, "The man who tried to exterminate us and plotted to wipe us out from staying anywhere in Israel's territory,
10:21:6/let seven of his male descendants be handed over to us, and we will execute them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD." David agreed, "I will give them."
10:21:7/However, David spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, because of the sacred promise between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.
10:21:8/But David took the two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal, daughter of Saul, whom she raised for Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
10:21:9/And handed them over to the Gibeonites, who executed them on a hill before the LORD. All seven died together, executed during the harvest, at the start of the barley harvest.
10:21:10/Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, laid out sackcloth on a rock from the start of the harvest until rain fell from the sky on the bodies, preventing birds from touching them by day or wild animals by night.
10:21:11/When David was told what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done,
10:21:12/David retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the streets of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hung them after defeating Saul in Gilboa.
10:21:13/He brought back the bones of Saul and Jonathan; and they collected the bones of those who had been executed.
10:21:14/The bones of Saul and Jonathan were buried in the land of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father. They carried out all that the king commanded. Afterward, God was appeased for the land.
10:21:15/Additionally, the Philistines waged war against Israel again; David and his men went down to fight the Philistines, and David became exhausted.
10:21:16/Ishbibenob, a descendant of the giants, whose spear weighed 300 shekels of bronze and who was armed with a new sword, aimed to kill David.
10:21:17/But Abishai, son of Zeruiah, came to his rescue, struck down the Philistine, and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, "You must not go to battle with us again, so you don't extinguish the light of Israel."
10:21:18/After this, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob: Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, a descendant of the giants.
10:21:19/There was another battle with the Philistines in Gob, where Elhanan, son of Jaareoregim from Bethlehem, killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear shaft was like a weaver's rod.
10:21:20/And in another battle in Gath, there was a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in total; he too was descended from the giants.
10:21:21/When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him.
10:21:22/These four were descendants of the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and his servants.
10:22:1/And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day the LORD had rescued him from the grasp of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul:
10:22:2/And he said, The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my rescuer;
10:22:3/The God of my rock; in him I will trust: he is my shield, the source of my salvation, my stronghold, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.
10:22:4/I will call on the LORD, who deserves all praise: so I will be saved from my enemies.
10:22:5/When the waves of death surrounded me, the floods of wicked men made me afraid;
10:22:6/The sorrows of hell surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me;
10:22:7/In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried out to my God: and he heard my voice from his temple, and my cry reached his ears.
10:22:8/Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of heaven moved and trembled, because he was angry.
10:22:9/Smoke rose from his nostrils, and consuming fire from his mouth; coals were ignited by it.
10:22:10/He parted the heavens and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
10:22:11/And he rode upon a cherub, and flew: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
10:22:12/And he made darkness his covering, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
10:22:13/Through the brightness before him, coals of fire were ignited.
10:22:14/The LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High voiced his presence.
10:22:15/And he shot out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
10:22:16/And the depths of the sea were revealed, the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
10:22:17/He reached down from on high, he took me; he drew me out of deep waters;
10:22:18/He rescued me from my powerful enemy, and from those who hated me: for they were too strong for me.
10:22:19/They confronted me in the day of my disaster: but the LORD was my support.
10:22:20/He also brought me out into a spacious place: he rescued me because he delighted in me.
10:22:21/The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the purity of my hands he has repaid me.
10:22:22/For I have followed the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
10:22:23/For all his laws were before me: and I did not turn away from his statutes.
10:22:24/I was also blameless before him, and I kept myself from my sin.
10:22:25/Therefore the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness; according to my purity in his eyes.
10:22:26/With the merciful you show yourself merciful, with the blameless man you show yourself blameless.
10:22:27/With the pure you show yourself pure; and with the devious you show yourself shrewd.
10:22:28/And the afflicted people you will save: but your eyes are on the haughty, to bring them down.
10:22:29/For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will illuminate my darkness.
10:22:30/For by you I have charged through a troop: by my God I have leaped over a wall.
10:22:31/As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless: he is a shield to all who trust in him.
10:22:32/For who is God, besides the LORD? and who is a rock, except our God?
10:22:33/God is my strength and power: and he makes my path perfect.
10:22:34/He makes my feet like the feet of a deer: and sets me on my high places.
10:22:35/He trains my hands for battle; so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
10:22:36/You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your gentleness has made me great.
10:22:37/You have broadened my steps beneath me; so that my feet did not slip.
10:22:38/I pursued my enemies and destroyed them; and did not turn back until they were consumed.
10:22:39/And I have consumed them, and wounded them, so they could not rise: yes, they have fallen under my feet.
10:22:40/For you have equipped me with strength for the battle: those who rose up against me you have subdued under me.
10:22:41/You have also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy those who hate me.
10:22:42/They looked, but there was no one to save; even to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
10:22:43/Then I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth, I crushed them and stamped them down like mud in the streets, and spread them out.
10:22:44/You also have delivered me from the conflicts of my people, you have kept me to be the head of nations: a people I had not known shall serve me.
10:22:45/Foreigners shall submit to me: as soon as they hear, they shall obey me.
10:22:46/Foreigners shall lose heart, and come trembling out of their fortresses.
10:22:47/The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
10:22:48/It is God who avenges me, and subdues peoples under me.
10:22:49/And who brings me out from my enemies: you also have lifted me up high above those who rose against me; you have delivered me from the violent man.
10:22:50/Therefore I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the nations, and I will sing praises to your name.
10:22:51/He gives great victories to his king; and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
10:23:1/Now these are the last words of David. David, the son of Jesse, spoke, the man who was elevated, the anointed by the God of Jacob, and Israel's beloved songwriter, said,
10:23:2/The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me, and his word was on my tongue.
10:23:3/The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel said to me: One who rules over people must be just, governing in the fear of God.
10:23:4/And he will be like the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds; like the fresh grass sprouting from the earth after a clear rain.
10:23:5/Even though my family is not perfect in God's eyes; he has established an everlasting covenant with me, organized in every detail and secure. This is all my salvation and all my desire, even though he does not make it flourish.
10:23:6/But the worthless shall be completely like thorns cast away, for they cannot be picked up with the hand.
10:23:7/But anyone who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear; they will be completely burned with fire in their place.
10:23:8/Here are the names of the mighty warriors whom David had: The Tachmonite who sat in the chief seat, among the captains; this was Adino the Eznite, who struck down eight hundred men in one encounter.
10:23:9/Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors with David when they challenged the Philistines gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel had retreated.
10:23:10/He stood up and struck the Philistines until his hand grew tired and stuck to his sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day, and the people returned after him only to collect the plunder.
10:23:11/Next to him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a plot of ground full of lentils, and the troops fled from the Philistines,
10:23:12/He stood in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. And the LORD brought about a great victory.
10:23:13/Three of the thirty chiefs went down to David during the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
10:23:14/At that time, David was in a stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
10:23:15/David longed and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
10:23:16/So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD.
10:23:17/He said, "The LORD forbid that I should do this! Isn't this the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?" So he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty warriors.
10:23:18/Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was the leader of the three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and became famous among the three.
10:23:19/Wasn't he the most honored of the three? Therefore, he became their commander, but he did not attain to the first three.
10:23:20/Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who performed great deeds, he struck down two of Moab's mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
10:23:21/And he killed an impressive Egyptian. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
10:23:22/These were the exploits of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, who earned a name among the three mighty warriors.
10:23:23/He was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
10:23:24/Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
10:23:25/Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
10:23:26/Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
10:23:27/Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
10:23:28/Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
10:23:29/Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
10:23:30/Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,
10:23:31/Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
10:23:32/Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
10:23:33/Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
10:23:34/Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
10:23:35/Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
10:23:36/Igal the son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
10:23:37/Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armor-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
10:23:38/Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
10:23:39/Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
10:24:1/Once again, the LORD's anger flared up against Israel, prompting him to incite David to say, "Go, count Israel and Judah."
10:24:2/The king instructed Joab, the commander of his army, "Travel through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and take a census of the people, so I can know their number."
10:24:3/Joab responded to the king, "May the LORD your God increase the number of the people a hundred times over, and may you live to see it. But why does this please you, my lord the king?"
10:24:4/Despite this, the king's command overruled Joab and the army commanders. So Joab and the commanders left the king's presence to count the people of Israel.
10:24:5/They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, to the south of the city in the middle of the Gad valley, and then moved toward Jazer.
10:24:6/Then they went through Gilead and the region of Tahtimhodshi, passed by Danjaan, and around Sidon,
10:24:7/They reached the fortress of Tyre and visited all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went to the southern part of Judah, to Beersheba.
10:24:8/After traversing the entire land, they returned to Jerusalem nine months and twenty days later.
10:24:9/Joab reported the census results to the king: there were 800,000 valiant warriors in Israel who could wield a sword, and the men of Judah numbered 500,000.
10:24:10/Afterward, David felt remorse for having counted the people and said to the LORD, "I have greatly sinned in what I have done. Now, I beg you, O LORD, to forgive the sin of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."
10:24:11/When David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
10:24:12/"Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three options; choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"
10:24:13/So Gad went to David and told him, "Shall seven years of famine come to your land? Or will you flee for three months before your enemies while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Think it over and decide what answer I should give to the one who sent me."
10:24:14/David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands."
10:24:15/Therefore, the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men from Dan to Beersheba died.
10:24:16/When the angel extended his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was striking down the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then near the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
10:24:17/Seeing the angel who was striking the people, David said to the LORD, "I am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me and my family, not against your people."
10:24:18/That day, Gad came to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10:24:19/David went up as the LORD had commanded through Gad.
10:24:20/When Araunah saw the king and his servants approaching, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
10:24:21/Araunah asked, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David replied, "To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, so the plague may be halted among the people."
10:24:22/Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and yokes of the oxen for wood."
10:24:23/"All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you."
10:24:24/But the king said to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it from you at a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
10:24:25/And David built an altar there to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Thus, the LORD was moved on behalf of the land, and the plague was stopped from afflicting Israel.
11:1:1/Now King David was old and advanced in years; despite being covered with clothes, he could not stay warm.
11:1:2/So his servants suggested, "Let's find a young virgin for my lord the king; she can take care of him and lie close to him so the king may stay warm."
11:1:3/They searched throughout all Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag the Shunammite, bringing her to the king.
11:1:4/The young woman was very beautiful, took care of the king, and served him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.
11:1:5/Then Adonijah, son of Haggith, declared himself king. He acquired chariots, horsemen, and fifty men to run ahead of him.
11:1:6/His father had never questioned his actions, asking, "Why do you behave this way?" He was also very handsome, born after Absalom.
11:1:7/He consulted with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest, who supported Adonijah's claim.
11:1:8/But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's elite warriors did not support Adonijah.
11:1:9/Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle near the stone of Zoheleth by Enrogel, inviting all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.
11:1:10/However, he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the elite warriors, or Solomon his brother.
11:1:11/Therefore, Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David knowing it?
11:1:12/Now let me advise you on how to save your life and the life of your son Solomon.
11:1:13/Go and enter King David's presence, and say to him, 'My lord, O king, did you not promise your servant that Solomon your son would succeed you as king and sit on your throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?'
11:1:14/While you are still speaking with the king, I will come in and confirm your words."
11:1:15/Bathsheba went to see the king in his room, where he was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.
11:1:16/Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king. The king asked, "What do you wish?"
11:1:17/She replied, "My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your servant that Solomon your son would succeed you as king and sit on your throne.
11:1:18/But now, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, are unaware.
11:1:19/He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.
11:1:20/Now, my lord, O king, all Israel is looking to you to announce who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
11:1:21/If you do not act, when my lord the king rests with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals."
11:1:22/While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
11:1:23/They informed the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." When he entered the king's presence, he bowed before the king with his face to the ground.
11:1:24/Nathan said, "My lord, O king, have you declared that Adonijah will succeed you as king and sit on your throne?
11:1:25/Today he has gone down and sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Right now, they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
11:1:26/But he did not invite me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon.
11:1:27/Is this action authorized by my lord the king without you informing your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11:1:28/Then King David responded, "Call Bathsheba to me." She came into the king's presence and stood before him.
11:1:29/The king swore, "As the LORD lives, who has delivered my soul from every trouble,
11:1:30/just as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon your son shall succeed me as king, and he will sit on my throne in my place,' I will indeed fulfill this promise today."
11:1:31/Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, paying homage to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
11:1:32/King David said, "Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,
11:1:33/the king instructed them, "Take the servants of your lord with you, have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.
11:1:34/There, let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him as king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and proclaim, 'Long live King Solomon!'
11:1:35/Then follow him up, and he will come and sit on my throne, for he will be king in my place. I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah."
11:1:36/Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied to the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, endorse this decision.
11:1:37/May the LORD be with Solomon as he has been with my lord the king, and may he make Solomon's throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David."
11:1:38/So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule to Gihon.
11:1:39/Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people proclaimed, "Long live King Solomon!"
11:1:40/All the people followed him, playing flutes and celebrating with great joy, so that the ground shook with their noise.
11:1:41/Adonijah and all the guests with him heard it just as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he asked, "Why does the city sound like it's in chaos?"
11:1:42/As he was speaking, Jonathan, son of Abiathar the priest, arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a brave man and must be bringing good news."
11:1:43/Jonathan replied to Adonijah, "Actually, our lord King David has made Solomon king.
11:1:44/The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have made him ride on the king's mule.
11:1:45/Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. They have come up from there celebrating, and the city is buzzing with excitement. That's the noise you heard.
11:1:46/Moreover, Solomon now sits on the royal throne.
11:1:47/Furthermore, the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more renowned than yours and his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed in worship on his bed.
11:1:48/And the king also said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed someone to sit on my throne today, my own eyes seeing it.'"
11:1:49/All of Adonijah's guests panicked and dispersed in every direction.
11:1:50/Adonijah, fearing Solomon, got up and went to grasp the horns of the altar.
11:1:51/It was reported to Solomon, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and has seized the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'"
11:1:52/Solomon responded, "If he proves to be a worthy man, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he will die."
11:1:53/So King Solomon sent for him, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your home."
11:2:1/As David's time to die approached, he gave these instructions to his son Solomon,
11:2:2/"My time has come to follow the path all people must take. Be strong and show yourself to be a man.
11:2:3/Obey the LORD your God by following His ways and keeping His commands, rules, and laws as written in the Law of Moses. This will ensure you succeed in all you do and wherever you go.
11:2:4/Then the LORD will keep His promise to me: 'If your descendants are careful in their actions and live truthfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never lack a successor on the throne of Israel.'
11:2:5/Remember what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies—Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether—killing them in peacetime as if it were war, staining his belt and sandals with their blood.
11:2:6/Act according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go to the grave in peace.
11:2:7/But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table, for they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
11:2:8/And remember Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a vicious curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. Though he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, and I swore to him by the LORD, 'I will not put you to death with the sword,'
11:2:9/now do not consider him innocent. You are a wise man; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."
11:2:10/So David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David.
11:2:11/David ruled over Israel for forty years: seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
11:2:12/Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.
11:2:13/Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Peacefully."
11:2:14/He then said, "I have something to say to you." She replied, "Go ahead."
11:2:15/He said, "You know the kingdom was mine and all Israel looked to me as their king. However, the kingdom has turned to my brother, for it was his from the LORD.
11:2:16/Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." She said, "Go on."
11:2:17/He said, "Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."
11:2:18/Bathsheba replied, "Very well, I will speak to the king for you."
11:2:19/So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her, then sat on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.
11:2:20/Then she said, "I have one small request to make of you. Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Ask, my mother; I will not refuse you."
11:2:21/She said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife."
11:2:22/King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him, since he is my older brother, and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah."
11:2:23/Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah has not made this request at the cost of his life.
11:2:24/Now, as the LORD lives, who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as He promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today."
11:2:25/And King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah, and he died.
11:2:26/To Abiathar the priest, the king said, "Go to Anathoth, to your own fields. You deserve death, but I will not put you to death now because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and because you shared in all my father's hardships."
11:2:27/So Solomon removed Abiathar from being the LORD's priest, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.
11:2:28/When the news reached Joab—for Joab had sided with Adonijah though he had not sided with Absalom—he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.
11:2:29/It was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down."
11:2:30/So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king says, 'Come out.'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." Benaiah reported back to the king, saying, "This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me."
11:2:31/The king commanded Benaiah, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him. This will remove from me and my father's house the guilt for the innocent blood Joab shed.
11:2:32/The LORD will bring his blood back on his own head because he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself and killed them with the sword without my father David knowing it: Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army.
11:2:33/Their blood will return upon Joab's head and on his descendants forever. But for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there will be peace from the LORD forever."
11:2:34/So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and killed him. He was buried at his home in the desert.
11:2:35/The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and installed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
11:2:36/The king then summoned Shimei and told him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there. Do not leave the city.
11:2:37/For on the day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, know for certain you will surely die; your blood will be on your own head."
11:2:38/Shimei responded to the king, "What you say is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do." And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.
11:2:39/But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to Achish son of Maakah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, "Your slaves are in Gath."
11:2:40/So Shimei saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath to find his slaves. Shimei found them and brought them back from Gath.
11:2:41/When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,
11:2:42/the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave and go anywhere else, you will surely die'? And you said to me, 'The word I have heard is good.'
11:2:43/Why then have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command I gave you?"
11:2:44/The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wickedness.
11:2:45/But King Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be secure before the LORD forever."
11:2:46/Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who went out and struck down Shimei, and he died. The kingdom was now firmly in Solomon's control.
11:3:1/Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, by marrying Pharaoh's daughter. He brought her to the city of David until he finished building his palace, the temple of the LORD, and the surrounding walls of Jerusalem.
11:3:2/However, the people still offered sacrifices at high places because there was no temple dedicated to the LORD at that time.
11:3:3/Solomon was devoted to the LORD, following the practices of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places.
11:3:4/The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices because it was the most important high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
11:3:5/While in Gibeon, the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night. God said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."
11:3:6/Solomon replied, "You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day."
11:3:7/Now, LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a young man and do not know how to carry out my duties.
11:3:8/Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number.
11:3:9/So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?"
11:3:10/The LORD was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.
11:3:11/So God said to him, "Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice,
11:3:12/I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.
11:3:13/Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for—both wealth and honor—so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.
11:3:14/If you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life."
11:3:15/Solomon awoke and realized it was a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the LORD's covenant, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.
11:3:16/Two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
11:3:17/One of the women said, "My lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.
11:3:18/Three days after my child was born, this woman also gave birth. We were alone; there was no one else with us in the house.
11:3:19/But this woman's child died during the night because she lay on it.
11:3:20/She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I, your servant, was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast.
11:3:21/The next morning, I got up to nurse my son, and he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't the son I had borne."
11:3:22/The other woman interrupted, "No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours." But the first one insisted, "No, the dead one is yours; the living one is mine." And so they argued before the king.
11:3:23/The king said, "This one says, 'My son is alive and your son is dead,' while that one says, 'No, your son is dead and mine is alive.'"
11:3:24/Then the king commanded, "Bring me a sword." So they brought a sword for the king.
11:3:25/He then ordered, "Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other."
11:3:26/The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, "Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don't kill him!" But the other said, "Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!"
11:3:27/Then the king gave his ruling: "Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother."
11:3:28/When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
11:4:1/So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.
11:4:2/His top officials were Azariah, the son of Zadok the priest,
11:4:3/Elihoreph and Ahiah, sons of Shisha, secretaries; Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, the historian.
11:4:4/And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
11:4:5/Azariah, the son of Nathan, was in charge of the district governors; Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a principal officer and the king's close advisor.
11:4:6/Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram, the son of Abda, was in charge of forced labor.
11:4:7/Solomon had twelve district governors over all Israel, who supplied provisions for the king and his household; each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year.
11:4:8/Their names were: The son of Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
11:4:9/The son of Dekar, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elonbethhanan;
11:4:10/The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; he also had Sochoh and the whole territory of Hepher;
11:4:11/The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; he had Taphath, Solomon's daughter, as his wife.
11:4:12/Baana, the son of Ahilud, had Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth Shean next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam;
11:4:13/The son of Geber, in Ramoth Gilead; he had the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, in Gilead, and he also controlled the region of Argob in Bashan, sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate bars;
11:4:14/Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, had Mahanaim;
11:4:15/Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also married Basmath, Solomon's daughter;
11:4:16/Baanah, the son of Hushai, was in Asher and Aloth;
11:4:17/Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
11:4:18/Shimei, the son of Elah, in Benjamin;
11:4:19/Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Gilead, the territory of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; he was the only governor in the land.
11:4:20/Judah and Israel were numerous, like the sand by the sea in abundance, enjoying and feasting.
11:4:21/And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all his life.
11:4:22/Solomon's daily provisions were thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal,
11:4:23/Ten fattened oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, and a hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and choice poultry.
11:4:24/He had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around him.
11:4:25/And Judah and Israel lived in safety, each person under their own vine and fig tree, from Dan to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
11:4:26/Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand horsemen.
11:4:27/These district governors each in his month supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon's table; they made sure nothing was lacking.
11:4:28/They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it was required, each according to his responsibility.
11:4:29/And God gave Solomon exceptionally great wisdom and understanding, and a breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore.
11:4:30/Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.
11:4:31/He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame spread to all the surrounding nations.
11:4:32/He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
11:4:33/He spoke about plants, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
11:4:34/People from all nations came to listen to Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
11:5:1/And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father: for Hiram was always a great friend of David.
11:5:2/And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
11:5:3/You know how my father David couldn't build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars surrounding him on all sides, until the LORD put his enemies under his feet.
11:5:4/But now the LORD my God has given me peace on all sides, with no adversaries or misfortune.
11:5:5/And, look, I plan to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD told my father David, saying, 'Your son, whom I will place on your throne in your place, will build the house for my name.'
11:5:6/So now, please order that cedar trees be cut down for me from Lebanon; and my servants will join your servants: and I will pay you for your servants whatever you decide: for you know that there is no one among us who can cut timber like the Sidonians.
11:5:7/And when Hiram heard Solomon's message, he was very happy and said, "Praise be to the LORD today, who has given David a wise son to lead this great nation."
11:5:8/And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, "I have considered your request and will do all you desire regarding cedar and fir timber.
11:5:9/My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will transport them by sea in rafts to the place you specify, and have them unloaded there. You will then receive them, and you will fulfill my wish by providing food for my household."
11:5:10/So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and fir trees he wanted.
11:5:11/And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for his household and twenty measures of pure oil: this Solomon gave to Hiram year after year.
11:5:12/And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as promised: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they formed an alliance.
11:5:13/And King Solomon conscripted a labor force from all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men.
11:5:14/He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home: and Adoniram was in charge of the labor force.
11:5:15/And Solomon had seventy thousand who carried loads and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills;
11:5:16/Besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work, three thousand three hundred, who supervised the people working on the project.
11:5:17/And the king ordered them to quarry large, expensive stones to lay the foundation of the temple.
11:5:18/And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders cut them, and the stonecutters: so they prepared timber and stones to build the temple.
11:6:1/In the 480th year after the Israelites left Egypt, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif (the second month), Solomon began to build the LORD's temple.
11:6:2/The temple King Solomon built for the LORD was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.
11:6:3/The entrance porch in front of the temple was 20 cubits long, matching the width of the temple, and 10 cubits deep.
11:6:4/He made windows with narrow openings for the temple.
11:6:5/He built side rooms all around the walls of the temple, surrounding both the main hall and the inner sanctuary, creating a series of rooms.
11:6:6/The lowest row of rooms was five cubits wide, the middle row six cubits wide, and the top row seven cubits wide. He made offset ledges in the temple walls so that the beams wouldn't need to be inserted into the walls.
11:6:7/The temple was constructed with pre-cut stones, so there was no sound of hammers, axes, or any iron tools at the building site.
11:6:8/The entrance to the middle floor was on the south side of the temple, with winding stairs leading up to the middle level and from there to the top level.
11:6:9/He completed the temple, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.
11:6:10/He also built side rooms all around the temple, each five cubits high, which were attached to the temple with cedar timbers.
11:6:11/And the LORD spoke to Solomon, saying,
11:6:12/"Regarding this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, carry out my regulations, and keep all my commands, I will fulfill my promise to you as I did to your father David.
11:6:13/I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel."
11:6:14/So Solomon completed the temple.
11:6:15/He paneled the interior walls of the temple with cedar boards, covering the floor of the temple with pine planks.
11:6:16/He built 20 cubits of the rear part of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling for the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
11:6:17/The main hall in front of this room was 40 cubits long.
11:6:18/The cedar inside the temple was carved with gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was visible.
11:6:19/He prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple to house the Ark of the LORD's Covenant.
11:6:20/The inner sanctuary was 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 20 cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also covered the cedar altar with gold.
11:6:21/Solomon covered the interior of the temple with pure gold, and he made gold chains to curtain off the Holy of Holies, which he also overlaid with gold.
11:6:22/He covered the entire temple with gold, completing all the temple decorations, and he also covered the altar that belonged to the Holy of Holies with gold.
11:6:23/Inside the Holy of Holies, he made two cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
11:6:24/Each cherub had two wings, each wing five cubits long; the wingspan from one wingtip to the other was ten cubits.
11:6:25/The second cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape.
11:6:26/The height of each cherub was ten cubits.
11:6:27/He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the opposite wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.
11:6:28/He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
11:6:29/He carved all the walls of the temple around both the inner and outer rooms with figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
11:6:30/He overlaid the floor of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
11:6:31/For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood; the doorframes were five-sided.
11:6:32/The two doors were also made of olive wood, and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. He also spread gold over the cherubim and palm trees.
11:6:33/For the entrance to the main hall, he made doorframes of olive wood, which were four-sided.
11:6:34/The two doors were made of pine wood, each door consisting of two folding leaves.
11:6:35/He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold fitted smoothly over the carvings.
11:6:36/He built the inner courtyard with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams.
11:6:37/The foundation of the LORD's temple was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Zif.
11:6:38/And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (the eighth month), the temple was completed in all its details and according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.
11:7:1/But Solomon spent thirteen years building his own house until it was completely finished.
11:7:2/He also constructed the House of the Forest of Lebanon; it was 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, standing on four rows of cedar columns with cedar beams resting on the pillars.
11:7:3/The ceiling was covered with cedar above the beams that rested on forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.
11:7:4/There were windows in three rows, with light facing light in three sets.
11:7:5/All the doorways and doorposts were rectangular, with windows arranged in three sets, allowing light to face light.
11:7:6/He built a columned porch that was 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide. This porch was in front of them, with additional columns and a thick beam in front as well.
11:7:7/Then he constructed a porch for the throne where he would administer justice, called the Porch of Judgment. It was fully covered with cedar from the floor to the ceiling.
11:7:8/His own residence, where he lived, had another courtyard inside the porch, which was similar in design. Solomon also built a similar porch for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
11:7:9/All these structures were made of expensive stones, cut to size and sawed with saws on their inner and outer surfaces, from the foundation to the eaves, and on the outside toward the great courtyard.
11:7:10/The foundation was laid with expensive, large stones, some ten cubits and some eight cubits in size.
11:7:11/Above these were high-quality stones, cut to measure, and cedar wood.
11:7:12/The great courtyard was surrounded by three rows of cut stones and a row of cedar beams, just like the inner courtyard of the LORD's house and the porch of the house.
11:7:13/King Solomon sent for Hiram from Tyre.
11:7:14/He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a Tyrian craftsman in bronze. Hiram was extremely skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced in all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and completed all his bronze work.
11:7:15/He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high, with a circumference of twelve cubits around each.
11:7:16/He made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.
11:7:17/He created nets of checkerwork and wreaths of chainwork for the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital.
11:7:18/He made the pillars, with two rows of pomegranates around each network to decorate the capitals on top, and did the same for the other capital.
11:7:19/The capitals on top of the pillars in the porch were designed with lilies, four cubits high.
11:7:20/The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, next to the rounded part next to the network, with two hundred pomegranates in rows around each capital.
11:7:21/He erected the pillars at the porch of the temple: the right pillar he named Jachin and the left pillar he named Boaz.
11:7:22/The tops of the pillars were decorated with lily designs. Thus, the work on the pillars was completed.
11:7:23/He made a large basin of cast metal, ten cubits from rim to rim, circular in shape, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference.
11:7:24/Under the rim, gourds encircled it, ten to a cubit, all the way around the basin, cast in two rows when it was cast.
11:7:25/It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the basin rested on top of them, and their rear parts were all inward.
11:7:26/It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold two thousand baths.
11:7:27/He made ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
11:7:28/The stands had designs that included borders, and the borders were between the frames.
11:7:29/On the borders between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames above and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hammered work.
11:7:30/Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports. Under the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side.
11:7:31/Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit in diameter, and the opening was round, fashioned as a pedestal, one and a half cubits in diameter. On its opening were carvings, and their borders were square, not round.
11:7:32/The four wheels were below the borders, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. Each wheel was a cubit and a half in diameter.
11:7:33/The design of the wheels was like that of chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all cast metal.
11:7:34/There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports were part of the stand itself.
11:7:35/At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were of the same piece.
11:7:36/On the plates of its stays and on its borders, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.
11:7:37/This is how he made the ten stands. All of them had the same casting, the same measure, and the same shape.
11:7:38/Then he made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and each four cubits wide, one basin on each of the ten stands.
11:7:39/He placed five stands on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, to the southeast.
11:7:40/Hiram made the basins, shovels, and bowls. So Hiram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the LORD's house.
11:7:41/The two pillars, the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars, the two sets of network to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars,
11:7:42/Four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars),
11:7:43/The ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands,
11:7:44/The one Sea, and the twelve oxen under the Sea,
11:7:45/The pots, shovels, and bowls. All these items that Hiram made for King Solomon for the LORD's house were of polished bronze.
11:7:46/The king had them cast in the Jordan Valley in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
11:7:47/Solomon left all the items unweighed because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
11:7:48/Solomon made all the furnishings that were in the LORD's house: the gold altar, the gold table for the bread of the Presence,
11:7:49/The pure gold lampstands, five on the right and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold,
11:7:50/The cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, all of pure gold; and the hinges for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the main hall of the temple, were of gold.
11:7:51/Thus all the work King Solomon did for the house of the LORD was completed. Solomon then brought in the dedications of his father David, the silver, the gold, and the furnishings, and placed them in the treasuries of the LORD's house.
11:8:1/Then Solomon gathered the leaders of Israel, all the tribal heads, and the chiefs of the families of the children of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, so they could bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion.
11:8:2/All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon during the festival in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
11:8:3/All the elders of Israel arrived, and the priests carried the ark.
11:8:4/They brought up the ark of the LORD, the meeting tent, and all the sacred items that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites carried them all.
11:8:5/King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered around him were before the ark, offering so many sheep and oxen that they couldn't be counted.
11:8:6/The priests placed the ark of the covenant of the LORD in its spot, inside the inner sanctuary of the temple, under the wings of the cherubim.
11:8:7/The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, covering the ark and its carrying poles from above.
11:8:8/They extended the poles so that the ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not visible from outside. They are still there to this day.
11:8:9/Inside the ark were only the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt.
11:8:10/When the priests exited the Holy Place, a cloud filled the LORD's temple,
11:8:11/making it impossible for the priests to stand and perform their duties because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
11:8:12/Then Solomon declared, "The LORD has said He would dwell in thick darkness.
11:8:13/I have indeed built You a magnificent house, a place for You to dwell forever."
11:8:14/The king then turned around and blessed the entire assembly of Israel while they all stood.
11:8:15/He said, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke directly to my father David and has fulfilled His promise with His own hands, saying,
11:8:16/'Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel to build a temple for My Name to be there. But I have chosen David to rule over My people Israel.'
11:8:17/My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
11:8:18/But the LORD said to my father David, 'It was good that it was in your heart to build a temple for My Name.
11:8:19/However, you will not build the temple; instead, your son, your own offspring, will build the temple for My Name.'
11:8:20/The LORD has kept the promise He made. I have succeeded David my father and now sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
11:8:21/And I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that He made with our ancestors when He brought them out of Egypt."
11:8:22/Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
11:8:23/He said, "LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.
11:8:24/You have kept Your promise to Your servant David my father; You spoke with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is today.
11:8:25/Now therefore, LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father what You have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your children pay attention to their way, to walk before Me as you have walked before Me.'
11:8:26/Now, O God of Israel, let Your word to Your servant David my father be confirmed.
11:8:27/But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house that I have built!
11:8:28/Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that Your servant prays before You today,
11:8:29/that Your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which You have said, 'My Name shall be there,' that You may listen to the prayer that Your servant offers toward this place.
11:8:30/And listen to the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and when You hear, forgive.
11:8:31/If anyone sins against their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before Your altar in this house,
11:8:32/then hear in heaven and act. Judge Your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing their conduct on their own heads, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding them according to their righteousness.
11:8:33/When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they turn back to You and confess Your name, praying and making supplication to You in this house,
11:8:34/then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land You gave to their ancestors.
11:8:35/When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, turning from their sin because You have afflicted them,
11:8:36/then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land You gave Your people for an inheritance.
11:8:37/If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,
11:8:38/whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any individual or by all Your people Israel, each knowing the afflictions of their own heart, and spreading out their hands toward this house,
11:8:39/then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, forgive, act, and render to each whose heart You know, according to all their ways, for You, You only, know the hearts of all the children of mankind,
11:8:40/so that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You gave to our ancestors.
11:8:41/Also concerning the foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel but comes from a far country for the sake of Your name
11:8:42/(for they shall hear of Your great name and Your mighty hand and of Your outstretched arm), when they come and pray toward this house,
11:8:43/hear in heaven Your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by Your name.
11:8:44/If Your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever You send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your name,
11:8:45/then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
11:8:46/If they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin) and You are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are taken captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near,
11:8:47/yet if they take it to heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, 'We have sinned and acted perversely and wickedly,'
11:8:48/if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to You toward their land which You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your name,
11:8:49/then hear in heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause,
11:8:50/and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions that they have committed against You, and grant them compassion in the sight of those who took them captive, that they may have compassion on them,
11:8:51/for they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out of Egypt, out of the iron furnace.
11:8:52/Let Your eyes be open to the plea of Your servant and to the plea of Your people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to You.
11:8:53/For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, as You declared through Moses Your servant, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
11:8:54/And so, when Solomon finished praying all this prayer and plea to the LORD, he rose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.
11:8:55/He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying,
11:8:56/"Praise be to the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel according to everything He promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses.
11:8:57/May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our ancestors; may He never leave us nor forsake us,
11:8:58/so that He may incline our hearts to Him, to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, which He commanded our ancestors.
11:8:59/And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that He may uphold the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel as each day requires,
11:8:60/so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other.
11:8:61/Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the LORD our God, walking in His statutes and keeping His commandments, as at this day."
11:8:62/Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
11:8:63/Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD.
11:8:64/That same day, the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the LORD's temple. There he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to hold the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
11:8:65/At that time, Solomon held a festival, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, for seven days and seven more days, fourteen days in total.
11:8:66/On the eighth day, he sent the people away. They blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David His servant and to Israel His people.
11:9:1/When Solomon had completed the construction of the LORD's temple, the royal palace, and all that he desired to accomplish,
11:9:2/the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, just as He had at Gibeon.
11:9:3/The LORD told him, "I have listened to your prayer and plea you presented before me. I have consecrated this temple you have built by placing my name there forever; my eyes and my heart will always be there.
11:9:4/If you live in my presence as your father David did, with a pure heart and honesty, following all my commands and keeping my decrees and laws,
11:9:5/then I will secure your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, 'You will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.'
11:9:6/However, if you or your descendants turn away from me, if you do not observe my commands and decrees I have given you, and go off to serve other gods and worship them,
11:9:7/then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them. I will reject this temple I have consecrated for my name, and Israel will become a joke and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
11:9:8/And regarding this temple, now so exalted, everyone who passes by will be shocked and will scoff, asking, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'
11:9:9/People will answer, 'Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them. That is why the LORD has brought all this disaster on them.'
11:9:10/At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the two buildings, the LORD's temple and the royal palace,
11:9:11/(King Hiram of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress logs and gold, as much as he desired), Solomon then gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee.
11:9:12/When Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
11:9:13/"What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul, a name they have to this day.
11:9:14/Then Hiram sent the king 120 talents of gold.
11:9:15/This is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
11:9:16/Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer, burned it down, killed the Canaanites who lived there, and given it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
11:9:17/So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth Horon,
11:9:18/Baalath, and Tadmor in the desert, within his land,
11:9:19/as well as all his store cities, the towns for his chariots and for his horses, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the territory he ruled.
11:9:20/All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites,
11:9:21/their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not completely exterminate, Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.
11:9:22/But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites; they were his soldiers, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
11:9:23/These were the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects, 550 officials supervising the people who did the work.
11:9:24/After Pharaoh's daughter moved from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he then built the Millo.
11:9:25/Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so completed the temple.
11:9:26/King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
11:9:27/And Hiram sent his experienced sailors to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men.
11:9:28/They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
11:10:1/When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's fame and his relationship with the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions.
11:10:2/She arrived in Jerusalem with a very impressive entourage, with camels carrying spices, a lot of gold, and precious stones. Upon her arrival, she discussed everything on her mind with Solomon.
11:10:3/Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing he didn't explain to her.
11:10:4/When the queen of Sheba witnessed Solomon's wisdom, and the palace he had built,
11:10:5/And the food on his table, the organization of his officials, the attentive service of his ministers, their attire, his cupbearers, and the stairway he used to go up to the house of the LORD, she was utterly amazed.
11:10:6/She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
11:10:7/But I didn't believe these reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me; your wisdom and prosperity surpass the fame I had heard.
11:10:8/Your men are fortunate, and your servants who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom are even more so.
11:10:9/Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel. Because the LORD loves Israel forever, he made you king to administer justice and righteousness."
11:10:10/And she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a huge quantity of spices, and precious stones. No such abundance of spices had ever been brought as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
11:10:11/The fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought a large quantity of almug trees and precious stones.
11:10:12/The king used the almug trees to make supports for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. No such almug trees have been seen to this day.
11:10:13/King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal generosity. Then she returned to her own country, along with her servants.
11:10:14/The total weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents,
11:10:15/Besides what he received from the merchants, the profits from the traders, and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land.
11:10:16/King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield.
11:10:17/He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king placed them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
11:10:18/Furthermore, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold.
11:10:19/The throne had six steps, and a rounded top at the back. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.
11:10:20/Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had been made for any other kingdom.
11:10:21/All of King Solomon's drinking vessels were gold, and all the utensils of the Forest of Lebanon Palace were pure gold. Silver was considered of little value in Solomon's days.
11:10:22/The king had a fleet of Tarshish ships at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Every three years, the fleet of Tarshish ships brought gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
11:10:23/Thus, King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
11:10:24/People from all over the world sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had placed in his heart.
11:10:25/They brought him gifts—silver and gold vessels, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules—as tribute year after year.
11:10:26/Solomon accumulated chariots and horsemen; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
11:10:27/The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as the sycamore fig trees in the lowland.
11:10:28/Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at a fixed price.
11:10:29/A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150. And in this way, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
11:11:1/But King Solomon loved many foreign women, including the daughter of Pharaoh, as well as women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittites.
11:11:2/From the nations about which the LORD warned the Israelites, saying, "You must not engage with them, nor should they with you, for they will surely turn your heart towards their gods." Yet, Solomon was deeply attached to them in love.
11:11:3/He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.
11:11:4/As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, unlike his father David's heart.
11:11:5/Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom the detestable god of the Ammonites.
11:11:6/And Solomon did what was evil in the LORD's sight, failing to follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done.
11:11:7/Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, on the hill facing Jerusalem, and for Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.
11:11:8/And he did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.
11:11:9/And the LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
11:11:10/And had specifically commanded him not to follow other gods, but he did not keep the LORD's command.
11:11:11/Therefore, the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
11:11:12/However, during your lifetime, I will not do it, out of respect for your father David. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
11:11:13/Yet I will not tear the entire kingdom away; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
11:11:14/And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
11:11:15/For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the dead, after he had killed every male in Edom;
11:11:16/(For Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he had eliminated every male in Edom.)
11:11:17/Hadad fled, along with some Edomite officials from his father's service, to Egypt, while Hadad was still a young boy.
11:11:18/They set out from Midian and arrived in Paran. Then, taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house, provided him with food, and allotted him land.
11:11:19/And Hadad gained great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, so much so that he gave him the sister of his own wife, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.
11:11:20/And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's palace; and Genubath lived in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
11:11:21/When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had passed away and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me leave, so that I can return to my own country."
11:11:22/Then Pharaoh asked him, "What have you lacked with me that you are seeking to go back to your own country?" And he replied, "Nothing, but please let me go anyway."
11:11:23/And God raised up another adversary against Solomon, Rezon son of Eliadah, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah.
11:11:24/He gathered men around him and became the leader of a marauding band after David killed those of Zobah. They went to Damascus, settled there, and took control of Damascus.
11:11:25/He was an adversary to Israel throughout Solomon's reign, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. He detested Israel and ruled over Aram.
11:11:26/And Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king.
11:11:27/The reason he rebelled against the king was that Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the breaches in the city of David, his father.
11:11:28/Jeroboam was a strong and valiant man, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of all the labor force of the house of Joseph.
11:11:29/It happened at that time when Jeroboam left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open field.
11:11:30/Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
11:11:31/And he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I am about to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.
11:11:32/(But he will have one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel.)
11:11:33/Because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my statutes and judgments, as David his father did.
11:11:34/However, I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand; I will make him ruler for all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose, because he kept my commands and statutes.
11:11:35/But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and give it to you, even ten tribes.
11:11:36/And to his son, I will give one tribe, so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen to put my Name.
11:11:37/And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
11:11:38/And it shall be, if you listen to all that I command you, walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, then I will be with you and build you a lasting dynasty, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
11:11:39/And I will afflict David's descendants because of this, but not forever."
11:11:40/Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and stayed in Egypt until Solomon's death.
11:11:41/And the rest of the acts of Solomon, all he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
11:11:42/And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
11:11:43/And Solomon rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
11:12:1/And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
11:12:2/When Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who was still in Egypt, heard about it (since he had fled from King Solomon and was living in Egypt),
11:12:3/They sent for him. So Jeroboam and the entire assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
11:12:4/Your father made our burden unbearable: now, please lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.
11:12:5/He told them, "Leave for three days, then come back to me." So the people left.
11:12:6/King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was alive, asking, "How do you advise me to respond to these people?"
11:12:7/They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people, serve them, respond kindly to them, and speak encouraging words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
11:12:8/But he ignored the advice the elders had given him and consulted the young men he had grown up with, who were now his advisors.
11:12:9/He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who have asked me to lighten the yoke my father put on them?"
11:12:10/The young men he had grown up with said to him, "Tell these people who complained about your father's heavy yoke, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
11:12:11/My father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke: my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
11:12:12/So Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had directed, saying, "Come back to me on the third day."
11:12:13/The king answered the people harshly, rejecting the advice the elders had given him,
11:12:14/And followed the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
11:12:15/Therefore, the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill his word, which the LORD had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11:12:16/When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered the king, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, David!" So the Israelites went home.
11:12:17/But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
11:12:18/Then King Rehoboam sent out Adoram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
11:12:19/So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
11:12:20/When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent for him and invited him to the assembly. They made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
11:12:21/When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the entire house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—180,000 select troops—to fight against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom to himself.
11:12:22/But the word of God came to Shemaiah, the man of God,
11:12:23/Telling Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people,
11:12:24/"This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Everyone, go home, because this is my doing." They obeyed the word of the LORD and turned back, according to the word of the LORD.
11:12:25/Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Penuel.
11:12:26/And Jeroboam thought to himself, "Now the kingdom might revert to the house of David.
11:12:27/If these people continue to offer sacrifices in the temple of the LORD at Jerusalem, their hearts will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam of Judah."
11:12:28/After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It's too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."
11:12:29/He set one up in Bethel and the other in Dan.
11:12:30/This act became a sin; the people went to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.
11:12:31/Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, who were not of the Levites.
11:12:32/He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.
11:12:33/On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
11:13:1/A man of God came from Judah to Bethel by the LORD's command, while Jeroboam was at the altar burning incense.
11:13:2/He proclaimed against the altar by the LORD's command, "O altar, altar, the LORD says: 'A child named Josiah will be born to the house of David. He will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones will be burned on you.'"
11:13:3/He gave a sign that day, saying, "This is the sign the LORD has declared: The altar will be split apart, and the ashes on it will be spilled out."
11:13:4/When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar in Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Seize him!" But his hand, which he had stretched out against him, dried up, so he could not pull it back.
11:13:5/The altar also split apart, and the ashes spilled out from the altar, according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD.
11:13:6/The king pleaded with the man of God, "Please ask the LORD your God to restore my hand." So the man of God prayed to the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him, as it was before.
11:13:7/The king said to the man of God, "Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a reward."
11:13:8/But the man of God said to the king, "Even if you gave me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here.
11:13:9/For I was commanded by the word of the LORD, 'Do not eat bread or drink water, nor return by the way you came.'"
11:13:10/So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
11:13:11/An old prophet lived in Bethel; his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel and the words he had spoken to the king, which they also reported to their father.
11:13:12/Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" His sons showed him the road the man of God from Judah had taken.
11:13:13/He said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him, and he rode on it.
11:13:14/He went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. He asked, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "I am," he replied.
11:13:15/Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat."
11:13:16/But he replied, "I cannot go back with you or eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
11:13:17/I have been told by the word of the LORD, 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'"
11:13:18/The old prophet said, "I too am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'" But he was lying to him.
11:13:19/So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.
11:13:20/While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
11:13:21/He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because you have disobeyed the LORD's command and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you,
11:13:22/but have come back and eaten bread and drunk water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink, your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors.'"
11:13:23/After the man of God had eaten and drunk, the prophet who had brought him back saddled the donkey for him.
11:13:24/As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
11:13:25/People passing by saw the body thrown down and the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
11:13:26/When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard about it, he said, "It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD. The LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD he had spoken."
11:13:27/He said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." And they did.
11:13:28/He went and found the body thrown down on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or mauled the donkey.
11:13:29/The prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to the city to mourn and to bury him.
11:13:30/He laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him, saying, "Oh, my brother!"
11:13:31/After burying him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
11:13:32/For the message he declared by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."
11:13:33/Despite this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once again appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places.
11:13:34/This act became a sin for the house of Jeroboam, leading to its destruction and elimination from the face of the earth.
11:14:1/At that time Abijah, Jeroboam's son, became ill.
11:14:2/Jeroboam told his wife, "Please get up and disguise yourself so no one knows you're my wife. Go to Shiloh; there you'll find Ahijah the prophet who told me I'd be king over this nation.
11:14:3/Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to our child."
11:14:4/Jeroboam's wife did as instructed, went to Shiloh, and arrived at Ahijah's house. Ahijah couldn't see because he was very old.
11:14:5/The LORD said to Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is sick. Tell her exactly this and that. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else."
11:14:6/When Ahijah heard her footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in, Jeroboam's wife. Why pretend to be someone else? I have difficult news for you.
11:14:7/Tell Jeroboam, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I raised you from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.
11:14:8/I tore the kingdom away from David's house and gave it to you. Yet, you haven't been like my servant David, who obeyed my commands and followed me wholeheartedly, doing only what was right in my eyes.
11:14:9/Instead, you have done more evil than anyone before you. You made other gods and idols, angering me and turning your back on me.
11:14:10/So, I will bring disaster on Jeroboam's family. I will eliminate every male in Jeroboam's line, whether slave or free in Israel. I will sweep away the remnants of Jeroboam's house as one clears away dung until it's all gone.
11:14:11/Anyone from Jeroboam's family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by birds. The LORD has spoken.'
11:14:12/So, go back home. As soon as you enter the city, your child will die.
11:14:13/All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one from Jeroboam's family who will receive a proper burial because there is something good in him toward the LORD God of Israel.
11:14:14/The LORD will appoint a new king over Israel who will destroy Jeroboam's family. This is happening now.
11:14:15/The LORD will strike Israel, making it shake like a reed in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land given to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River because they made Asherah poles, angering the LORD.
11:14:16/And because of Jeroboam's sins, which led Israel into sin, the LORD will give up Israel.
11:14:17/Jeroboam's wife got up, left, and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of her house, the child died.
11:14:18/They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had said through his servant Ahijah the prophet.
11:14:19/The rest of Jeroboam's acts, his wars, and his reign, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
11:14:20/Jeroboam reigned for twenty-two years. Then he died, and his son Nadab succeeded him as king.
11:14:21/Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king of Judah. He was forty-one when he began to reign and ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city chosen by the LORD from all the tribes of Israel. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite.
11:14:22/Judah did what was evil in the LORD's sight, provoking him to jealousy with their sins, more than their ancestors had done.
11:14:23/They also built high places, sacred stones, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
11:14:24/There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land. They followed all the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
11:14:25/In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem.
11:14:26/He took away the treasures of the LORD's temple and the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
11:14:27/King Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and assigned them to the commanders of the guard who watched over the entrance to the royal palace.
11:14:28/Whenever the king went to the LORD's temple, the guards carried the shields and later returned them to the guardroom.
11:14:29/The rest of Rehoboam's acts, everything he did, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
11:14:30/There was continuous war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
11:14:31/Rehoboam died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite. His son Abijam succeeded him as king.
11:15:1/In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam began his reign over Judah.
11:15:2/He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
11:15:3/He followed all the sins his father had committed before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, unlike his ancestor David.
11:15:4/Yet, for David's sake, the LORD his God allowed him to maintain a presence in Jerusalem, to establish his son after him, and to secure Jerusalem.
11:15:5/Because David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not turned away from anything He commanded him throughout his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.
11:15:6/There was ongoing war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their lives.
11:15:7/The rest of the deeds of Abijam, and everything he did, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
11:15:8/Abijam passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David; and Asa his son succeeded him as king.
11:15:9/In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.
11:15:10/He ruled for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
11:15:11/Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his ancestor David had done.
11:15:12/He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made.
11:15:13/He even removed his grandmother Maachah from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive idol for Asherah worship; Asa destroyed her idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
11:15:14/However, the high places were not removed. Nevertheless, Asa's heart remained fully committed to the LORD all his life.
11:15:15/He brought into the temple of the LORD the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
11:15:16/There was constant war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
11:15:17/Baasha king of Israel attacked Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from going to or coming from Asa king of Judah.
11:15:18/Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and the royal palace and sent them to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus, saying,
11:15:19/"Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."
11:15:20/Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the towns of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and all Kinnereth, along with the territory of Naphtali.
11:15:21/When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
11:15:22/Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah; no one was exempted: they removed the stones and timber Baasha had used to fortify Ramah. With them, King Asa fortified Geba in Benjamin and Mizpah.
11:15:23/The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his power, everything he did, and the cities he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? However, in his old age, he suffered from a disease in his feet.
11:15:24/Asa passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. His son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king.
11:15:25/Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and ruled over Israel for two years.
11:15:26/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the ways of his father and leading Israel into sin.
11:15:27/Baasha son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar, plotted against him and killed him at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and the Israelite army were besieging it.
11:15:28/In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed Nadab and succeeded him as king.
11:15:29/As soon as he became king, he killed all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave any living member of Jeroboam's family, fulfilling the word of the LORD spoken by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
11:15:30/Because of the sins Jeroboam committed and caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.
11:15:31/The rest of the acts of Nadab and all he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
11:15:32/There was constant war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
11:15:33/In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah and reigned for twenty-four years.
11:15:34/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the ways of Jeroboam and leading Israel into sin.
11:16:1/Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, 
11:16:2/Since I lifted you from obscurity and made you leader over my people Israel, but you have followed Jeroboam's ways, causing my people Israel to sin and angering me with their sins;
11:16:3/Behold, I will eliminate the descendants of Baasha, and the descendants of his house; and will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
11:16:4/Anyone from Baasha's family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs; and those who die in the fields will be eaten by the birds of the air.
11:16:5/Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
11:16:6/So Baasha rested with his ancestors, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his place.
11:16:7/And also through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani, the word of the LORD came against Baasha, and against his house, for all the evil he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, by being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
11:16:8/In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, for two years.
11:16:9/And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him while he was in Tirzah, getting drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah.
11:16:10/And Zimri went in, struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
11:16:11/And it happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he killed all the house of Baasha: he did not leave anyone who urinates against a wall, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.
11:16:12/Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet.
11:16:13/For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their worthless idols.
11:16:14/Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
11:16:15/In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
11:16:16/And the people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also slain the king: therefore, all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
11:16:17/And Omri went up from Gibbethon, with all Israel, and they besieged Tirzah.
11:16:18/And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died.
11:16:19/For his sins which he sinned, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, making Israel to sin.
11:16:20/Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
11:16:21/Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
11:16:22/But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
11:16:23/In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, for twelve years: six years he reigned in Tirzah.
11:16:24/And he bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, built on the hill, and named the city he built after Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.
11:16:25/But Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and acted worse than all those before him.
11:16:26/For he followed all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins which made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their worthless idols.
11:16:27/Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
11:16:28/So Omri rested with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
11:16:29/And in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
11:16:30/And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all those before him.
11:16:31/And it happened, as if it had been a trivial thing for him to follow the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
11:16:32/And he set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
11:16:33/And Ahab made a sacred grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
11:16:34/In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho: he laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn Abiram, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke through Joshua the son of Nun.
11:17:1/Elijah the Tishbite, from Gilead, told Ahab, "As surely as the LORD God of Israel lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the coming years except at my word."
11:17:2/And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
11:17:3/"Leave this place, go east and hide by the Cherith Brook, east of the Jordan.
11:17:4/You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there."
11:17:5/So he did as the LORD had told him; he went and lived by the Cherith Brook, east of the Jordan.
11:17:6/The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
11:17:7/Eventually, the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.
11:17:8/And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
11:17:9/"Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food."
11:17:10/So he went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, "Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?"
11:17:11/As she was going to get it, he called, "And bring me, please, a piece of bread."
11:17:12/"As surely as the LORD your God lives," she replied, "I don't have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die."
11:17:13/Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.
11:17:14/For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain on the land.'"
11:17:15/She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah, for the woman, and for her family.
11:17:16/The jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.
11:17:17/Some time later, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.
11:17:18/She said to Elijah, "What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?"
11:17:19/"Give me your son," Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.
11:17:20/Then he cried out to the LORD, "LORD my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?"
11:17:21/Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the LORD, "LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!"
11:17:22/The LORD listened to Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.
11:17:23/Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive!"
11:17:24/Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth."
11:18:1/After a long time, the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land."
11:18:2/Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Meanwhile, there was a severe famine in Samaria.
11:18:3/Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD.
11:18:4/When Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets, hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.)
11:18:5/Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we don't lose any animals."
11:18:6/They divided the land between them to cover it: Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.
11:18:7/As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?"
11:18:8/He replied, "Yes, it's me. Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"
11:18:9/Obadiah said, "What have I done wrong that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be killed?
11:18:10/As surely as the LORD your God lives, there isn't a nation or kingdom where my master hasn't sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they couldn't find you.
11:18:11/But now you're telling me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.'
11:18:12/I'm afraid that as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the LORD will take you somewhere I don't know. Then when I tell Ahab and he can't find you, he'll kill me. Yet I, your servant, have worshiped the LORD since my youth.
11:18:13/Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did when Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.
11:18:14/And now you're telling me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here'; he'll surely kill me."
11:18:15/Elijah said, "As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today."
11:18:16/So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
11:18:17/When Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"
11:18:18/Elijah answered, "I haven't troubled Israel; you and your father's family have, by abandoning the LORD's commands and following the Baals.
11:18:19/Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
11:18:20/So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
11:18:21/Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing.
11:18:22/Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
11:18:23/Let them give us two bulls. Let them choose one for themselves, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and place it on the wood but not set fire to it.
11:18:24/Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire—he is God." Then all the people said, "What you say is good."
11:18:25/Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire."
11:18:26/So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, shouting, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.
11:18:27/At noon, Elijah began to taunt them. "Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened."
11:18:28/So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.
11:18:29/Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
11:18:30/Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come here to me." They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which had been torn down.
11:18:31/Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Your name shall be Israel."
11:18:32/With the stones, he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
11:18:33/He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces, and laid it on the wood. Then he said, "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood."
11:18:34/Then he said, "Do it again," and they did it again. "Do it a third time," he ordered, and they did it the third time.
11:18:35/The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
11:18:36/At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: "LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
11:18:37/Answer me, LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."
11:18:38/Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.
11:18:39/When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD—he is God! The LORD—he is God!"
11:18:40/Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.
11:18:41/Then Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain."
11:18:42/So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.
11:18:43/He said to his servant, "Go and look toward the sea." The servant went up and looked, then said, "There is nothing." Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."
11:18:44/On the seventh time, the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"
11:18:45/Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.
11:18:46/The power of the LORD came on Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to the entrance of Jezreel.
11:19:1/Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
11:19:2/Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "May the gods punish me severely if I don't make your life like one of those prophets by this time tomorrow."
11:19:3/Seeing this, he got up, fled for his life, and arrived at Beersheba in Judah, where he left his servant.
11:19:4/But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, sat down under a juniper tree, and wished for his own death, saying, "It's enough; now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."
11:19:5/While he was sleeping under the juniper tree, suddenly an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat."
11:19:6/He looked around, and there by his head was a cake baked over hot coals and a jar of water. He ate and drank, then lay down again.
11:19:7/The angel of the LORD came back a second time, touched him, and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey ahead is too much for you."
11:19:8/So he got up, ate and drank, and traveled forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God, strengthened by that food.
11:19:9/When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. Then the word of the LORD came to him, asking, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11:19:10/He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have abandoned your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I'm the only one left, and now they're trying to kill me too."
11:19:11/Then he was told, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
11:19:12/After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
11:19:13/When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his cloak, went out, and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11:19:14/He answered, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have abandoned your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I'm the only one left, and now they're trying to kill me too."
11:19:15/Then the LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.
11:19:16/Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.
11:19:17/Anyone who escapes the sword of Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and anyone who escapes the sword of Jehu will be killed by Elisha.
11:19:18/Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him."
11:19:19/So Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing with twelve pairs of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
11:19:20/Elisha then left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you." Elijah replied, "Go back. What have I done to you?"
11:19:21/So Elisha turned back from him, took a pair of oxen, slaughtered them, and cooked the meat using the plowing equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.
11:20:1/And Benhadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his forces together: there were thirty-two kings with him, along with horses and chariots. He advanced to besiege Samaria and waged war against it.
11:20:2/He sent messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, inside the city, saying to him, "This is what Benhadad demands: 
11:20:3/Your silver and gold are mine; your wives and your children, even the most attractive ones, belong to me."
11:20:4/The king of Israel responded, "As you say, my lord, O king, I and all I have are yours."
11:20:5/The messengers returned and said, "Benhadad insists, 'Although I demanded your silver, gold, wives, and children,
11:20:6/I will send my servants to you tomorrow around this time, and they will search your palace and the homes of your officials. Anything they find desirable, they will take."
11:20:7/Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, "Notice how this man is looking for trouble. He demanded my wives, children, silver, and gold, and I did not refuse him."
11:20:8/All the elders and the people advised him, "Do not listen to him or agree to his demands."
11:20:9/So he told Benhadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king, 'I will do all you first asked of me, but this request I cannot fulfill.'" The messengers left and relayed the message.
11:20:10/Benhadad then sent this message: "May the gods deal harshly with me if there's enough dust in Samaria for all my followers to grab a handful."
11:20:11/The king of Israel replied, "Tell him, 'One should not boast as though they are putting on armor when they are taking it off.'"
11:20:12/When Benhadad received this message, he was drinking with the kings in the tents and ordered, "Prepare for battle!" So they prepared to attack the city.
11:20:13/Then a prophet approached Ahab, king of Israel, and announced, "This is what the LORD says: 'Do you see this vast army? Today, I will deliver it into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"
11:20:14/Ahab asked, "Through whom?" The prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says: 'Through the young leaders of the provinces.'" Then Ahab asked, "Who will start the battle?" He answered, "You will."
11:20:15/So he mustered the young leaders of the provinces, numbering two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the Israelites, seven thousand in total.
11:20:16/They launched their attack at noon while Benhadad and the thirty-two kings allied with him were getting drunk in their tents.
11:20:17/The young leaders of the provinces went out first. Benhadad sent out scouts, who reported, "Men are coming out of Samaria."
11:20:18/He said, "Whether they come for peace or for war, capture them alive."
11:20:19/So the young leaders and the army following them came out of the city,
11:20:20/and each killed his opponent. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Benhadad, king of Syria, managed to escape on horseback with some horsemen.
11:20:21/The king of Israel attacked, destroying the horses and chariots, and inflicted a great defeat on the Syrians.
11:20:22/Then the prophet came to the king of Israel and advised him, "Strengthen your position and consider what you must do, because next spring the king of Syria will attack you again."
11:20:23/The officials of the king of Syria advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That's why they were stronger than us. But if we fight them on the plains, we will surely be stronger than they are."
11:20:24/"Do this: Remove each king from his position and replace them with captains.
11:20:25/Recruit an army like the one you lost, horse for horse, chariot for chariot, and we will fight them on the plains. We will surely be stronger than they are." He agreed with their advice and did so.
11:20:26/At the return of the year, Benhadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
11:20:27/The Israelites were mustered and supplied, and they went to meet the Syrians. The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the countryside.
11:20:28/Then a man of God came and told the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because the Syrians have said, "The LORD is a god of the hills but not a god of the valleys," I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"
11:20:29/For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle ensued. The Israelites killed a hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in one day.
11:20:30/The survivors fled to Aphek, into the city, but the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men. And Benhadad fled and hid in an inner room in the city.
11:20:31/His officials said to him, "We've heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let's dress in sackcloth, put ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life."
11:20:32/So they dressed in sackcloth, put ropes around their heads, and went to the king of Israel. They said, "Your servant Benhadad pleads, 'Please let me live.'" The king responded, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."
11:20:33/The men took this as a good sign and quickly grasped at his words. "Yes, your brother Benhadad," they said. "Go and bring him," the king said. When Benhadad came out to him, the king invited him up into his chariot.
11:20:34/Benhadad offered, "I will return the cities my father took from your father. And you may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." Ahab replied, "On these terms, I will release you." So he made a treaty with him and let him go.
11:20:35/One of the sons of the prophets said to his companion by the word of the LORD, "Hit me, please." But the man refused to strike him.
11:20:36/He then said, "Because you have not obeyed the LORD's voice, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you." And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and killed him.
11:20:37/He found another man and said, "Please hit me." The man struck him, causing a wound.
11:20:38/So the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with ashes on his face.
11:20:39/As the king passed by, he cried out to the king: "Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man. If he is missing, your life will be taken for his life, or you will pay a talent of silver.'
11:20:40/While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared." The king of Israel said to him, "That is your verdict; you have decided it yourself."
11:20:41/He quickly removed the ashes from his face, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
11:20:42/He said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because you have let go of a man I had determined should die, your life will be taken for his life, and your people for his people.'"
11:20:43/And the king of Israel went to his palace, sullen and angry, and arrived in Samaria.
11:21:1/After these events, Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard in Jezreel, right next to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.
11:21:2/Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have your vineyard to use as a herb garden, since it's so close to my house. I'll give you a better vineyard in exchange, or if you prefer, I'll pay you its value in money."
11:21:3/But Naboth told Ahab, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors."
11:21:4/Ahab returned to his house, upset and angry because of Naboth the Jezreelite's refusal to give him the inheritance of his ancestors. He lay on his bed, turned his face away, and refused to eat.
11:21:5/Jezebel, his wife, came to him and asked, "Why are you so upset that you're not eating?"
11:21:6/He told her, "I asked Naboth the Jezreelite to sell me his vineyard for money, or if he preferred, I would give him another vineyard in exchange. But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
11:21:7/Jezebel, his wife, said to him, "Aren't you the ruler of Israel? Get up, eat something, and cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11:21:8/So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city.
11:21:9/In the letters, she wrote, "Declare a fast and place Naboth in a prominent position among the people."
11:21:10/Then appoint two scoundrels to accuse him, saying, 'You blasphemed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death."
11:21:11/The elders and nobles of Naboth's city did as Jezebel had instructed in the letters she had sent them.
11:21:12/They declared a fast and placed Naboth in a prominent position among the people.
11:21:13/Two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him, and they accused Naboth in front of the people, saying, "Naboth blasphemed God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
11:21:14/Then they sent word to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."
11:21:15/When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to sell to you. Naboth is no longer alive, but dead."
11:21:16/When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
11:21:17/And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
11:21:18/"Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. He's at the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it."
11:21:19/"Tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you murdered and also taken possession? This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked Naboth's blood, dogs will lick your blood, yes, yours.'"
11:21:20/Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, my enemy?" Elijah answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD."
11:21:21/"I'm going to bring disaster on you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel, both slave and free."
11:21:22/"I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have angered me and led Israel into sin."
11:21:23/And about Jezebel, the LORD also said, "Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel."
11:21:24/"Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds."
11:21:25/But there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do what was evil in the LORD's sight, urged on by his wife Jezebel.
11:21:26/He acted most detestably in following idols, just as the Amorites had, whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites.
11:21:27/When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, fasted, lay in sackcloth, and walked around meekly.
11:21:28/And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
11:21:29/"Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his time. But in his son's time, I will bring the disaster on his house."
11:22:1/And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
11:22:2/In the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah visited the king of Israel.
11:22:3/The king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you realize that Ramoth in Gilead belongs to us, yet we do nothing to take it back from the king of Syria?"
11:22:4/He then asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you join me in battle at Ramothgilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I stand with you, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
11:22:5/Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please seek the LORD's guidance today."
11:22:6/So the king of Israel gathered about four hundred prophets and asked them, "Should I go to war against Ramothgilead, or should I hold back?" They answered, "Go ahead, for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
11:22:7/Then Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"
11:22:8/The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, "There is one more man, Micaiah son of Imlah, through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I dislike him because he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad." Jehoshaphat said, "The king should not say such things."
11:22:9/So the king of Israel called for Micaiah son of Imlah to be brought quickly.
11:22:10/The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
11:22:11/Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made iron horns and declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"
11:22:12/All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, "Attack Ramothgilead and be victorious, for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
11:22:13/The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the other prophets are unanimously predicting success for the king. Please let your word be in agreement with theirs and speak favorably."
11:22:14/But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I will say only what the LORD tells me to."
11:22:15/When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramothgilead, or should we refrain?" He answered, "Go ahead, you will be successful, for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
11:22:16/Then the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
11:22:17/Micaiah replied, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no leader. Let them go home in peace.'"
11:22:18/The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad?"
11:22:19/Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven standing around him, on his right and on his left.
11:22:20/And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab to attack Ramothgilead and fall there?' One suggested this, and another that.
11:22:21/Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, 'I will entice him.'
11:22:22/'How?' the LORD asked. The spirit replied, 'I will go and become a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.'
11:22:23/So now, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has decreed disaster for you."
11:22:24/But Zedekiah son of Chenaanah approached, struck Micaiah on the cheek, and asked, "How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"
11:22:25/Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go into an inner room to hide."
11:22:26/Then the king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,
11:22:27/and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.'"
11:22:28/Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me. Listen, everyone, to what I have said."
11:22:29/So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
11:22:30/The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.
11:22:31/But the king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Fight only with the king of Israel, not with anyone else, great or small."
11:22:32/When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel," and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out.
11:22:33/When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
11:22:34/But a random arrow shot by an archer struck the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. He told his chariot driver, "Turn around and get me out of the battle; I've been wounded."
11:22:35/The battle intensified that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians. He died in the evening, and the blood from his wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
11:22:36/As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town, every man to his land!"
11:22:37/So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.
11:22:38/Someone washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared.
11:22:39/The rest of the deeds of Ahab, all he did, the ivory house he built, and all the cities he constructed, are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel, aren't they?
11:22:40/Ahab rested with his ancestors, and Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
11:22:41/Jehoshaphat son of Asa began his reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
11:22:42/Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
11:22:43/He followed all the ways of his father Asa without turning away from them, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD. However, the high places were not removed, and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.
11:22:44/Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
11:22:45/The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, his power, how he waged war, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
11:22:46/He removed from the land the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained from the days of his father Asa.
11:22:47/At that time there was no king in Edom; a deputy ruled.
11:22:48/Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail because they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.
11:22:49/Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with yours," but Jehoshaphat refused.
11:22:50/Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
11:22:51/Ahaziah son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he ruled over Israel for two years.
11:22:52/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the ways of his father, his mother, and Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin.
11:22:53/He served and worshiped Baal, angering the LORD, the God of Israel, just as his father had done.
12:1:1/Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
12:1:2/And Ahaziah fell through a lattice in his upper room in Samaria, and was injured: he sent messengers, saying, "Go, ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, if I will recover from this illness."
12:1:3/But the angel of the LORD told Elijah the Tishbite, "Get up, go to meet the king of Samaria's messengers, and ask them, 'Isn't it because there's no God in Israel that you're asking Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?'"
12:1:4/"So, this is what the LORD says: 'You won't leave the bed you're lying on; you will definitely die.'" And Elijah left.
12:1:5/When the messengers returned to him, he asked, "Why have you come back so soon?"
12:1:6/They replied, "A man came to meet us and said, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Isn't it because there's no God in Israel that you're sending to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, you won't leave the bed you're on; you will definitely die.'"'"
12:1:7/He asked them, "What did the man who met you and told you this look like?"
12:1:8/They answered, "He was a hairy man, wearing a leather belt around his waist." And he said, "That's Elijah the Tishbite."
12:1:9/Then the king sent a captain with his fifty men to Elijah. They found him sitting on top of a hill and said, "Man of God, the king orders you to come down."
12:1:10/Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
12:1:11/Again, the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men. He said to Elijah, "Man of God, the king demands you come down immediately."
12:1:12/Elijah answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." And God's fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
12:1:13/Once more, the king sent a captain of a third fifty with his fifty. This captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded, "Man of God, please value my life and the lives of these fifty men of yours."
12:1:14/"Look, fire came down from heaven and burned up the two previous captains and their fifties; so now, please let my life be valuable to you."
12:1:15/The angel of the LORD told Elijah, "Go down with him; don't be afraid of him." So he got up and went down with him to the king.
12:1:16/He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: 'Since you sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron—as if there's no God in Israel to inquire of—therefore, you won't leave the bed you're on; you will definitely die.'"
12:1:17/So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because Ahaziah had no son.
12:1:18/Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
12:2:1/It happened that when the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha left Gilgal together.
12:2:2/Elijah said to Elisha, "Please stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
12:2:3/The group of prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master away from you today?" He answered, "Yes, I know; be quiet."
12:2:4/Then Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please stay here; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.
12:2:5/The group of prophets at Jericho approached Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master away from you today?" He answered, "Yes, I know; be quiet."
12:2:6/Then Elijah said to him, "Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." But he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on.
12:2:7/Fifty men from the group of prophets went and stood at a distance, while Elijah and Elisha stood by the Jordan.
12:2:8/Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed on dry ground.
12:2:9/After they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" Elisha replied, "Please let me inherit a double portion of your spirit."
12:2:10/Elijah said, "You have asked for something difficult. Yet, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours—otherwise, it will not."
12:2:11/As they continued walking and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
12:2:12/When Elisha saw this, he cried out, "My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two.
12:2:13/He also picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back, standing by the bank of the Jordan.
12:2:14/He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, struck the water, and said, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over.
12:2:15/When the group of prophets from Jericho saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." They went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
12:2:16/They said to him, "Look, we have fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has lifted him up and thrown him onto some mountain or into some valley." But he said, "Do not send them."
12:2:17/However, they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." They sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.
12:2:18/When they returned to him (he was staying in Jericho), he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"
12:2:19/The people of the city said to Elisha, "Look, the location of this city is good, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the land is unproductive."
12:2:20/He said, "Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
12:2:21/Then he went out to the source of the water, threw the salt in it, and said, "This is what the LORD says: 'I have purified these waters; there will no longer be any death or unproductivity from them.'"
12:2:22/So the waters were purified to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.
12:2:23/From there he went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and mocked him, saying, "Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"
12:2:24/He turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
12:2:25/He then went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
12:3:1/Jehoram, Ahab's son, started his reign over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and ruled for twelve years.
12:3:2/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not to the extent of his father and mother, since he removed the Baal idol his father had set up.
12:3:3/However, he continued to follow the sinful practices of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin; he didn't turn away from them.
12:3:4/Mesha, the king of Moab, who was a major sheep breeder, paid the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
12:3:5/But after Ahab's death, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
12:3:6/King Jehoram left Samaria at that time and mustered all of Israel.
12:3:7/He then sent a message to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you join me in battle against Moab?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I'm in. Your people are my people, your horses are my horses."
12:3:8/He then asked, "Which route shall we attack from?" The response was, "Through the wilderness of Edom."
12:3:9/So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out. They took a roundabout route of seven days, but there was no water for the army or the animals that followed them.
12:3:10/The king of Israel exclaimed, "Oh no! The LORD has brought us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab!"
12:3:11/But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the LORD here through whom we can inquire of the LORD?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah."
12:3:12/Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.
12:3:13/Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." But the king of Israel said to him, "No, for the LORD has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab."
12:3:14/Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I wouldn't even look at you or notice you.
12:3:15/But now, bring me a musician." And when the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha.
12:3:16/He declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'Dig this valley full of ditches.'"
12:3:17/"For this is what the LORD says: 'You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle, and your other animals will drink.'"
12:3:18/"And this is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hands."
12:3:19/"You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs of water, and ruin every good field with stones."
12:3:20/And in the morning, at the time of the grain offering, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
12:3:21/When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come to fight against them, everyone who could bear arms, from the youngest to the oldest, was called up and stationed at the border.
12:3:22/They got up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, making it look red like blood to the Moabites.
12:3:23/They exclaimed, "That's blood! The kings must have fought and killed each other. Now, Moab, to the spoils!"
12:3:24/But when the Moabites came to the Israelite camp, the Israelites rose up and defeated the Moabites, who fled before them. They advanced, striking down the Moabites as they went.
12:3:25/They destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land until it was covered. They stopped all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. Only in Kirharaseth did they leave the stones in place; however, the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.
12:3:26/When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too intense for him, he took seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.
12:3:27/Then he took his eldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and sacrificed him as a burnt offering on the city wall. This caused great anger against Israel, and they withdrew and returned to their own land.
12:4:1/A woman, whose husband was one of the prophet's disciples, came to Elisha in distress. She said, "My husband, your servant, has passed away. You know he revered the LORD. Now, a creditor is coming to take my two sons as slaves."
12:4:2/Elisha asked her, "What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have at home?" She replied, "Your servant has nothing at home except a jar of oil."
12:4:3/He then said, "Go outside, borrow containers from all your neighbors, and make sure you get plenty of them."
12:4:4/"Once you're back inside, close the door behind you and your sons. Then pour oil into all the containers, setting aside the full ones."
12:4:5/She followed his instructions, closing the door behind her and her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she filled them.
12:4:6/When all the containers were full, she asked her son for another, but he said, "There are no more." Then the oil stopped flowing.
12:4:7/She reported back to the man of God, who said, "Go, sell the oil, pay off your debt, and you and your sons can live on what's left."
12:4:8/One day, Elisha went to Shunem, where a prominent woman lived. She insisted that he stay for a meal. From then on, whenever he passed by, he would stop there to eat.
12:4:9/She said to her husband, "I'm sure this man who keeps stopping by is a holy man of God."
12:4:10/"Let's build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, table, chair, and lamp, so he can stay with us whenever he comes."
12:4:11/One day, Elisha came and stayed in the room.
12:4:12/He asked his servant Gehazi to call the Shunammite woman. When she appeared before him,
12:4:13/he instructed Gehazi, "Tell her, 'You've gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Would you like us to speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I have my home among my people."
12:4:14/He asked, "What can we do for her?" Gehazi said, "Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old."
12:4:15/Elisha said, "Call her." So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.
12:4:16/"Next year, at this time, you will hold a son in your arms," he said. But she replied, "No, my lord, man of God, do not mislead your servant."
12:4:17/Yet the woman conceived and gave birth to a son the following year, just as Elisha had told her.
12:4:18/When the child grew older, he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.
12:4:19/He complained to his father, "My head, my head!" His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."
12:4:20/The servant carried him to his mother, and he sat on her lap until noon, then he died.
12:4:21/She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door, and left.
12:4:22/Then she called to her husband, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can quickly go to the man of God and return."
12:4:23/He asked, "Why are you going to him today? It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath." She said, "It will be alright."
12:4:24/She saddled the donkey and told her servant, "Hurry, don't slow down unless I tell you to."
12:4:25/So she went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When Elisha saw her coming, he said to Gehazi, "Look, there's the Shunammite woman.
12:4:26/"Run to meet her and ask, 'Are you alright? Is your husband alright? Is the child alright?'" She answered, "Everything is fine."
12:4:27/But when she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone, she is deeply troubled, and the LORD has hidden the reason from me."
12:4:28/She said, "Did I ask for a son, my lord? Didn't I tell you not to raise my hopes?"
12:4:29/Elisha then said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff, and go. If you meet anyone, don't greet them; if anyone greets you, don't answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face."
12:4:30/But the boy's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her.
12:4:31/Gehazi went ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So he went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy has not awakened."
12:4:32/When Elisha arrived at the house, he found the boy dead and lying on his bed.
12:4:33/He went in, closed the door on the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.
12:4:34/Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out on him, the boy's body grew warm.
12:4:35/Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room, then got on the bed and stretched out on him again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
12:4:36/Elisha called Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite woman." So he did. When she came, he said, "Pick up your son."
12:4:37/She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.
12:4:38/Elisha returned to Gilgal during a famine. The company of prophets was sitting before him, and he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for the prophets."
12:4:39/One of them went out to the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds, filling his cloak, and came back to shred them into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.
12:4:40/They served the stew for the men to eat, but as they began eating, they cried out, "Man of God, there's poison in the pot!" And they couldn't eat it.
12:4:41/Elisha said, "Bring some flour." He threw it into the pot and said, "Serve it to the people to eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
12:4:42/A man came from Baal-shalisha, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread and freshly ripened grain. Elisha said, "Give it to the people to eat."
12:4:43/His servant asked, "How can I set this before a hundred men?" But Elisha repeated, "Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says: 'They will eat and have some left over.'"
12:4:44/So he set it before them, and they ate and had leftovers, according to the word of the LORD.
12:5:1/Now Naaman, the commander of the Syrian king's army, was highly regarded by his master and honored because through him, the LORD had brought victory to Syria. He was also a brave warrior, but he had leprosy.
12:5:2/The Syrians had conducted raids and had taken a young girl from Israel captive; she served Naaman's wife.
12:5:3/She said to her mistress, "If only my master were with the prophet in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
12:5:4/Someone went and told his master, "This is what the girl from Israel has said."
12:5:5/The king of Syria said, "Go ahead, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So he left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
12:5:6/He delivered the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent my servant Naaman to you so you can cure him of his leprosy."
12:5:7/When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in distress and said, "Am I God, able to kill and bring to life, that this man sends someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a fight with me!"
12:5:8/When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel."
12:5:9/So Naaman arrived with his horses and chariot and stood at the door of Elisha's house.
12:5:10/Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan River seven times, and your skin will be restored, and you will be cleansed."
12:5:11/But Naaman became angry and left, saying, "I thought he would surely come out to me, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot, and cure the leprosy.
12:5:12/Aren't the Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and left in a rage.
12:5:13/His servants approached him and said, "Father, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, wouldn't you have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'?"
12:5:14/So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had instructed. His skin was restored like that of a young boy, and he was cleansed.
12:5:15/Then he returned to the man of God with all his entourage, stood before him, and declared, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant."
12:5:16/But Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.
12:5:17/Then Naaman said, "If not, please let your servant be given as much earth as two mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any god but the LORD.
12:5:18/However, may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there and leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this."
12:5:19/Elisha said to him, "Go in peace." So he left him a short distance away.
12:5:20/But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, "My master has let Naaman the Syrian off too easily by not accepting what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."
12:5:21/So Gehazi chased after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running towards him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, "Is everything alright?"
12:5:22/He replied, "Everything is fine. My master sent me to say, 'Just now two young men from the company of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"
12:5:23/Naaman said, "Please take two talents." He insisted, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing, and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
12:5:24/When he arrived at the tower, he took the items from their hands and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they left.
12:5:25/He then went in and stood before his master. Elisha asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" He answered, "Your servant didn't go anywhere."
12:5:26/But Elisha said to him, "Wasn't my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, oxen, male and female servants?
12:5:27/Therefore, Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and your descendants forever." And Gehazi left his presence leprous, as white as snow.
12:6:1/The students of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we're staying with you is too small for us.
12:6:2/Let's go to the Jordan River, and each of us can get a log to build a bigger place for us to live." And he said, "Go ahead."
12:6:3/One of them said, "Please, come with your servants." And he answered, "I'll come."
12:6:4/So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began to cut down trees.
12:6:5/But as one was cutting down a tree, the axe head fell into the water. He cried out, "Oh no, my master! It was borrowed!"
12:6:6/The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and the iron floated.
12:6:7/Then he said, "Pick it up." So he reached out his hand and took it.
12:6:8/The king of Syria was at war with Israel and discussed with his advisors, saying, "We will camp in such and such a place."
12:6:9/But the man of God sent a message to the king of Israel: "Be careful not to pass by this place, because the Syrians are heading there."
12:6:10/So the king of Israel checked the place the man of God had mentioned and warned him about, and he was careful to avoid it, not just once or twice.
12:6:11/This greatly upset the king of Syria. He called his officers and demanded, "Won't you tell me which of us is siding with the king of Israel?"
12:6:12/One of his officers said, "No, my lord, the king. It's Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your bedroom."
12:6:13/He said, "Go and find out where he is, so I can send people to capture him." They reported, "He's in Dothan."
12:6:14/So he sent horses, chariots, and a large army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the city.
12:6:15/When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out, he saw an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. The servant said to him, "Oh no, my master! What are we going to do?"
12:6:16/He answered, "Don't be afraid. Those who are with us outnumber those who are with them."
12:6:17/Then Elisha prayed, "LORD, please open his eyes so he can see." And the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
12:6:18/As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Strike these people with blindness." And He struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
12:6:19/Elisha told them, "This isn't the right way or the right city. Follow me, and I'll lead you to the man you're looking for." But he led them to Samaria.
12:6:20/When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see." The LORD opened their eyes, and they realized they were inside Samaria.
12:6:21/When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Should I kill them, my father? Should I kill them?"
12:6:22/He answered, "Don't kill them. Would you kill those you've captured with your own sword or bow? Give them food and water so they can eat and drink, and then let them return to their master."
12:6:23/So he prepared a big feast for them, and after they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. After that, the Syrian raiders stopped invading Israel's territory.
12:6:24/Afterward, Benhadad king of Syria mobilized his entire army and besieged Samaria.
12:6:25/There was a severe famine in Samaria, and they besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a quarter of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
12:6:26/As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, "Help, my lord, O king!"
12:6:27/He said, "If the LORD doesn't help you, how can I? Can I offer help from the threshing floor or the winepress?"
12:6:28/The king asked her, "What's wrong?" She replied, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we can eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.'"
12:6:29/So we cooked my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, 'Give up your son so we can eat him,' but she has hidden her son."
12:6:30/When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. As he walked along the wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth on his body underneath.
12:6:31/He said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today."
12:6:32/But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head? When the messenger comes, close the door and hold it shut against him. Isn't the sound of his master's footsteps behind him?"
12:6:33/While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
12:7:1/Then Elisha said, "Listen to the word of the LORD; This is what the LORD says, 'Tomorrow at this time, a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.'"
12:7:2/Then an official on whom the king relied answered the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD were to open windows in heaven, could this happen?" And he said, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."
12:7:3/There were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the gate, and they said to each other, "Why are we sitting here until we die?"
12:7:4/"If we decide to go into the city, the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will also die. So let's go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die."
12:7:5/So they got up at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they reached the edge of the Syrian camp, to their surprise, no one was there.
12:7:6/For the LORD had caused the Syrian army to hear the sound of chariots and horses, the sound of a great army, so they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us."
12:7:7/So they got up and fled in the twilight, leaving their tents, horses, and donkeys behind, and the camp as it was, running for their lives.
12:7:8/When these lepers reached the edge of the camp, they entered one tent, ate and drank, and took silver, gold, and clothes, and went and hid them. Then they came back, entered another tent, took things from it, and went and hid them too.
12:7:9/Then they said to each other, "We're not doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we're keeping silent. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let's go and report this to the royal palace."
12:7:10/So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, "We went to the Syrian camp, and there was no one there, no human voice, only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were."
12:7:11/The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the king's palace.
12:7:12/The king got up in the night and said to his servants, "Let me tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know we're starving, so they've left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we'll capture them alive and then enter the city.'"
12:7:13/One of his servants suggested, "Please, let some men take five of the remaining horses in the city. They're like all the multitude of Israel that's left here. Let's send them to see what's happened."
12:7:14/So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the Syrian army, saying, "Go and see."
12:7:15/They followed them to the Jordan River, and found the whole way littered with clothes and equipment the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. The messengers returned and reported to the king.
12:7:16/Then the people went out and plundered the Syrian camp. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, just as the LORD had said.
12:7:17/The king had put the official who had doubted the word of the LORD in charge of the gate, but the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to him.
12:7:18/It happened just as the man of God had told the king, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be available tomorrow at this time at the gate of Samaria."
12:7:19/And the official had answered the man of God, "Even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could such a thing happen?" And he had said, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."
12:7:20/And that's exactly what happened to him: the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
12:8:1/Then Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had brought back to life, saying, "Get up, take your family, and find a place to stay wherever you can, because the LORD has announced a famine that will last seven years."
12:8:2/And the woman got up and did as the man of God instructed. She and her family moved to the land of the Philistines and lived there for seven years.
12:8:3/At the end of the seven years, the woman came back from the land of the Philistines. She went to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
12:8:4/And the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, asking, "Please tell me about all the remarkable things Elisha has done."
12:8:5/While he was telling the king how he had brought a dead person back to life, the woman whose son he had brought back to life came to the king to plead for her house and her land. Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life."
12:8:6/When the king asked the woman about it, she told him. So the king assigned an official to her case, saying, "Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left until now."
12:8:7/And Elisha went to Damascus; Benhadad, the king of Syria, was ill; and it was reported to him, saying, "The man of God has arrived here."
12:8:8/And the king said to Hazael, "Take a gift in your hand, go meet the man of God, and ask the LORD through him, saying, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
12:8:9/So Hazael went to meet him, taking a gift with him, all kinds of good things from Damascus, enough for forty camels, and stood before him, saying, "Your son Benhadad, king of Syria, has sent me to you, asking, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
12:8:10/And Elisha told him, "Go, tell him, 'You will definitely recover.' However, the LORD has shown me that he will certainly die."
12:8:11/And he stared at him fixedly until he was embarrassed, and then the man of God began to cry.
12:8:12/And Hazael asked, "Why is my lord crying?" He answered, "Because I know the harm you will do to the children of Israel: you will set their fortresses on fire, kill their young men with the sword, smash their children, and cut open their pregnant women."
12:8:13/And Hazael said, "But what, am I a dog, that I would do such a terrible thing?" And Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you will become king over Syria."
12:8:14/So he left Elisha and returned to his master, who asked him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And he replied, "He told me you would surely recover."
12:8:15/But the next day, he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water, and spread it over his face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place.
12:8:16/In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab king of Israel, while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, began to reign.
12:8:17/He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
12:8:18/He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, because he married a daughter of Ahab. He did what was evil in the LORD's sight.
12:8:19/Yet the LORD did not want to destroy Judah, for the sake of David His servant, as He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.
12:8:20/During his reign, Edom rebelled against Judah's authority and set up their own king.
12:8:21/So Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. He set out at night and defeated the Edomites who had surrounded him, along with the commanders of his chariots. Then his army fled back to their tents.
12:8:22/But Edom continued to rebel against Judah's authority to this day. At the same time, Libnah also rebelled.
12:8:23/The rest of the events of Joram's reign, and all he did, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
12:8:24/And Joram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
12:8:25/In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah, son of Jehoram king of Judah, began to reign.
12:8:26/Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
12:8:27/He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as the house of Ahab had done, because he was related by marriage to the house of Ahab.
12:8:28/He joined Joram son of Ahab in a war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, where the Syrians wounded Joram.
12:8:29/King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah during his battle with Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah, son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was ill.
12:9:1/Elisha the prophet called one of the young prophets and said to him, "Get ready, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramothgilead.
12:9:2/When you arrive there, find Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in, have him stand up from among his brothers, and take him to a private room.
12:9:3/Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, 'This is what the LORD says: I have anointed you king over Israel.' Then open the door, run away, and don't stop.
12:9:4/So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
12:9:5/When he arrived, he found the army commanders sitting together. He said, "I have a message for you, commander." Jehu asked, "For which one of us?" He replied, "For you, commander."
12:9:6/Jehu stood up and went into the house. The young prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and told him, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have anointed you king over the LORD's people, Israel.
12:9:7/You are to destroy the house of Ahab, your master, so I can avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the LORD's servants, shed by Jezebel.
12:9:8/The entire house of Ahab will perish: I will eliminate every male in Ahab's line, whether free or slave in Israel.
12:9:9/I will make Ahab's house like the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah.
12:9:10/The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury her." Then he opened the door and ran away.
12:9:11/Then Jehu went out to his master's servants. They asked him, "Is everything alright? Why did this crazy man come to you?" He replied, "You know the man and his talk."
12:9:12/They said, "That's not true; tell us now." Jehu said, "He told me this and that, saying, 'This is what the LORD says: I have anointed you king over Israel.'"
12:9:13/They quickly took their cloaks, spread them under him on the bare steps, blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, "Jehu is king."
12:9:14/So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, plotted against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramothgilead against Hazael, king of Syria,
12:9:15/But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Syrians had inflicted on him during the battle with Hazael, king of Syria.) Jehu said, "If you are with me, don't let anyone escape from the city to go and warn Jezreel."
12:9:16/So Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel, where Joram was resting. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to visit Joram.
12:9:17/A lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching and announced, "I see a group." Joram ordered, "Send a horseman to meet them and ask, 'Is it peace?'"
12:9:18/So a horseman went to meet Jehu and said, "The king asks, 'Is it peace?'" Jehu replied, "What do you care about peace? Fall in behind me." The lookout reported, "The messenger reached them, but he's not coming back."
12:9:19/Then Joram sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, "The king asks, 'Is it peace?'" Jehu answered, "What do you care about peace? Fall in behind me."
12:9:20/The lookout reported, "He reached them, but he's not coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu, the son of Nimshi—he drives furiously."
12:9:21/Joram said, "Get ready." They prepared his chariot. Then Joram, king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, rode out, each in his chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of land belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite.
12:9:22/When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is it peace, Jehu?" Jehu replied, "How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?"
12:9:23/Joram turned to flee and cried out to Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!"
12:9:24/Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
12:9:25/Then Jehu said to Bidkar, his officer, "Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together behind Ahab, his father, when the LORD pronounced this judgment on him:
12:9:26/'Yesterday, I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,' says the LORD, 'and I will repay you on this plot of land,' says the LORD. Now, pick him up and throw him onto the plot, according to the word of the LORD."
12:9:27/But when Ahaziah, king of Judah, saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed him, shouting, "Hit him too, in the chariot." They did so at the ascent of Gur, near Ibleam. Ahaziah managed to reach Megiddo but died there.
12:9:28/His servants drove him in his chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the city of David.
12:9:29/In the eleventh year of Joram, son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
12:9:30/When Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it. She put on makeup, fixed her hair, and looked out of a window.
12:9:31/As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, "Did Zimri have peace after killing his master?"
12:9:32/He looked up at the window and shouted, "Who's on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
12:9:33/He said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down, and her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her underfoot.
12:9:34/After he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, "Take care of this cursed woman and bury her, for she was a king's daughter."
12:9:35/But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, feet, and the palms of her hands.
12:9:36/So they went back and told Jehu. He said, "This fulfills the word of the LORD, which he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: 'In the plot of Jezreel, dogs will eat Jezebel's flesh.
12:9:37/Jezebel's body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, 'This is Jezebel.'"
12:10:1/Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the leaders of Jezreel, the elders, and those responsible for raising Ahab's children, saying,
12:10:2/As soon as you receive this letter, given that your master's sons are with you, along with chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons;
12:10:3/Select the best and most suitable of your master's sons, place him on his father's throne, and defend your master's dynasty.
12:10:4/But they were extremely afraid and said, "Two kings couldn't stand against him; how can we?"
12:10:5/The household manager, the city manager, the elders, and the caretakers of the children sent a message to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants and will do everything you tell us; we won't appoint any king. Do what you think is best."
12:10:6/Then he sent them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side and will listen to me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." The king's sons, seventy in number, were with the city's leading men, who had raised them.
12:10:7/When the letter arrived, they killed the king's sons, all seventy of them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
12:10:8/A messenger arrived and told him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." He said, "Stack them in two piles at the entrance of the gate until morning."
12:10:9/In the morning, he went out, stood before all the people, and said, "You are innocent. I plotted against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?
12:10:10/Know now that not a single word the LORD has spoken about the house of Ahab will fail; the LORD has done what he promised through his servant Elijah."
12:10:11/So Jehu killed everyone remaining from the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his leading men, relatives, and priests, leaving him no survivors.
12:10:12/Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, at the shearing house,
12:10:13/Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah, and asked, "Who are you?" They answered, "We are Ahaziah's relatives; we're going to greet the children of the king and the queen."
12:10:14/He said, "Capture them alive." They captured them alive and then killed them at the pit of the shearing house, forty-two men; he didn't spare any of them.
12:10:15/After leaving there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him and said, "Is your heart as true to mine as mine is to yours?" Jehonadab answered, "It is." "If so, give me your hand." So he gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot with him.
12:10:16/He said, "Join me and see my zeal for the LORD." So he had him ride in his chariot.
12:10:17/When he arrived in Samaria, he killed all who remained of Ahab's family in Samaria, eradicating them according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah.
12:10:18/Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much more.
12:10:19/Now, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; make sure no one is missing. I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who doesn't show up will not live." But Jehu was acting with cunning to destroy the worshippers of Baal.
12:10:20/Jehu said, "Declare a solemn assembly for Baal." And they announced it.
12:10:21/Jehu sent a message throughout all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came; not a single one stayed behind. They entered the temple of Baal, filling it from one end to the other.
12:10:22/He told the one in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal." So he brought out robes for them.
12:10:23/Jehu, along with Jehonadab son of Rechab, went into the temple of Baal and said to the worshippers of Baal, "Make sure there are no servants of the LORD here with you, only worshippers of Baal."
12:10:24/As they were making sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu stationed eighty men outside and said, "If any of the men I am entrusting to you escapes, it will be your life for his life."
12:10:25/As soon as he finished making the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and the captains, "Go in and kill them; let no one escape." So they struck them down with the sword; the guards and the captains threw the bodies out and then entered the inner temple of Baal.
12:10:26/They brought out the sacred pillars from the temple of Baal and burned them.
12:10:27/They demolished the sacred pillar of Baal, tore down the temple of Baal, and turned it into a latrine, which it remains to this day.
12:10:28/In this way, Jehu eradicated Baal worship from Israel.
12:10:29/However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin—the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.
12:10:30/The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
12:10:31/But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart; he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which led Israel into sin.
12:10:32/In those days, the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel;
12:10:33/From the Jordan River eastward, all the land of Gilead—the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites—from Aroer by the Arnon River through Gilead to Bashan.
12:10:34/The rest of the acts of Jehu, all he did, and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
12:10:35/Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king.
12:10:36/Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years.
12:11:1/When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, realized her son was dead, she got up and eliminated all the royal family members.
12:11:2/But Jehosheba, King Joram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, took Joash, Ahaziah's son, and secretly took him away from the king’s sons who were being killed; she and his nurse hid him in a bedroom, saving him from Athaliah, so he was not killed.
12:11:3/He stayed hidden with her in the LORD's temple for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
12:11:4/In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the captains, and the guards, bringing them into the LORD's temple. He made a covenant with them, swore them to secrecy in the LORD's temple, and revealed the king's son to them.
12:11:5/He instructed them, saying, "Here's what you need to do: one third of you coming in on the Sabbath will guard the king's palace;
12:11:6/Another third will be at the Sur gate, and the last third at the gate behind the guards. This way, you'll ensure the palace is securely guarded.
12:11:7/Two thirds of you who go out on the Sabbath will guard the LORD's temple to protect the king.
12:11:8/You must surround the king, each of you armed; anyone who approaches must be killed. Stay close to the king, whether he's leaving or returning.
12:11:9/The commanders of units of a hundred did everything Jehoiada the priest ordered. They brought their men, those coming in and those going out on the Sabbath, to Jehoiada the priest.
12:11:10/Jehoiada gave the commanders King David's spears and shields that were stored in the LORD's temple.
12:11:11/The guards stood, each with his weapon, surrounding the king, from the right side to the left side of the temple, near the altar and inside the temple.
12:11:12/They brought out the king's son, crowned him, handed him the royal decree, and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, applauded, and shouted, "Long live the king!"
12:11:13/When Athaliah heard the sound of the guards and the crowd, she approached the crowd at the LORD's temple.
12:11:14/Upon seeing the king standing by a pillar, as was the custom, with princes and trumpeters beside him, and all the people of the land celebrating and blowing trumpets, Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, "Treason! Treason!"
12:11:15/Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of hundreds, the army officers, to bring her out beyond the temple grounds and to kill with the sword anyone who followed her. He had declared, "She must not be killed inside the LORD's temple."
12:11:16/They seized her, and she was taken by the same path the horses used to enter the king's palace, where she was killed.
12:11:17/Jehoiada then established a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD's people, as well as a covenant between the king and the people.
12:11:18/All the people went to the temple of Baal and demolished it. They smashed his altars and images completely and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. The priest then appointed officials over the LORD's temple.
12:11:19/He took the commanders of hundreds, the captains, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they escorted the king from the LORD's temple, through the guards' gate to the royal palace, where he took his seat on the throne.
12:11:20/All the people of the land celebrated, and the city was peaceful. Athaliah was executed beside the royal palace.
12:11:21/Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
12:12:1/In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; he ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah from Beersheba.
12:12:2/Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD throughout his reign, as long as he was guided by Jehoiada the priest.
12:12:3/However, the high places were not removed: people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
12:12:4/Jehoash told the priests, "All the money from the sacred donations that is brought into the temple of the LORD, including the census money, the personal redemption money, and any voluntary donations,
12:12:5/let the priests take it for themselves, each from his own donors, and use it to repair any damage found in the temple."
12:12:6/Yet, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash's reign, the priests had not repaired the temple.
12:12:7/So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests, and asked them, "Why haven't you repaired the temple? Stop taking money from your donors and hand it over for the temple repairs."
12:12:8/The priests agreed to no longer take money from the people and not to be responsible for the temple repairs.
12:12:9/But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, drilled a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the LORD. The doorkeepers put all the money brought into the temple of the LORD into it.
12:12:10/Whenever they noticed a large amount of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would come, bag the money, and count it.
12:12:11/Then they handed over the counted money to those in charge of the temple work, who paid the carpenters and builders working on the temple of the LORD,
12:12:12/as well as to the masons and stonecutters, and to purchase timber and cut stone to repair the temple of the LORD, and for any other expenses related to the repairs.
12:12:13/However, they did not make silver bowls, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or any gold or silver vessels with the money brought into the temple of the LORD;
12:12:14/instead, they used it to pay the workers and repair the temple of the LORD.
12:12:15/They did not require an accounting from the men to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, because they acted with integrity.
12:12:16/The money for guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.
12:12:17/Then Hazael, king of Syria, attacked and captured Gath, and then turned to attack Jerusalem.
12:12:18/Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the sacred objects dedicated by his ancestors—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, kings of Judah—and his own sacred objects, along with all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and sent them to Hazael, king of Syria, who then withdrew from Jerusalem.
12:12:19/The rest of the events of Joash's reign, including all he did, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah.
12:12:20/Some of his officials conspired against him and assassinated him at the House of Millo, on the road to Silla.
12:12:21/Jozachar, son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of Shomer, his officials, struck him down, and he died. He was buried with his ancestors in the City of David, and Amaziah, his son, succeeded him as king.
12:13:1/In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to rule over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for seventeen years.
12:13:2/He did what was wrong in the eyes of the LORD, following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin; he did not turn away from them.
12:13:3/The LORD became angry with Israel and handed them over to Hazael king of Syria, and to Benhadad the son of Hazael, throughout their reign.
12:13:4/Jehoahaz pleaded with the LORD, and the LORD listened to him because he saw how severely Israel was oppressed by the king of Syria.
12:13:5/The LORD provided a deliverer for Israel, so they escaped from the Syrians' control, and the people of Israel lived in their homes as they had before.
12:13:6/However, they did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam's family, which led Israel into sin; they continued in those sins, and the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.
12:13:7/The king of Syria left Jehoahaz with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers because he had decimated them, making them like dust at threshing.
12:13:8/The rest of the events of Jehoahaz's reign, all he did, and his displays of power are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12:13:9/Jehoahaz passed away and was buried in Samaria; and Joash his son succeeded him as king.
12:13:10/In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to rule over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for sixteen years.
12:13:11/He did what was wrong in the eyes of the LORD; he did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin; he continued in those sins.
12:13:12/The rest of the events of Joash's reign, all he did, and his displays of power, especially his battles against Amaziah king of Judah, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12:13:13/Joash passed away and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam took his place on the throne.
12:13:14/Now Elisha had become ill with the illness that would lead to his death. King Joash of Israel visited him, wept over him, and said, "My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!"
12:13:15/Elisha told him, "Grab a bow and some arrows." And he grabbed a bow and arrows.
12:13:16/He instructed the king of Israel, "Place your hand on the bow." He did so, and Elisha placed his hands on the king's hands.
12:13:17/Then he said, "Open the east window." He opened it. Elisha said, "Shoot," and he shot. Elisha declared, "This is the LORD's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria. You will defeat the Syrians at Aphek until you have destroyed them."
12:13:18/He then said, "Take the arrows," and he took them. Elisha told the king of Israel, "Strike the ground." He struck the ground three times and stopped.
12:13:19/The man of God became angry with him and said, "You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Syria completely. Now, you will defeat Syria only three times."
12:13:20/Elisha died and was buried. Moabite raiders invaded the land at the start of the year.
12:13:21/As some people were burying a man, they saw a band of raiders and threw the man's body into Elisha's tomb. When the body touched Elisha's bones, the man came back to life and stood up on his feet.
12:13:22/But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
12:13:23/Yet the LORD was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and showed them favor because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not want to destroy them or cast them from his presence just yet.
12:13:24/So Hazael king of Syria died, and Benhadad his son succeeded him as king.
12:13:25/Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities that had been taken from his father Jehoahaz through war. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
12:14:1/In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah began his reign.
12:14:2/He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
12:14:3/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his ancestor David had done: he followed all the practices of his father Joash.
12:14:4/However, the high places were not removed: the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.
12:14:5/As soon as he felt secure in his reign, he executed the officials who had assassinated his father the king.
12:14:6/But he did not put to death the children of the assassins, in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children for their parents; each will die for their own sin."
12:14:7/He killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Selah by war, renaming it Joktheel, a name it has held to this day.
12:14:8/Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, with a challenge: "Come, let's face each other in battle."
12:14:9/But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah with a parable: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild animal in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
12:14:10/You have indeed defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home. Why ask for trouble and provoke your own downfall and that of Judah as well?"
12:14:11/But Amaziah refused to listen. So Jehoash king of Israel advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
12:14:12/And Judah was defeated by Israel; every man fled to his tent.
12:14:13/Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. He then advanced to Jerusalem and broke down its wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a distance of 400 cubits.
12:14:14/He took all the gold and silver, all the articles found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace, along with hostages, and returned to Samaria.
12:14:15/The rest of the events of Jehoash's reign, his achievements, and his battles with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12:14:16/Jehoash rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son Jeroboam succeeded him as king.
12:14:17/Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
12:14:18/The rest of the events of Amaziah's reign, are they not recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:14:19/They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
12:14:20/They brought him back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David.
12:14:21/All the people of Judah then took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
12:14:22/He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after the king rested with his ancestors.
12:14:23/In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and he ruled for forty-one years.
12:14:24/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin.
12:14:25/He restored the boundaries of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, in accordance with the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, spoken through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.
12:14:26/For the LORD saw how bitterly everyone in Israel, whether slave or free, was suffering; there was no one to help them.
12:14:27/And the LORD did not say he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but he saved them through Jeroboam son of Joash.
12:14:28/The rest of the events of Jeroboam's reign, all he did, his power, how he waged war, and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath for Israel, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12:14:29/Jeroboam rested with his ancestors, the kings of Israel. His son Zechariah succeeded him as king.
12:15:1/In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
12:15:2/He was sixteen years old when he started his reign, and he ruled for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
12:15:3/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, following everything his father Amaziah had done;
12:15:4/However, the high places were not taken down: the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
12:15:5/The LORD struck the king with leprosy until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house. Jotham, the king's son, took charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
12:15:6/The rest of the events of Azariah's reign, and everything he did, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:15:7/So Azariah rested with his ancestors; they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David, and Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
12:15:8/In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zachariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria for six months.
12:15:9/He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his ancestors had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin.
12:15:10/Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against him, assassinated him in public, killed him, and took his place as king.
12:15:11/The rest of the events of Zachariah's reign are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
12:15:12/This fulfilled the word of the LORD spoken to Jehu, saying, "Your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." And so it happened.
12:15:13/Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned for one month in Samaria.
12:15:14/Menahem son of Gadi came from Tirzah to Samaria, attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, killed him, and succeeded him as king.
12:15:15/The rest of the events of Shallum's reign, including his conspiracy, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
12:15:16/Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah and everyone in it, as well as its surrounding territories from Tirzah because they did not open their gates to him. He attacked it and ripped open all the pregnant women.
12:15:17/In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for ten years in Samaria.
12:15:18/He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD. Throughout his life, he never turned away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin.
12:15:19/Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver to gain his support and strengthen his own hold on the kingdom.
12:15:20/Menahem imposed a tax on Israel, extracting fifty shekels of silver from each wealthy man to pay the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and did not stay in the land.
12:15:21/The rest of the events of Menahem's reign, and everything he did, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
12:15:22/And Menahem rested with his ancestors, and Pekahiah his son succeeded him as king.
12:15:23/In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for two years.
12:15:24/He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, not turning away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin.
12:15:25/But Pekah son of Remaliah, one of his officers, conspired against him. He struck him down in Samaria, in the royal palace, along with Argob and Arieh and fifty men of the Gileadites. He killed him and took his place as king.
12:15:26/The rest of the events of Pekahiah's reign, and everything he did, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
12:15:27/In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for twenty years.
12:15:28/He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, not turning away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin.
12:15:29/During the reign of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglathpileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abelbethmaachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali, and deported the people to Assyria.
12:15:30/Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah, assassinated him, and succeeded him as king in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
12:15:31/The rest of the events of Pekah's reign, and everything he did, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
12:15:32/In the second year of Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign.
12:15:33/He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok.
12:15:34/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, following everything his father Uzziah had done.
12:15:35/However, the high places were not removed: the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
12:15:36/The rest of the events of Jotham's reign, and everything he did, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:15:37/During those days, the LORD began to send Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
12:15:38/And Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
12:16:1/In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
12:16:2/Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. Unlike his ancestor David, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
12:16:3/Instead, he followed the practices of the kings of Israel, even sacrificing his son in the fire, imitating the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
12:16:4/He also offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
12:16:5/Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel advanced to Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz but were unable to conquer him.
12:16:6/At that time, Rezin king of Syria regained Elath for Syria, expelling the Jews from Elath. The Syrians then moved into Elath and have lived there ever since.
12:16:7/So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the king of Syria and the king of Israel who are attacking me."
12:16:8/Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the temple of the LORD and in the royal treasury and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
12:16:9/The king of Assyria responded to his request. He attacked Damascus, captured it, deported its inhabitants to Kir, and killed Rezin.
12:16:10/When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, he saw an altar in Damascus. King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a model of the altar and detailed plans for its construction.
12:16:11/Urijah the priest built an altar according to all the specifications King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Urijah finished it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.
12:16:12/When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings on it.
12:16:13/He offered his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.
12:16:14/He also relocated the bronze altar that was before the LORD from the front of the temple, from between the new altar and the temple of the LORD, and placed it on the north side of the new altar.
12:16:15/King Ahaz instructed Urijah the priest, "On the large altar, offer the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king's burnt sacrifice and his grain offering, along with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings. Sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifices. The bronze altar will be for my personal use."
12:16:16/Urijah the priest did everything King Ahaz commanded.
12:16:17/King Ahaz removed the panels from the bases and removed the basin from them. He took down the Sea from the bronze bulls that supported it and placed it on a stone pavement.
12:16:18/He also removed the Sabbath canopy that had been built at the temple and the royal entrance outside the temple of the LORD, in deference to the king of Assyria.
12:16:19/Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:16:20/And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
12:17:1/In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah began his reign in Samaria over Israel, lasting nine years.
12:17:2/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not to the extent of the previous kings of Israel.
12:17:3/Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, attacked him; Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute.
12:17:4/The king of Assyria discovered Hoshea's betrayal because he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and hadn't brought the annual tribute to the king of Assyria. As a result, the king of Assyria imprisoned him.
12:17:5/Then the king of Assyria invaded the entire land, approached Samaria, and laid siege to it for three years.
12:17:6/In the ninth year of Hoshea's reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria, settling them in Halah, in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
12:17:7/This happened because the Israelites sinned against the LORD their God, who had freed them from Egypt, from under the control of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and they worshiped other gods.
12:17:8/They followed the practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before them, as well as the customs the kings of Israel had introduced.
12:17:9/The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. They built high places in all their towns, from watchtowers to fortified cities.
12:17:10/They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
12:17:11/There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations the LORD had driven out before them. They did wicked things that provoked the LORD to anger.
12:17:12/They worshiped idols, despite the LORD having told them, "You must not do this."
12:17:13/Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers: "Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets."
12:17:14/But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their ancestors, who did not trust in the LORD their God.
12:17:15/They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors and the warnings he had given them. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless, imitating the nations around them, despite the LORD's command not to do so.
12:17:16/They forsook all the commands of the LORD their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts, and they worshiped Baal.
12:17:17/They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sought omens and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, arousing his anger.
12:17:18/So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left.
12:17:19/But even Judah did not keep the commands of the LORD their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced.
12:17:20/Therefore the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel. He afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers, until he thrust them from his presence.
12:17:21/When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin.
12:17:22/The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them
12:17:23/until the LORD removed Israel from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria, where they are to this day.
12:17:24/The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns.
12:17:25/When they first lived there, they did not worship the LORD; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people.
12:17:26/It was reported to the king of Assyria: "The nations you have deported and settled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of the country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires."
12:17:27/Then the king of Assyria gave this order: "Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires."
12:17:28/So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the LORD.
12:17:29/Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places.
12:17:30/The Babylonians made Sukkoth Benoth, the people of Cuth made Nergal, and the people of Hamath made Ashima.
12:17:31/The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
12:17:32/Even while these people were worshiping the LORD, they appointed all sorts of people to officiate for them as priests at the high places.
12:17:33/They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.
12:17:34/To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the LORD nor adhere to the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
12:17:35/With whom the LORD had made a covenant and commanded them: "Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them.
12:17:36/But the LORD, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and an outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices.
12:17:37/You must always be careful to keep the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.
12:17:38/Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods.
12:17:39/Rather, worship the LORD your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."
12:17:40/However, they would not listen, instead they practiced their former customs.
12:17:41/So these nations feared the LORD and also served their carved images; their children likewise, and their children's children—as their ancestors did, so they do to this day.
12:18:1/In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz king of Judah, began his reign.
12:18:2/He was twenty-five years old when he started his reign and ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
12:18:3/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, following everything David his ancestor had done.
12:18:4/He got rid of the high places, smashed the idols, cut down the sacred poles, and destroyed the bronze serpent Moses had made, because up until then, the Israelites had been burning incense to it. He called it Nehushtan.
12:18:5/He put his trust in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after him.
12:18:6/He remained loyal to the LORD and did not stop following him; he kept the commands the LORD had given Moses.
12:18:7/The LORD was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
12:18:8/He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
12:18:9/In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.
12:18:10/After three years, they captured it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured.
12:18:11/The king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
12:18:12/Because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD their God but violated his covenant—all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded—they neither listened nor obeyed.
12:18:13/In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
12:18:14/Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand." The king of Assyria demanded from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
12:18:15/So Hezekiah gave him all the silver found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
12:18:16/At that time, Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the pillars he had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria.
12:18:17/The king of Assyria sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish with a large army to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the launderer's field.
12:18:18/When they called for the king, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came out to them.
12:18:19/Rabshakeh said to them, "Tell Hezekiah, 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what basis are you placing your confidence?
12:18:20/You claim to have strategy and military strength, but these are mere words. On whom are you depending, that you have rebelled against me?
12:18:21/Look, you are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
12:18:22/But if you say to me, 'We are depending on the LORD our God,' isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?
12:18:23/Now then, I urge you to pledge allegiance to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
12:18:24/How can you repel one of the least of my master's officials, even relying on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
12:18:25/Have I come to attack and destroy this place without the LORD's direction? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it."
12:18:26/Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."
12:18:27/But Rabshakeh replied, "Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?"
12:18:28/Then Rabshakeh stood and called out in Hebrew, "Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:
12:18:29/This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.
12:18:30/Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD by saying, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
12:18:31/Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,
12:18:32/until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey. Choose life and not death! Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you by saying, 'The LORD will deliver us.'
12:18:33/Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
12:18:34/Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
12:18:35/Who among all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
12:18:36/But the people remained silent and did not answer him a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
12:18:37/Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
12:19:1/When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went into the temple of the LORD.
12:19:2/He sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
12:19:3/They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; it's like when children are about to be born, but there's no strength to deliver them.
12:19:4/Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to insult the living God, and will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, pray for the surviving remnant."
12:19:5/So King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah.
12:19:6/Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
12:19:7/Look, I will send a spirit upon him, and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.'"
12:19:8/So the field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, because he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
12:19:9/When he heard reports about Tirhakah king of Cush saying, "He has come out to fight against you," he sent messengers again to Hezekiah with this message:
12:19:10/"Tell Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
12:19:11/You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
12:19:12/Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the nations such as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
12:19:13/Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"
12:19:14/Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
12:19:15/And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: "LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
12:19:16/LORD, bend down your ear and hear; open, LORD, your eyes and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
12:19:17/It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste the nations and their lands
12:19:18/And have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. So they destroyed them.
12:19:19/Now, LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, LORD, are God."
12:19:20/Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
12:19:21/This is the word the LORD has spoken against him: 'The Virgin Daughter Zion despises you and mocks you. The Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
12:19:22/Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
12:19:23/Through your messengers you have insulted the LORD, and you have said, "With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I will cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I will reach its remotest parts, the finest of its forests.
12:19:24/I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet, I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt."
12:19:25/Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
12:19:26/Their inhabitants, powerless, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
12:19:27/But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
12:19:28/Because of your rage against me and your arrogance, which I have heard, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.'
12:19:29/This will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and in the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
12:19:30/The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
12:19:31/For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.
12:19:32/Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
12:19:33/By the way he came, by the same he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the LORD.
12:19:34/I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant."
12:19:35/That night, the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!
12:19:36/So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
12:19:37/One day, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
12:20:1/In those days, Hezekiah was seriously ill and near death. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, visited him and said, "This is what the LORD says: Get your affairs in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."
12:20:2/Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying,
12:20:3/"Please, LORD, remember how I have lived faithfully and wholeheartedly before you, and have done what is right in your eyes." And Hezekiah cried bitterly.
12:20:4/Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
12:20:5/"Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. Look, I will heal you. On the third day from now, you will go up to the temple of the LORD.
12:20:6/I will add fifteen years to your life. I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria's hand. I will protect this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.'"
12:20:7/Then Isaiah said, "Prepare a poultice of figs." They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.
12:20:8/Hezekiah asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the LORD on the third day?"
12:20:9/Isaiah replied, "This will be the sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do what he has promised: Will the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?"
12:20:10/Hezekiah answered, "It's easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. Rather, let it go back ten steps."
12:20:11/Then Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD, and the LORD made the shadow go back ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
12:20:12/At that time, Berodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about Hezekiah's illness.
12:20:13/Hezekiah listened to them and showed them all his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oil—his armory, and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
12:20:14/Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a distant country, from Babylon."
12:20:15/Isaiah asked, "What have they seen in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything in my palace. There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."
12:20:16/Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to the word of the LORD.
12:20:17/The time will come when everything in your palace, and all that your ancestors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
12:20:18/Some of your own descendants, your offspring, will be taken away and will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
12:20:19/Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD you have spoken is good." He thought, "Isn't it good if there will be peace and security in my lifetime?"
12:20:20/The rest of the events of Hezekiah's reign, his power, and how he made the pool and the canal to bring water into the city, are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah.
12:20:21/Hezekiah rested with his ancestors, and Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
12:21:1/Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
12:21:2/He did what was evil in the LORD's eyes, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
12:21:3/He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole as Ahab king of Israel had done, worshipped all the celestial bodies, and served them.
12:21:4/He built altars in the temple of the LORD, even though the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem, I will put my name."
12:21:5/He constructed altars for all the celestial bodies in the two courtyards of the LORD's temple.
12:21:6/He made his son pass through fire, practiced divination, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did a great deal of evil in the LORD's sight, provoking him to anger.
12:21:7/He placed a carved idol of the Asherah pole he had made inside the temple, about which the LORD had told David and his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever."
12:21:8/I will not make Israel's feet wander anymore from the land I gave their ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I have commanded them and will follow the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them.
12:21:9/But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
12:21:10/And the LORD spoke through his servants the prophets, saying,
12:21:11/"Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable acts, doing more evil than all the Amorites before him and leading Judah into sin with his idols,
12:21:12/Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
12:21:13/I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
12:21:14/I will abandon the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over to their enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their foes,
12:21:15/because they have done evil in my eyes and have provoked me to anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this day."
12:21:16/Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end, in addition to leading Judah to sin by doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
12:21:17/Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, all he did, and the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:21:18/And Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
12:21:19/Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
12:21:20/He did what was evil in the LORD's eyes, just as his father Manasseh had done.
12:21:21/He followed all the ways his father had walked in, served the idols his father had served, and worshipped them.
12:21:22/He abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
12:21:23/Amon's servants conspired against him and assassinated the king in his own palace.
12:21:24/But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
12:21:25/Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:21:26/And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son succeeded him as king.
12:22:1/Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah from Boscath.
12:22:2/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, followed the path of his ancestor David without deviating to the right or the left.
12:22:3/In the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam, who was a scribe, to the temple of the LORD with a message,
12:22:4/"Go to Hilkiah the high priest so he can total up the silver that has been brought into the temple of the LORD, which the gatekeepers have collected from the people.
12:22:5/Let them hand it over to the supervisors of the temple work, so they can pay the workers who are repairing the temple,
12:22:6/To the carpenters, builders, and masons, and to purchase timber and cut stone to fix the temple."
12:22:7/However, they did not require an accounting from those who were given the money to pay the workers, because they acted with integrity.
12:22:8/Hilkiah the high priest told Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who read it.
12:22:9/Shaphan the scribe went to the king, reported back, and said, "Your servants have collected the money found in the temple and have given it to the supervisors of the temple work."
12:22:10/Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it in front of the king.
12:22:11/When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes in distress.
12:22:12/The king ordered Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah, a servant of the king, saying,
12:22:13/"Go and inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all of Judah about the contents of this book that has been found. The LORD's anger must be burning against us because our ancestors did not listen to the words of this book and did not live according to all that is written about us."
12:22:14/So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asahiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; she lived in Jerusalem in the Second District, and they spoke with her.
12:22:15/She told them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,
12:22:16/'This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its inhabitants—all the curses written in the book that was read before the king of Judah—
12:22:17/Because they have abandoned me and burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore, my wrath will be ignited against this place and will not be extinguished.'"
12:22:18/"But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, tell him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Regarding the words you heard,
12:22:19/Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its inhabitants—that they would become a desolation and a curse—and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.
12:22:20/Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'" And they brought the message back to the king.
12:23:1/The king sent out a call, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him.
12:23:2/The king, along with all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both young and old, went up to the temple of the LORD. There, he read aloud all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the temple.
12:23:3/The king stood by a pillar and pledged before the LORD to follow the LORD, to keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all their heart and soul, and to carry out the words of the covenant written in the book. All the people affirmed the covenant.
12:23:4/The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the second-order priests, and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the items made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the celestial bodies. He then burned them outside Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley and took their ashes to Bethel.
12:23:5/He removed the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem, as well as those who burned incense to Baal, the sun, the moon, the constellations, and all the heavenly host.
12:23:6/He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem, burned it there, crushed it to dust, and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.
12:23:7/He tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of the LORD, where women did weaving for Asherah.
12:23:8/He brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and defiled the high places where they had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the high places at the gates, including the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the city governor, which was on the left as one enters the city.
12:23:9/However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
12:23:10/He desecrated Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to make their son or daughter pass through the fire to Molech.
12:23:11/He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, near the chamber of Nathan-Melech the official, which was in the precincts. He also burned the chariots of the sun.
12:23:12/He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof of Ahaz's upper chamber, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the LORD. He smashed them to pieces and threw their rubble into the Kidron Valley.
12:23:13/The king defiled the high places east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Milcom the detestable god of the Ammonites.
12:23:14/He smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles, filling their places with human bones.
12:23:15/He also tore down the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. He burned the high place, ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole.
12:23:16/As Josiah turned, he noticed the tombs on the hillside. He had the bones removed from the tombs and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these events.
12:23:17/Then he asked, "What is that monument I see?" The people of the city told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done."
12:23:18/He said, "Leave it alone; do not let anyone disturb his bones." So they spared his bones, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
12:23:19/Josiah also removed all the shrines at the high places in the cities of Samaria that the kings of Israel had built to provoke the LORD to anger. He did to them just as he had done in Bethel.
12:23:20/He executed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
12:23:21/The king commanded all the people, "Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God as it is prescribed in this covenant book."
12:23:22/Indeed, no such Passover had been observed since the days of the judges who led Israel, nor during the entire period of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.
12:23:23/But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem.
12:23:24/Josiah also got rid of the mediums, the spiritists, the household gods, the idols, and all the detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This was to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the temple of the LORD.
12:23:25/There was no king like him before or after him who turned to the LORD with all his heart, soul, and strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.
12:23:26/Yet, the LORD did not turn away from the heat of His fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke Him.
12:23:27/The LORD said, "I will also remove Judah from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and the temple about which I said, 'My Name shall be there.'"
12:23:28/The rest of the events of Josiah's reign, and all he did, are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah.
12:23:29/During his reign, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to confront him, but Necho killed him at Megiddo as soon as he saw him.
12:23:30/His servants transported his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land then took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
12:23:31/Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
12:23:32/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his ancestors had done.
12:23:33/Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath to prevent him from ruling in Jerusalem, and imposed a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold on the land.
12:23:34/Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, changed his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away. He died in Egypt.
12:23:35/Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold to Pharaoh but taxed the land to meet Pharaoh's demand, extracting the silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to their wealth, to give to Pharaoh Necho.
12:23:36/Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
12:23:37/He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his ancestors had done.
12:24:1/During his reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years before he rebelled against him.
12:24:2/And the LORD sent against him groups of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, as the LORD had declared through his prophets.
12:24:3/Indeed, by the LORD's command, this disaster came upon Judah to remove them from his presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all he had done;
12:24:4/And also because of the innocent blood he spilled, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the LORD would not forgive.
12:24:5/The rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, and everything he did, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:24:6/So Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king.
12:24:7/The king of Egypt did not invade the land again because the king of Babylon had taken control of all the territory from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates, which belonged to the king of Egypt.
12:24:8/Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
12:24:9/And he did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as his father had done.
12:24:10/At that time, the forces of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem, and the city was under siege.
12:24:11/Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon himself came against the city while his forces besieged it.
12:24:12/Jehoiachin the king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon, along with his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officials. The king of Babylon captured him in the eighth year of his reign.
12:24:13/He took from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace, and destroyed all the gold objects that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had foretold.
12:24:14/He took into exile all of Jerusalem, all the officials, all the military men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. Only the poorest people of the land were left.
12:24:15/He took Jehoiachin to Babylon along with the king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land, he took them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
12:24:16/And all the men of valor, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all strong and fit for war, were taken captive to Babylon by the king of Babylon.
12:24:17/The king of Babylon appointed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, as king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
12:24:18/Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
12:24:19/And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
12:24:20/Because of the LORD's anger, it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah that he expelled them from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
12:25:1/In the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon arrived with his entire army to besiege Jerusalem. They surrounded it and built siege works against it.
12:25:2/The city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
12:25:3/By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine had become severe in the city, and there was no food for the people.
12:25:4/The city's defenses were breached, and all the soldiers fled at night through a gate between two walls near the king's garden, while the Babylonians surrounded the city. The king escaped towards the plains.
12:25:5/The Babylonian army chased the king and caught up with him in the plains of Jericho, and his army was scattered from him.
12:25:6/They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they passed sentence on him.
12:25:7/They killed Zedekiah's sons in front of him, then blinded him, shackled him with bronze fetters, and took him to Babylon.
12:25:8/On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard and servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
12:25:9/He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every significant building was burned down.
12:25:10/The entire Babylonian army under the captain of the guard demolished the walls around Jerusalem.
12:25:11/Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported the remaining people in the city, those who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the population.
12:25:12/But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to work as vineyard keepers and farmers.
12:25:13/The Babylonians broke into pieces the bronze pillars, the movable stands, and the bronze sea in the temple of the LORD, and carried the bronze to Babylon.
12:25:14/They took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in temple service.
12:25:15/The firepans and bowls that were gold or silver were also taken away by the captain of the guard.
12:25:16/The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands that Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD—the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.
12:25:17/One pillar was eighteen cubits high, and its bronze capital was three cubits high, decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The second pillar was similar, with a network.
12:25:18/The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
12:25:19/He also took an official who was in charge of the soldiers, five royal advisers who were found in the city, the chief military recruiter, and sixty men from the populace who were found in the city.
12:25:20/Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
12:25:21/And the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was exiled from its land.
12:25:22/Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over the people he had left behind in Judah.
12:25:23/When all the army commanders and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. This included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Careah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maachathite, along with their men.
12:25:24/Gedaliah assured them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Stay in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
12:25:25/But in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah, along with the Jews and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.
12:25:26/Then all the people, both small and great, along with the army commanders, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.
12:25:27/In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year he began to reign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.
12:25:28/He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
12:25:29/He changed Jehoiachin's prison clothes, and Jehoiachin dined regularly at the king's table for the rest of his life.
12:25:30/The king gave Jehoiachin a daily allowance for the rest of his life.

13:9:18/Who until now waited at the king’s gate on the east side: they were gatekeepers in the groups of the children of Levi.
13:9:19/And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, from his family, the Korahites, were in charge of the service work, guardians of the gates of the tabernacle: and their ancestors, in charge of the camp of the LORD, were guardians of the entrance.
13:9:20/And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was their leader in the past, and the LORD was with him.
13:9:21/And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
13:9:22/All those chosen to be gatekeepers at the gates numbered two hundred and twelve. They were recorded by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer appointed to their trusted positions.
13:9:23/So they and their children were in charge of the gates of the house of the LORD, the house of the tent, by shifts.
13:9:24/The gatekeepers were stationed on the four sides: east, west, north, and south.
13:9:25/And their relatives in their villages were required to come periodically, every seven days, to be with them.
13:9:26/For the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God.
13:9:27/And they stayed around the house of God because the responsibility was theirs, and they had to open it every morning.
13:9:28/And some of them were in charge of the serving vessels, for they were required to bring them in and out by count.
13:9:29/Some were appointed to take care of the vessels, all the instruments of the sanctuary, the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the incense, and the spices.
13:9:30/And some of the priests' sons mixed the spice ointment.
13:9:31/And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of preparing the offerings baked in pans.
13:9:32/And some of their brothers, from the sons of the Kohathites, were in charge of preparing the showbread every Sabbath.
13:9:33/And these are the singers, leaders among the fathers of the Levites, who stayed in the rooms and were exempt from other duties because they were engaged in their work day and night.
13:9:34/These leaders of the fathers among the Levites were chiefs throughout their generations; they lived in Jerusalem.
13:9:35/And in Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s name was Maachah:
13:9:36/And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab.
13:9:37/And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

13:9:42/And Ahaz fathered Jarah; and Jarah fathered Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri fathered Moza;
13:9:43/And Moza fathered Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
13:9:44/And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.
13:10:1/The Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled from them and were killed on Mount Gilboa.
13:10:2/The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons, killing Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons.
13:10:3/The battle was fierce against Saul, and archers hit him, causing severe injuries.
13:10:4/Saul then told his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me with it; I don't want these uncircumcised men to come and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer was too scared to do it. So, Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
13:10:5/Seeing that Saul was dead, his armor-bearer also killed himself with his sword.
13:10:6/Thus, Saul, his three sons, and his entire household died together.
13:10:7/When the Israelites in the valley saw that their army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and ran away. The Philistines then moved in and occupied them.
13:10:8/The next day, when the Philistines came to loot the bodies, they found Saul and his sons dead on Mount Gilboa.
13:10:9/After stripping him, they took his head and armor, and sent them throughout Philistine territory to proclaim the news to their idols and people.
13:10:10/They placed his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
13:10:11/When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
13:10:12/All the brave men set out, retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons, brought them back to Jabesh, and buried their bones under an oak in Jabesh, then fasted for seven days.
13:10:13/Saul died because of his unfaithfulness to the LORD, for not obeying the LORD's command, and also for consulting a medium for guidance,
13:10:14/Instead of seeking guidance from the LORD. Therefore, the LORD killed him and transferred the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.
13:11:1/Then all Israel came together to David in Hebron, saying, "Look, we are your own flesh and blood.
13:11:2/And even before, when Saul was king, you were the one leading Israel in and out; and the LORD your God told you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will be the leader over my people Israel.'
13:11:3/So all the elders of Israel came to the king in Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had declared through Samuel.
13:11:4/David and all Israel then went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land, were.
13:11:5/And the people of Jebus told David, 'You will not enter here.' Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, now known as the City of David.
13:11:6/David announced, 'Whoever strikes the Jebusites first will become the leader and commander.' So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became the leader.
13:11:7/David lived in the fortress; therefore, it was called the City of David.
13:11:8/He expanded the city all around, from the Millo and around, and Joab rebuilt the rest of the city.
13:11:9/Thus, David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.
13:11:10/These are also the leaders of the mighty warriors who were with David, who strengthened their support for him in his kingdom, along with all Israel, to make him king, according to the LORD's word concerning Israel.
13:11:11/Here is the list of the mighty warriors David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the leader of the officers: he wielded his spear against three hundred killed by him at one time.
13:11:12/Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty warriors.
13:11:13/He was with David at Pasdammim, where the Philistines had gathered for battle. There was a field full of barley, and the people fled from the Philistines.
13:11:14/But they took a stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and defeated the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory.
13:11:15/Now three of the thirty leaders went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam, while the Philistine army camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
13:11:16/At that time, David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
13:11:17/David expressed a longing, saying, "If only someone would get me a drink of water from the well by the gate of Bethlehem!"
13:11:18/So the three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and carried it back to David. But David refused to drink it and instead poured it out as an offering to the LORD.
13:11:19/He said, "God forbid that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, he refused to drink it. Such were the deeds of the three mightiest warriors.
13:11:20/And Abishai, Joab's brother, was the leader of the three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and became famous among the three.
13:11:21/Among the three, he was more honored than the other two and became their commander, but he did not attain the rank of the first three.
13:11:22/Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a brave man from Kabzeel, performed great deeds. He struck down two of Moab's best warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
13:11:23/He killed an impressive Egyptian, who was five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod, Benaiah went down to him with a club, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
13:11:24/These are the deeds of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who earned a reputation among the three mighty warriors.
13:11:25/He was distinguished among the thirty, but he did not reach the rank of the first three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
13:11:26/Also among the valiant warriors were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
13:11:27/Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
13:11:28/Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,
13:11:29/Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
13:11:30/Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
13:11:31/Ithai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
13:11:32/Hurai from the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
13:11:33/Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
13:11:34/The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
13:11:35/Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
13:11:36/Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
13:11:37/Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
13:11:38/Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,
13:11:39/Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
13:11:40/Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
13:11:41/Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
13:11:42/Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
13:11:43/Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
13:11:44/Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,
13:11:45/Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
13:11:46/Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
13:11:47/Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
13:12:1/Now these are the people who came to David in Ziklag, while he was still hiding because of Saul, the son of Kish. They were among the elite warriors, aiding in the battle.
13:12:2/They were skilled with bows, able to use both the right and left hand for slinging stones and shooting arrows from a bow, including those from Saul’s own tribe of Benjamin.
13:12:3/The leader was Ahiezer, followed by Joash, the sons of Shemaah from Gibeath; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; along with Berachah, and Jehu from Anathoth.
13:12:4/And Ismaiah from Gibeon, a standout among the thirty, leading them; and Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Josabad from Gederah,
13:12:5/Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph,
13:12:6/Elkanah, Jesiah, Azareel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,
13:12:7/And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
13:12:8/From the Gadites, some separated themselves to join David in the wilderness stronghold, warriors ready for battle, skilled with shield and spear, with faces like lions and as swift as gazelles on the mountains;
13:12:9/Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
13:12:10/Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
13:12:11/Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
13:12:12/Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
13:12:13/Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
13:12:14/These were from the sons of Gad, leaders of the army: the least could lead a hundred, and the greatest, a thousand.
13:12:15/They crossed the Jordan in the first month when it overflowed all its banks; they chased away all the valley dwellers, to the east and to the west.
13:12:16/And members from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to join David.
13:12:17/David went out to meet them and said, "If you've come in peace to assist me, my heart will join with yours. But if you're here to betray me to my enemies, even though I've done no wrong, may the God of our ancestors see it and judge."
13:12:18/Then the spirit came upon Amasai, the leader of the captains, and he said, "We are yours, David, and with you, son of Jesse. Peace, peace to you, and peace to your allies; for your God assists you." Then David welcomed them and made them leaders of his troops.
13:12:19/Some from Manasseh defected to David when he was going with the Philistines to fight against Saul. But they didn't help the Philistines because, after consultation, the Philistine lords sent him away, saying, "He might defect to his master Saul at the cost of our heads."
13:12:20/As he went to Ziklag, men from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zilthai, leaders of thousands in Manasseh.
13:12:21/They helped David against raiding bands, for they were all mighty warriors and commanders in the army.
13:12:22/Day by day, more came to help David until he had a great army, like God's own army.
13:12:23/These are the numbers of the warriors ready for battle who came to David in Hebron to transfer Saul’s kingdom to him, as the LORD had commanded.
13:12:24/The men of Judah carrying shield and spear numbered 6,800, ready for battle.
13:12:25/From the tribe of Simeon, 7,100 mighty warriors ready for battle.
13:12:26/From the Levites, 4,600.
13:12:27/And Jehoiada, leader of the Aaronites, with 3,700,
13:12:28/And Zadok, a young warrior, with 22 captains from his family.
13:12:29/From Benjamin, Saul’s tribe, 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul’s house until then.
13:12:30/From Ephraim, 20,800 mighty warriors, famous in their own clans.
13:12:31/From the half-tribe of Manasseh, 18,000, designated by name to come and make David king.
13:12:32/From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, 200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command.
13:12:33/From Zebulun, 50,000 experienced soldiers, equipped for battle with all types of weapons, ready to assist with undivided loyalty.
13:12:34/From Naphtali, 1,000 commanders, with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears.
13:12:35/From Dan, 28,600 men ready for battle.
13:12:36/From Asher, 40,000 experienced soldiers ready for battle.
13:12:37/From across the Jordan, from the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 120,000 men equipped with all kinds of weapons for battle.
13:12:38/All these warriors, ready for battle, came to Hebron with a unified purpose to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of Israel was of one mind to make David king.
13:12:39/They stayed with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their relatives had prepared for them.
13:12:40/Moreover, those nearby, from as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—provisions of flour, fig cakes, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel.
13:13:1/And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
13:13:2/And David said to the entire assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if it's in line with the will of the LORD our God, let's reach out to our brothers everywhere who are left in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites in their towns and surrounding areas, so they can join us.
13:13:3/And let's bring the ark of our God back to us: for we didn't consult it during Saul's time.
13:13:4/And the whole assembly agreed to do so, for the idea was well received by everyone.
13:13:5/So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor River in Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
13:13:6/And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim, whose name is invoked over it.
13:13:7/And they transported the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
13:13:8/And David and all Israel celebrated before God with all their might, with singing, and with harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
13:13:9/And when they reached the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
13:13:10/And the LORD's anger burned against Uzza, and He struck him down because he touched the ark; and there he died before God.
13:13:11/And David was upset because the LORD had struck Uzza; that's why that place is called Perez Uzza to this day.
13:13:12/And David was afraid of God that day, thinking, "How can I bring the ark of God to my home?"
13:13:13/So David did not take the ark to his own city, but diverted it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
13:13:14/And the ark of God stayed with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months. And the LORD blessed Obed-Edom's household and everything he had.
13:14:1/Now Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
13:14:2/And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, because of his people Israel.
13:14:3/And David took more wives in Jerusalem: and David had more sons and daughters.
13:14:4/Now these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
13:14:5/And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
13:14:6/And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
13:14:7/And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
13:14:8/And when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it, and went out to confront them.
13:14:9/And the Philistines came and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
13:14:10/And David asked God, saying, "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up; for I will hand them over to you."
13:14:11/So they went up to Baalperazim; and David defeated them there. Then David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a flood." Therefore, they named that place Baalperazim.
13:14:12/And when they left their gods there, David ordered them to be burned.
13:14:13/And the Philistines spread out again in the valley.
13:14:14/Therefore, David asked God again; and God told him, "Do not go up after them; circle around them, and attack them near the mulberry trees."
13:14:15/And it shall be, when you hear the sound of movement in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall go out to battle: for God has gone out before you to strike down the Philistine army.
13:14:16/David therefore did as God had commanded him: and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gazer.
13:14:17/And David's fame spread throughout all lands; and the LORD made all nations fear him.
13:15:1/David built houses in the city of David, prepared a place for the ark of God, and set up a tent for it.
13:15:2/Then David declared that only the Levites should carry the ark of God because the LORD had chosen them for this task and to serve Him forever.
13:15:3/David brought all of Israel together in Jerusalem to move the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
13:15:4/And David gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
13:15:5/From the Kohathites, Uriel was the leader, with 120 of his relatives.
13:15:6/From the Merarites, Asaiah was the leader, with 220 of his relatives.
13:15:7/From the Gershonites, Joel was the leader, with 130 of his relatives.
13:15:8/From the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah was the leader, with 200 of his relatives.
13:15:9/From the Hebronites, Eliel was the leader, with 80 of his relatives.
13:15:10/From the Uzzielites, Amminadab was the leader, with 112 of his relatives.
13:15:11/David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
13:15:12/And told them, "You are the leaders of the Levite families. Purify yourselves and your relatives so you can bring the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it."
13:15:13/Because we didn't do it correctly the first time, the LORD our God punished us since we didn't consult Him properly.
13:15:14/So the priests and Levites purified themselves to transport the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
13:15:15/The Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had instructed according to the LORD's command.
13:15:16/David instructed the Levite leaders to appoint musicians to play instruments like lyres, harps, and cymbals, and to sing joyfully.
13:15:17/The Levites appointed Heman, son of Joel; Asaph, son of Berechiah; and from the Merarites, Ethan, son of Kushaiah;
13:15:18/Along with their second-tier relatives: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
13:15:19/So the musicians, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were assigned to play the bronze cymbals;
13:15:20/And Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played lyres tuned to Alamoth;
13:15:21/And Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, Jeiel, and Azaziah played harps tuned to Sheminith to lead the music.
13:15:22/Chenaniah, the lead Levite in music, directed the music because he was skilled.
13:15:23/Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.
13:15:24/And Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethaneel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, played the trumpets before the ark of God, and Obededom and Jehiah were gatekeepers for the ark.
13:15:25/So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Obededom's house with joy.
13:15:26/When God helped the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
13:15:27/David wore a robe of fine linen, as did all the Levites carrying the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah, the music director. David also wore a linen ephod.
13:15:28/Thus, all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and loud music from lyres and harps.
13:15:29/As the ark of the covenant of the LORD arrived in the city of David, Michal, daughter of Saul, watched from a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating. She felt contempt for him in her heart.
13:16:1/So they brought the ark of God and placed it in the center of the tent that David had set up for it. They then offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
13:16:2/After David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
13:16:3/He distributed to every person in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a generous portion of meat, and a container of wine.
13:16:4/He assigned some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the LORD, to keep records, and to express gratitude and praise to the LORD God of Israel.
13:16:5/Asaph was the leader, followed by Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obededom. Jeiel played the psalteries and harps, while Asaph played the cymbals.
13:16:6/Benaiah and Jahaziel, the priests, played trumpets continuously before the ark of the covenant of God.
13:16:7/On that day, David first handed over this psalm to thank the LORD to Asaph and his brothers.
13:16:8/Express gratitude to the LORD, call on his name, and share his deeds with the people.
13:16:9/Sing to him, sing hymns to him, and discuss all his amazing works.
13:16:10/Take pride in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD be joyful.
13:16:11/Search for the LORD and his strength, constantly seek his presence.
13:16:12/Remember the incredible works he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced.
13:16:13/You descendants of Israel, his servants, children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
13:16:14/He is the LORD our God; his judgments are found throughout the earth.
13:16:15/Always remember his covenant, the promise he made for a thousand generations.
13:16:16/This includes the covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac.
13:16:17/He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
13:16:18/He said, "I will give you the land of Canaan as your inherited possession."
13:16:19/When you were few in number, just a handful, and strangers in the land.
13:16:20/As they moved from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people.
13:16:21/He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake, he rebuked kings.
13:16:22/Saying, "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
13:16:23/Sing to the LORD, all the earth; day by day, proclaim his salvation.
13:16:24/Share his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all peoples.
13:16:25/For the LORD is great and highly to be praised; he is to be revered above all gods.
13:16:26/For all the gods of the peoples are mere idols, but the LORD created the heavens.
13:16:27/Majesty and splendor are before him; strength and joy are in his dwelling place.
13:16:28/Give to the LORD, families of the peoples, give to the LORD glory and strength.
13:16:29/Give to the LORD the glory due to his name; bring an offering, and come before him; worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness.
13:16:30/Revere him, all the earth; the world also will be stable, not to be shaken.
13:16:31/Let the heavens be joyful, and let the earth be glad; let it be known among the nations, "The LORD reigns."
13:16:32/Let the sea and everything in it roar; let the fields and everything in them rejoice.
13:16:33/Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
13:16:34/Express gratitude to the LORD, for he is good; his steadfast love endures forever.
13:16:35/And say, "Save us, O God of our salvation, gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise."
13:16:36/Blessed be the LORD God of Israel forever and ever. And all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD.
13:16:37/So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister before the ark regularly, according to each day's requirements.
13:16:38/And Obededom with their sixty-eight brothers; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be gatekeepers.
13:16:39/And Zadok the priest, and his priestly brothers, before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place that was at Gibeon,
13:16:40/To offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, and to do everything that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel.
13:16:41/And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen and specifically named, to give thanks to the LORD, because his steadfast love endures forever.
13:16:42/And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.
13:16:43/And all the people went to their homes, and David returned to bless his household.
13:17:1/One day, as David was sitting in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Look, I live in a house made of cedar, but the ark of God's covenant is under a tent."
13:17:2/Then Nathan replied to David, "Go ahead and do what's in your heart, because God is with you."
13:17:3/That very night, God spoke to Nathan, saying,
13:17:4/"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: You are not to build me a house to live in.
13:17:5/Since the day I brought Israel up until now, I have not lived in a house but have moved from tent to tent, and from one dwelling place to another.
13:17:6/Wherever I have traveled with all Israel, did I ever ask any of the leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people, "Why haven't you built me a house of cedar?"'
13:17:7/Now, this is what you are to tell my servant David: 'The LORD of hosts says, I took you from tending sheep to be ruler over my people Israel.
13:17:8/I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have eliminated all your enemies before you. I will make you as famous as the greatest people on earth.
13:17:9/I will designate a place for my people Israel and will plant them so they can live in their own place without being disturbed anymore. The wicked will not oppress them anymore as they did at the beginning,
13:17:10/And since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.
13:17:11/When your time comes and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom.
13:17:12/He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will secure his throne forever.
13:17:13/I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him as I took it away from your predecessor.
13:17:14/But I will place him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.'"
13:17:15/Following all these words and this entire vision, Nathan spoke to David.
13:17:16/Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
13:17:17/And as if this was not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of your servant's family for a long time and have looked on me as someone of high rank, O LORD God.
13:17:18/What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? You know your servant.
13:17:19/O LORD, for your servant's sake and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness and revealed all these great things.
13:17:20/O LORD, there is no one like you, nor is there any God besides you, according to everything we have heard with our ears.
13:17:21/And what nation on earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem as his own people, making yourself a name of great and awesome deeds, by driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt?
13:17:22/You made your people Israel your own forever, and you, LORD, became their God.
13:17:23/So now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever, and do as you have said.
13:17:24/Let it be established so that your name will be exalted forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, and the house of David your servant is established before you.'
13:17:25/For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore, your servant has found courage to pray before you.
13:17:26/And now, LORD, you are God, and you have promised this goodness to your servant.
13:17:27/Now, please bless the house of your servant so that it may continue before you forever. For you, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.
13:18:1/After this, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and captured Gath and its surrounding towns from the Philistines.
13:18:2/He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David's subjects, bringing him gifts.
13:18:3/David defeated Hadarezer, king of Zobah, near Hamath, as he was establishing his rule up to the Euphrates River.
13:18:4/David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David crippled all the chariot horses but kept a hundred chariots.
13:18:5/When the Syrians from Damascus came to support Hadarezer, king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand Syrian men.
13:18:6/Then David placed military garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became David's subjects, bringing him gifts. Thus, the LORD protected David wherever he went.
13:18:7/David seized the gold shields carried by Hadarezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
13:18:8/Also, from Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David acquired a great amount of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze sea, pillars, and bronze articles.
13:18:9/When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadarezer, king of Zobah;
13:18:10/He sent his son Hadoram to King David to ask about his well-being and to congratulate him for his victory over Hadarezer, since Hadarezer had been at war with Tou. He brought with him all kinds of items made of gold, silver, and bronze.
13:18:11/David dedicated these items to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations: Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
13:18:12/Furthermore, Abishai, son of Zeruiah, killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13:18:13/He placed military garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's subjects. Thus, the LORD protected David wherever he went.
13:18:14/So David ruled over all Israel, administering justice and fairness to all his people.
13:18:15/Joab, son of Zeruiah, was in charge of the army; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the recorder.
13:18:16/Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Abimelech, son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was the secretary; 
13:18:17/Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were key advisors to the king.
13:19:1/After this event, Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, passed away, and his son succeeded him as king.
13:19:2/David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun, Nahash's son, because his father was kind to me." So, David sent messengers to comfort him about his father's death. David's servants arrived in Ammonite territory to console Hanun.
13:19:3/However, the Ammonite princes said to Hanun, "Do you really think David is honoring your father by sending these comforters? Aren't his servants here to scout, overthrow, and spy on our land?"
13:19:4/So, Hanun took David's servants, shaved them, cut their clothes at the buttocks, and sent them away humiliated.
13:19:5/Some people went and informed David about how the men were treated. David sent someone to meet them because they were deeply embarrassed. He told them, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, then return."
13:19:6/Seeing they had angered David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Syriamaachah, and Zobah.
13:19:7/They managed to hire thirty-two thousand chariots, along with the king of Maachah and his troops, who camped before Medeba. The Ammonites also rallied from their cities for the battle.
13:19:8/When David heard about it, he dispatched Joab with all his elite warriors.
13:19:9/The Ammonites positioned themselves for battle at the city gate, while the allied kings took their positions in the open field.
13:19:10/Joab, seeing the battle lines against him both in front and behind, selected the best troops of Israel to face the Syrians.
13:19:11/He assigned the rest of the forces to his brother Abishai, positioning them against the Ammonites.
13:19:12/He said, "If the Syrians overpower me, you must come to my aid; if the Ammonites overpower you, I'll help you."
13:19:13/"Let's be brave and fight valiantly for our people and the cities of our God. May the LORD do what seems right to Him."
13:19:14/So Joab and his troops advanced towards the Syrians for battle, and the Syrians fled from them.
13:19:15/When the Ammonites saw the Syrians fleeing, they too fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem.
13:19:16/Seeing their defeat by Israel, the Syrians sent messengers to summon additional Syrian forces from beyond the river, with Shophach, the commander of Hadarezer's army, leading them.
13:19:17/When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, engaged them, and arranged his forces for battle. David fought the Syrians.
13:19:18/But the Syrians fled from Israel, and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers, including Shophach, the army commander.
13:19:19/When Hadarezer's servants realized they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. After that, the Syrians refused to support the Ammonites again.
13:20:1/After a year had passed, during the season when kings typically went to war, Joab led the army's forces, devastated the land of the Ammonites, and laid siege to Rabbah. David, however, stayed in Jerusalem. Joab conquered Rabbah and destroyed it.
13:20:2/David removed the crown from their king's head, which weighed a talent of gold and was adorned with precious stones, and placed it on his own head. He also took a great amount of loot from the city.
13:20:3/He took the people within the city and subjected them to harsh treatment with saws, iron harrows, and axes. This was how David treated all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his people returned to Jerusalem.
13:20:4/After this, a war broke out in Gezer with the Philistines; during this time, Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and they were defeated.
13:20:5/There was another battle with the Philistines, where Elhanan, the son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear was as big as a weaver's beam.
13:20:6/And again, there was a battle in Gath, where there was a man of great size, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and foot, who was also descended from the giants.
13:20:7/But when he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
13:20:8/These were descendants of the giants in Gath; they fell by the hand of David and his servants.
13:21:1/And Satan rose against Israel, inciting David to take a census of Israel.
13:21:2/And David instructed Joab and the leaders of the people, "Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan; and report back to me with the total, so I may know it."
13:21:3/Joab responded, "May the LORD multiply his people a hundred times over. But my lord the king, aren't they all your servants? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt upon Israel?"
13:21:4/Yet the king's command was stronger than Joab's objections. So Joab left, traveled throughout all Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem.
13:21:5/Joab presented the total population count to David. All of Israel had 1,100,000 men who could handle a sword, and Judah had 470,000 men who could handle a sword.
13:21:6/However, Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king's order was detestable to him.
13:21:7/And God was displeased with this action, so he struck Israel.
13:21:8/And David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."
13:21:9/And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
13:21:10/"Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"
13:21:11/So Gad went to David and told him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Choose
13:21:12/Either three years of famine, three months of being defeated by your enemies with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the LORD's sword—plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD wreaking havoc throughout all Israel's territories. Now decide what answer I should take back to the one who sent me.'"
13:21:13/David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into human hands."
13:21:14/So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
13:21:15/And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw and reconsidered the disaster, and said to the angel causing the destruction, "Enough, withdraw your hand now." And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13:21:16/When David looked up, he saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
13:21:17/And David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the census of the people? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. But these sheep, what have they done? LORD my God, let your hand be against me and my family, but do not let this plague be on your people."
13:21:18/Then the angel of the LORD instructed Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13:21:19/And David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
13:21:20/Ornan turned around and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
13:21:21/As David approached Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, stepped off the threshing floor, and bowed down to David with his face to the ground.
13:21:22/Then David said to Ornan, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD on it. Sell it to me at the full price, so the plague on the people may be stopped."
13:21:23/Ornan said to David, "Take it, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Look, I also provide the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give it all."
13:21:24/But King David said to Ornan, "No, I insist on buying it for the full price. I will not take what is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
13:21:25/So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold for the site.
13:21:26/David built an altar there to the LORD, offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
13:21:27/And the LORD commanded the angel, and he sheathed his sword.
13:21:28/At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
13:21:29/For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.
13:21:30/But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
13:22:1/Then David said, "This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar for burnt offerings for Israel."
13:22:2/And David ordered the gathering of the foreigners in the land of Israel; he assigned masons to cut dressed stones to construct the house of God.
13:22:3/And David stockpiled a large amount of iron for the nails for the gate doors and for the fittings; and he gathered a vast quantity of bronze, too much to weigh.
13:22:4/He also acquired a great number of cedar trees because the people of Sidon and Tyre brought a lot of cedar wood to David.
13:22:5/And David said, "Solomon, my son, is young and inexperienced, and the temple to be built for the LORD must be extremely magnificent, famous, and glorious throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparations for it now." So David made extensive preparations before his death.
13:22:6/Then he summoned Solomon his son and instructed him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
13:22:7/And David told Solomon, "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the name of the LORD my God.
13:22:8/But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed a lot of blood and have waged great wars. You will not build a house for my name because you have shed so much blood on the earth in my sight.
13:22:9/Look, a son will be born to you, who will be a man of peace; I will give him rest from all his enemies around him. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
13:22:10/He will build a house for my name; he will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish his kingdom over Israel forever.
13:22:11/Now, my son, may the LORD be with you; succeed and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has said about you.
13:22:12/May the LORD grant you wisdom and understanding, and may he put you in charge of Israel, so that you may follow the law of the LORD your God.
13:22:13/Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or discouraged.
13:22:14/Now, look, in my efforts I have prepared for the house of the LORD 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing; they are in great quantity. Timber and stone I have also prepared, and you can add to them.
13:22:15/Moreover, you have many workers with you, stonecutters, carpenters, and artisans of every kind skilled in every kind of work.
13:22:16/The gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron are beyond measure. Get up and start the work, and may the LORD be with you."
13:22:17/David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to support Solomon his son, saying,
13:22:18/"Isn't the LORD your God with you? And hasn't he given you peace on every side? For he has handed over the inhabitants of the land to me, and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people.
13:22:19/Now, set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Get up and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you can bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God into the temple that will be built for the name of the LORD.
13:23:1/So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
13:23:2/And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites.
13:23:3/Now the Levites were counted from the age of thirty years and older: and their total number, counting each man individually, was thirty-eight thousand.
13:23:4/Out of these, twenty-four thousand were assigned to advance the work of the LORD's house; and six thousand served as officers and judges:
13:23:5/Furthermore, four thousand were gatekeepers; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise with them.
13:23:6/And David organized them into groups among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
13:23:7/From the Gershonites came Laadan, and Shimei.
13:23:8/The sons of Laadan; the leader was Jehiel, followed by Zetham, and Joel, making three.
13:23:9/The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the leaders of the fathers of Laadan.
13:23:10/And the sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
13:23:11/And Jahath was the leader, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many sons; therefore, they were counted together, according to their father’s household.
13:23:12/The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
13:23:13/The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was set apart, to consecrate the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to serve him, and to bless in his name forever.
13:23:14/Regarding Moses the man of God, his sons were named from the tribe of Levi.
13:23:15/The sons of Moses were Gershom, and Eliezer.
13:23:16/Among the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
13:23:17/And the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
13:23:18/From the sons of Izhar; Shelomith was the chief.
13:23:19/From the sons of Hebron; Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
13:23:20/From the sons of Uzziel; Micah was the first and Jesiah the second.
13:23:21/The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
13:23:22/And Eleazar died, leaving no sons, only daughters: and their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
13:23:23/The sons of Mushi; Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
13:23:24/These were the sons of Levi by their ancestral houses; even the leaders of the fathers, as they were counted by name individually, who worked in the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and older.
13:23:25/For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest to his people, so they may live in Jerusalem forever: 
13:23:26/And also to the Levites; they will no longer carry the tabernacle, nor any of its equipment for its service.
13:23:27/For by David's final instructions, the Levites were counted from twenty years old and older: 
13:23:28/Because their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron in the service of the LORD's house, in the courtyards, and in the rooms, and in the purification of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 
13:23:29/Including for the showbread, and for the fine flour for grain offerings, and for the unleavened bread, and for what is baked in the pan, and for what is fried, and for all kinds of measurements and sizes; 
13:23:30/And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise in the evening: 
13:23:31/And to offer all burnt offerings to the LORD on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts, by number, according to the regulation commanded to them, continually before the LORD: 
13:23:32/And that they should keep the responsibility of the tabernacle of meeting, and the responsibility of the holy place, and the responsibility of the sons of Aaron their brothers, in the service of the house of the LORD.
13:24:1/Here are the divisions of Aaron's sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar were Aaron's sons.
13:24:2/But Nadab and Abihu died before their father without having any children, so Eleazar and Ithamar took on the role of priests.
13:24:3/David assigned their duties, dividing them between Zadok from Eleazar's descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar's descendants, based on their specific roles in service.
13:24:4/There were more leaders found among Eleazar's descendants than Ithamar's, leading to their division. From Eleazar's line, there were sixteen leaders, and from Ithamar's, eight, according to their family lineage.
13:24:5/They were divided by drawing lots, treating each group equally; this included the leaders of the sanctuary and the house of God, coming from both Eleazar and Ithamar's lines.
13:24:6/Shemaiah, son of Nethaneel the scribe and a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the priestly and Levitical families, with one leading family chosen for Eleazar and one for Ithamar.

13:24:18/The twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
13:24:19/These were their assignments for serving in the LORD's house, following the procedures established by their ancestor Aaron, as commanded by the LORD God of Israel.
13:24:20/The other descendants of Levi included: From Amram's line, Shubael; from Shubael's line, Jehdeiah.

13:24:29/Regarding Kish: Jerahmeel was Kish's son.
13:24:30/Mushi's sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the Levites according to their family lineage.
13:24:31/They also drew lots just like their relatives, the sons of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the priestly and Levitical families, with the senior families drawing lots alongside their younger relatives.
13:25:1/Furthermore, David and the leaders of the army set apart for service the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, lyres, and cymbals. The total number of skilled workers for this service was:
13:25:2/Among the sons of Asaph were Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. They were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied as instructed by the king.
13:25:3/From Jeduthun's lineage came Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six in total, under their father Jeduthun's guidance. He prophesied with a harp to give thanks and praise to the LORD.

13:27:33/Ahithophel served as the king's advisor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.
13:27:34/After Ahithophel, Jehoiada son of Benaiah and Abiathar served, with Joab as the commander of the king's army.
13:28:1/David gathered all the leaders of Israel, including the tribal princes, the commanders of the units serving the king, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, the overseers of the king's property and possessions, his sons, the officials, the mighty warriors, and all the brave soldiers, to Jerusalem.
13:28:2/Then King David stood up and said, "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I wanted to build a temple as a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and for God's footstool, and I prepared for its construction.
13:28:3/But God told me, 'You are not to build a temple for my name because you are a warrior and have shed blood.'
13:28:4/However, the Lord, the God of Israel, chose me from my entire family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the tribe of Judah, my family, and from my father's sons, He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
13:28:5/Among all my sons (for the Lord has given me many), He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the Lord's kingdom over Israel.
13:28:6/And He said to me, 'Your son Solomon is the one who will build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
13:28:7/Furthermore, I will establish his kingdom forever if he remains committed to following my commands and decrees, as he is doing today.'
13:28:8/So now, in the presence of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, be diligent in observing all the commands of the Lord your God, so you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.
13:28:9/And you, Solomon my son, recognize the God of your father and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind. For the Lord searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you abandon Him, He will reject you forever.
13:28:10/Be careful now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a temple as His sanctuary. Be strong and carry out the task."
13:28:11/Then David gave Solomon the plans for the temple porch, its buildings, its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, and the place for the mercy seat,
13:28:12/And the plans for everything he had in mind for the courtyards of the Lord's temple, all the surrounding rooms, the treasuries of God's temple, and the treasuries for the dedicated things.
13:28:13/He also provided for the divisions of the priests and Levites, for all the work of serving in the Lord's temple, and for all the articles used in service in the temple.
13:28:14/David allocated gold by weight for all gold articles for various services, and silver for all silver articles for various kinds of service.
13:28:15/He specified the weight for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps, and for the silver lampstands, each according to its service.
13:28:16/He provided gold by weight for the tables of the Bread of the Presence, for each table, and silver for the silver tables.
13:28:17/He also provided pure gold for the forks, bowls, and cups, and for the golden basins, he gave gold by weight for each basin, and silver by weight for each silver basin.
13:28:18/And for the altar of incense, he provided refined gold by weight, and gold for the model of the chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and sheltered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
13:28:19/David said, "The Lord gave me understanding in writing, by His hand upon me, of all the details of this plan."
13:28:20/And David told Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or abandon you until all the work for the service of the temple of the Lord is finished.
13:28:21/And see, the divisions of the priests and Levites for all the service of God's temple are at your disposal. You will have with you every willing and skilled person for any kind of work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command."
13:29:1/David the king said to the whole assembly, "Solomon, my son, whom God has uniquely chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and the task is immense. This palace is not for humans, but for the LORD God.
13:29:2/I have done my utmost to prepare for the temple of my God, providing gold for the goldwork, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the ironwork, and wood for the woodwork; onyx stones and setting stones, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and plenty of marble.
13:29:3/Because I have set my heart on the temple of my God, I have given from my personal wealth toward the temple of my God, in addition to everything I've prepared for the holy temple.
13:29:4/I've provided 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir and 7,000 talents of refined silver to cover the walls of the buildings.
13:29:5/The gold for the goldwork, the silver for the silverwork, and for all kinds of craftsmanship. Now, who is willing to dedicate themselves to the LORD today?
13:29:6/Then the leaders of families, the princes of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.
13:29:7/They contributed to the service of the temple of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.
13:29:8/Those who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
13:29:9/The people rejoiced at their willingness to give, for they gave freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. King David also rejoiced greatly.
13:29:10/Therefore, David praised the LORD in front of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise be to you, LORD, the God of our ancestor Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
13:29:11/Yours, LORD, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty. Everything in heaven and on earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.
13:29:12/Wealth and honor come from you; you rule over everything. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
13:29:13/Now, our God, we give you thanks and praise your glorious name.
13:29:14/But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
13:29:15/We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
13:29:16/O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your holy name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.
13:29:17/I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.
13:29:18/O LORD, the God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.
13:29:19/And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, statutes and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."
13:29:20/Then David said to the whole assembly, "Now praise the LORD your God." So the whole assembly praised the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and they bowed down, prostrating themselves before the LORD and the king.
13:29:21/They offered sacrifices to the LORD and presented burnt offerings to the LORD the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
13:29:22/They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they made Solomon, son of David, king for the second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.
13:29:23/Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He succeeded, and all Israel obeyed him.
13:29:24/All the officials, the mighty warriors, and all of King David's sons pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
13:29:25/The LORD greatly exalted Solomon in the eyes of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel had ever had before.
13:29:26/David, son of Jesse, ruled over all Israel.
13:29:27/He ruled over Israel for forty years; seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
13:29:28/He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth, and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.
13:29:29/The acts of King David, from beginning to end, are written in the records of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer,
13:29:30/including all his reign, his power, and the events that affected him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the lands.
14:1:1/Solomon, the son of David, became strong in his kingdom, with the LORD his God supporting him and greatly enhancing his stature.
14:1:2/Then Solomon addressed all of Israel, including the military commanders, judges, and every regional governor, the leaders of the families.
14:1:3/So Solomon, along with the entire assembly, went to the high place at Gibeon; because that was where the tent of meeting with God, which Moses, the LORD's servant, had made in the desert, was located.
14:1:4/However, the ark of God had been moved by David from Kirjathjearim to a site he had prepared for it; he had set up a tent for it in Jerusalem.
14:1:5/Furthermore, the bronze altar made by Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, was placed in front of the LORD's tent; Solomon and the assembly sought it out.
14:1:6/And Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
14:1:7/That night, God appeared to Solomon and said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."
14:1:8/And Solomon said to God, "You have shown great kindness to my father David, and have made me king in his place."
14:1:9/Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be fulfilled; for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
14:1:10/Grant me now wisdom and knowledge, so I can lead this people properly; for who can govern this great people of yours?
14:1:11/And God said to Solomon, "Because this was your desire, and you have not asked for riches, wealth, or honor, nor the death of your foes, nor have you asked for a long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people, over whom I have made you king:
14:1:12/Wisdom and knowledge are given to you; and I will also give you riches, wealth, and honor unlike any kings before you, nor will any after you have the same."
14:1:13/Then Solomon returned from his trip to the high place at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and ruled over Israel.
14:1:14/And Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen: he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14:1:15/The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the lowlands.
14:1:16/And Solomon imported horses from Egypt and linen yarn; the king's merchants purchased the linen yarn at a fixed price.
14:1:17/They also imported and brought from Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, they supplied horses to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria through their intermediaries.
14:2:1/Solomon decided to build a temple for the LORD's name and a palace for his own reign.
14:2:2/Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to carry loads, eighty thousand to quarry in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to supervise them.
14:2:3/Solomon sent a message to Huram, king of Tyre, saying, "Just as you dealt with my father David, sending him cedars to build a residence, please do the same for me.
14:2:4/"I am building a temple to honor the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, to offer sweet incense before him, for the regular presentation of the showbread, and for the burnt offerings every morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and during the LORD our God's appointed festivals. This will be a perpetual ordinance for Israel.
14:2:5/"The temple I am building will be magnificent because our God is greater than all other gods.
14:2:6/"But who can really build a temple for him, since even the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain him? Who am I, then, to build a temple for him, except as a place to offer sacrifices before him?
14:2:7/"Therefore, send me a craftsman skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in dyeing purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave, to join the skilled craftsmen I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided.
14:2:8/"Also, send me cedar, fir, and algum trees from Lebanon, for I know your servants are experts at logging in Lebanon; and my servants will work alongside yours,
14:2:9/"to provide me with plenty of timber, because the temple I intend to build will be incredibly magnificent.
14:2:10/"And look, I will supply your workers, the loggers, with twenty thousand cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of olive oil."
14:2:11/Then Huram, king of Tyre, replied in a letter to Solomon, "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king."
14:2:12/Huram also said, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who created the heavens and the earth, for giving David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
14:2:13/"Now, I am sending a skilled man, endowed with understanding, from Huram my father's lineage,
14:2:14/"He is the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan and his father was a man of Tyre, skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in dyeing purple, blue, fine linen, and crimson. He is also skilled in engraving and can execute any design given to him, working alongside your skilled men and those of my lord David, your father.
14:2:15/"Now then, send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine you mentioned to your servants,
14:2:16/"and we will cut as much wood from Lebanon as you need and float it by sea to Joppa, so you can transport it to Jerusalem."
14:2:17/And Solomon registered all the foreigners in the land of Israel, following the census his father David had taken; they totaled one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.
14:2:18/He assigned seventy thousand of them as carriers, eighty thousand as stonecutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred as overseers to manage the workforce.
14:3:1/Solomon began constructing the LORD's temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the site David had prepared on Ornan the Jebusite's threshing floor.
14:3:2/He started the construction on the second day of the second month, during the fourth year of his reign.
14:3:3/The construction plans for the temple of God included a length of sixty cubits and a width of twenty cubits, using the original measurements.
14:3:4/The front porch of the temple was as wide as the temple itself, twenty cubits, and it was one hundred and twenty cubits high. He covered the inside with pure gold.
14:3:5/He paneled the larger room with fir wood, which he covered with fine gold, and decorated it with palm trees and chains.
14:3:6/He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and the gold used was the high-quality gold from Parvaim.
14:3:7/He also covered the temple's beams, posts, walls, and doors with gold, and carved cherubim on the walls.
14:3:8/He constructed the Most Holy Place, making it twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, matching the width of the temple, and covered it with fine gold totaling six hundred talents.
14:3:9/The nails weighed fifty shekels of gold. He also covered the upper rooms with gold.
14:3:10/In the Most Holy Place, he crafted two cherubim from wood and covered them with gold.
14:3:11/The wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits; one wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, touching the temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the second cherub.
14:3:12/One wing of the second cherub was five cubits long, touching the temple wall, and its other wing, five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.
14:3:13/The cherubim spread their wings out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing inward.
14:3:14/He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and embroidered cherubim on it.
14:3:15/He also constructed two pillars thirty-five cubits high in front of the temple, with a capital five cubits high on top of each.
14:3:16/He made chains as in the inner sanctuary and placed them on the tops of the pillars; he also made one hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.
14:3:17/He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, and named the right pillar Jachin and the left pillar Boaz.
14:4:1/Furthermore, he constructed an altar made of bronze, measuring twenty cubits in length and breadth, and ten cubits in height.
14:4:2/He also crafted a large bronze basin, ten cubits from edge to edge, circular in shape, five cubits tall, and surrounded by a thirty-cubit measuring line.
14:4:3/Beneath it were figures of oxen encircling it all around: ten per cubit, encircling the basin. Two rows of oxen were molded into it when it was cast.
14:4:4/It rested on twelve oxen, with three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the basin was set on top of them, and all their rear parts were inward.
14:4:5/The basin's wall was as thick as the width of a hand, and its rim was like the edge of a cup decorated with lily flowers; it could hold and contain three thousand baths.
14:4:6/He also made ten washbasins and placed five on the right side and five on the left for washing; the items for the burnt offering were washed in them, but the large basin was for the priests to wash in.
14:4:7/And he crafted ten golden lampstands according to their design and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
14:4:8/He also made ten tables and arranged them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made a hundred golden basins.
14:4:9/Additionally, he constructed the courtyard for the priests, the large courtyard, and the doors for the courtyard, covering the doors with bronze.
14:4:10/And he positioned the large basin on the right side of the temple's east end, facing south.
14:4:11/And Huram crafted the pots, shovels, and basins. Huram completed the work he had been commissioned to do for King Solomon in the house of God;
14:4:12/Namely, the two pillars, the capitals on top of the pillars, and the two networks to decorate the two capitals on top of the pillars;
14:4:13/And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, with two rows of pomegranates for each network, to decorate the two capitals on top of the pillars.
14:4:14/He also made stands and placed the washbasins on the stands;
14:4:15/A large basin and twelve oxen beneath it.
14:4:16/The pots, shovels, meat hooks, and all their accessories, Huram his father crafted for King Solomon for the LORD's house out of polished bronze.
14:4:17/In the Jordan plain, the king had them cast in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredathah.
14:4:18/Thus, Solomon made all these items in great quantity; the weight of the bronze was beyond measure.
14:4:19/And Solomon made all the items for God's house, including the golden altar and the tables for the bread of the Presence;
14:4:20/Also the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn in the prescribed manner in front of the inner sanctuary;
14:4:21/And the flowers, lamps, and tongs, he made of gold, of the finest quality;
14:4:22/And the trimmers, basins, ladles, and censers, of pure gold. As for the entrance of the temple, the inner doors for the Most Holy Place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple, they were gold.
14:5:1/So, all the work Solomon did for the LORD's house was completed: Solomon brought in everything his father David had dedicated; the silver, gold, and all the equipment were placed among the treasures of God's house.
14:5:2/Then Solomon gathered the elders of Israel, all the tribal leaders, and the heads of the families of the Israelites in Jerusalem, to move the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the City of David, which is Zion.
14:5:3/That's why all the men of Israel came together to the king during the festival in the seventh month.
14:5:4/All the elders of Israel arrived; and the Levites carried the ark.
14:5:5/They moved the ark, the meeting tent, and all the sacred objects in the tent; the priests and Levites brought them up.
14:5:6/King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel gathered before the ark, offering so many sheep and oxen they couldn't be counted.
14:5:7/The priests then placed the ark of the covenant of the LORD in its spot, in the inner sanctuary of the temple, under the wings of the cherubim.
14:5:8/The cherubim spread their wings over the ark's location, covering the ark and its carrying poles from above.
14:5:9/They extended the poles of the ark so that the ends were visible from the Holy of Holies but not from outside, and they are still there today.
14:5:10/The only items in the ark were the two stone tablets Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt.
14:5:11/When the priests exited the sanctuary (for all the priests present had purified themselves, not adhering to their divisions,
14:5:12/The Levite singers, all from Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, along with their sons and relatives, dressed in white linen, with cymbals, lyres, and harps, stood at the east side of the altar, accompanied by 120 priests blowing trumpets.)
14:5:13/As the trumpeters and singers united in one voice to praise and thank the LORD, and when they raised their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments, in praise to the LORD, saying, "For he is good; his love endures forever," a cloud filled the temple, the house of the LORD.
14:5:14/So intense was the cloud, the glory of the LORD filled God's house, that the priests couldn't continue their service.
14:6:1/Then Solomon said, "The LORD has declared He would dwell in deep darkness.
14:6:2/But I have built a house for You to live in, a place for You to dwell forever.
14:6:3/And the king turned around, blessing the entire assembly of Israel while they all stood.
14:6:4/He said, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with His own hands has fulfilled what He promised with His mouth to my father David, saying,
14:6:5/'Since the day I brought My people out of Egypt, I did not choose any city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house where My Name would be. I did not choose anyone to be the leader over My people Israel.
14:6:6/But I have chosen Jerusalem for My Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule over My people Israel.'
14:6:7/It was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14:6:8/But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you did well to have this in your heart.
14:6:9/However, you will not build the house; instead, your son, who will come from your own body, he will build the house for My Name.'
14:6:10/The LORD has kept the promise He made: I have succeeded David my father and now sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14:6:11/And in it, I have placed the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with the people of Israel.
14:6:12/He stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
14:6:13/For Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the center of the courtyard. On it, he stood, then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
14:6:14/And said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart,
14:6:15/You who have kept Your promise to Your servant David my father; what You declared with Your mouth, You have fulfilled with Your hand, as it is today.
14:6:16/Now, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father what You have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in My law as you have walked before Me.'
14:6:17/Now, O LORD, the God of Israel, let Your word that You have promised to Your servant David be confirmed.
14:6:18/But will God indeed dwell with humans on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house that I have built!
14:6:19/Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that Your servant prays before You,
14:6:20/That Your eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where You have said You would put Your Name, to listen to the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place.
14:6:21/Listen to the pleas of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from Your dwelling place, from heaven; and when You hear, forgive.
14:6:22/If someone sins against their neighbor and is required to take an oath, and they come and swear the oath before Your altar in this house,
14:6:23/Then hear from heaven and act. Judge Your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing their conduct on their own heads, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding them according to their righteousness.
14:6:24/If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading with You in this house,
14:6:25/Then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land You gave to them and their ancestors.
14:6:26/When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, yet if they pray toward this place and confess Your name, turning from their sin when You afflict them,
14:6:27/Then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, teaching them the good way in which they should walk, and send rain on Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.
14:6:28/If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,
14:6:29/Whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any individual or by all Your people Israel, each knowing their own affliction and their own sorrow and stretching out their hands toward this house,
14:6:30/Then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each whose heart You know, according to all his ways, for You, You only, know the hearts of the children of mankind,
14:6:31/That they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days that they live in the land that You gave to our ancestors.
14:6:32/Also concerning the foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel but comes from a far country for the sake of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray in this house,
14:6:33/Then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and may know that this house that I have built is called by Your name.
14:6:34/If Your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to You toward this city that You have chosen and the house that I have built for Your name,
14:6:35/Then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.
14:6:36/If they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are taken captive to a land far or near,
14:6:37/Yet if they turn their hearts in the land to which they have been taken captive, and repent and plead with You in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,'
14:6:38/If they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray toward their land, which You gave to their fathers, the city that You have chosen, and the house that I have built for Your name,
14:6:39/Then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, their prayer and their pleas, and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.
14:6:40/Now, my God, may Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer made in this place.
14:6:41/Now therefore arise, O LORD God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your might. Let Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let Your faithful ones rejoice in goodness.
14:6:42/O LORD God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed one. Remember Your steadfast love for David Your servant.
14:7:1/After Solomon finished praying, fire descended from heaven, consuming the burnt offering and sacrifices; and the LORD's glory filled the temple.
14:7:2/The priests couldn't enter the LORD's temple because the LORD's glory had completely filled it.
14:7:3/When all the Israelites saw the fire descend and the LORD's glory over the temple, they knelt with their faces to the ground on the pavement, worshiping and praising the LORD, saying, "For he is good; his love lasts forever."
14:7:4/Then the king and all the people presented sacrifices to the LORD.
14:7:5/King Solomon sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep: thus, the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.
14:7:6/The priests performed their duties: the Levites too, with musical instruments of the LORD that King David had made to praise the LORD, "because his love endures forever," as David praised through their ministry; and the priests played trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
14:7:7/Furthermore, Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the LORD's temple: there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made couldn't hold the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat.
14:7:8/At the same time, Solomon celebrated the festival for seven days, along with a vast assembly from all over Israel, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
14:7:9/And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, having celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days.
14:7:10/On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness the LORD had shown to David, Solomon, and to his people Israel.
14:7:11/So Solomon completed the LORD's temple and the royal palace. Everything that Solomon had planned to do in the LORD's temple and in his own palace succeeded.
14:7:12/The LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.
14:7:13/If I close the sky so there's no rain, or command locusts to devour the land, or send a plague among my people;
14:7:14/If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
14:7:15/Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
14:7:16/For now, I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my name may be there forever; my eyes and my heart will always be there.
14:7:17/And as for you, if you walk before me as David your father did, and do everything I command, and keep my decrees and laws;
14:7:18/Then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, 'You will never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.'
14:7:19/But if you turn away and abandon my decrees and commands I have set before you and go off to serve other gods and worship them;
14:7:20/Then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them; and this temple, which I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and it will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
14:7:21/And this temple, now exalted, will become a ruin. Everyone passing by will be shocked and will ask, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'
14:7:22/And the answer will be, 'Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them. That is why he brought all this disaster on them.'
14:8:1/After twenty years, during which Solomon had built the temple of the LORD and his own palace,
14:8:2/Solomon rebuilt the cities Huram had given back to him and settled the Israelites in them.
14:8:3/Solomon also conquered Hamathzobah.
14:8:4/He built Tadmor in the desert and all the storage cities he constructed in Hamath.
14:8:5/He also constructed both Upper and Lower Bethhoron as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars;
14:8:6/And Baalath, as well as all the storage cities Solomon had, the cities for his chariots and horsemen, and everything Solomon wanted to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout his entire territory.
14:8:7/Regarding all the people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites,
14:8:8/But from their descendants, who remained in the land after them, whom the Israelites did not completely destroy, Solomon imposed forced labor that continues to this day.
14:8:9/However, Solomon did not make slaves out of the Israelites; they served as soldiers, commanders of his army, and officers of his chariots and cavalry.
14:8:10/These were the chief officials of King Solomon, numbering two hundred and fifty, who oversaw the people.
14:8:11/Solomon moved Pharaoh's daughter from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, saying, "My wife shall not live in King David's palace of Israel, because the places the Ark of the LORD has entered are sacred."
14:8:12/Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD he had built in front of the temple porch,
14:8:13/Offering sacrifices according to Moses' commandment every day, on Sabbaths, new moons, and during the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles.
14:8:14/He followed his father David's instructions regarding the divisions of the priests for their duties and the Levites for their roles of praise and service before the priests as required each day. He also organized the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, as David, the man of God, had ordered.
14:8:15/They did not deviate from the king's commands to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, including the treasuries.
14:8:16/All of Solomon's work was prepared up to the day the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, and until its completion. Thus, the temple of the LORD was finished.
14:8:17/Then Solomon went to Eziongeber and Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom.
14:8:18/Huram sent him ships and experienced seafaring men through his servants. They sailed with Solomon's servants to Ophir, collected four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them back to King Solomon.
14:9:1/When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's fame, she came to test him with difficult questions in Jerusalem, bringing a huge entourage, camels loaded with spices, lots of gold, and precious stones. Upon arriving, she discussed everything on her mind with Solomon.
14:9:2/Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing he couldn't explain to her.
14:9:3/When the queen of Sheba witnessed Solomon's wisdom, and the palace he had built,
14:9:4/And saw the food on his table, the organization of his servants, the service and attire of his ministers, his cupbearers, and their uniforms, and the stairway he used to go up to the house of the LORD, she was utterly amazed.
14:9:5/She told the king, "The reports I heard in my own country about your achievements and wisdom are true.
14:9:6/But I didn't believe them until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half of your wisdom was told to me; you surpass the fame I had heard.
14:9:7/Your officials and servants are fortunate to stand before you and hear your wisdom.
14:9:8/Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on his throne as king for the LORD your God. Because your God loves Israel and wants to establish them forever, he has made you king over them, to rule with justice and righteousness.
14:9:9/She gave the king 120 talents of gold, a huge quantity of spices, and precious stones. There was no spice like the ones the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
14:9:10/The servants of Huram and Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones.
14:9:11/The king used the algum trees to make steps for the LORD's temple and the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen before in Judah.
14:9:12/King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, in addition to what she had brought to the king. Then she returned to her own country with her servants.
14:9:13/In one year, Solomon received 666 talents of gold,
14:9:14/Besides what was brought by the merchants and traders. Moreover, all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
14:9:15/King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield.
14:9:16/He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king placed them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
14:9:17/Furthermore, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
14:9:18/The throne had six steps, and a gold footstool was attached to it. There were armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.
14:9:19/Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. No other kingdom had anything like it.
14:9:20/All of King Solomon's drinking vessels were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Silver was considered of little value in Solomon's days.
14:9:21/The king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Every three years, the ships of Tarshish would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
14:9:22/King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
14:9:23/All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had placed in his heart.
14:9:24/They brought gifts: silver and gold vessels, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, year after year.
14:9:25/Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14:9:26/He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.
14:9:27/The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as plentiful as the sycamores in the foothills.
14:9:28/People brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all countries.
14:9:29/The rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
14:9:30/Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
14:9:31/Solomon passed away and was buried in the city of David his father, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
14:10:1/And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
14:10:2/When Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had fled to Egypt to escape King Solomon, heard about it, he came back from Egypt.
14:10:3/They sent for him, and Jeroboam and all of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
14:10:4/Your father made our burden heavy: now, please lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.
14:10:5/He told them, "Come back to me in three days." So the people left.
14:10:6/King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime, asking, "What is your advice on how to respond to these people?"
14:10:7/They replied, "If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak kindly to them, they will be your servants forever."
14:10:8/But he ignored the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men he had grown up with, who were now his advisors.
14:10:9/He asked them, "What is your advice for us to answer these people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
14:10:10/The young men he had grown up with told him, "Tell the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us,' that 'My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.
14:10:11/While my father laid a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke: my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
14:10:12/So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had directed, saying, "Come back to me on the third day."
14:10:13/And the king answered them harshly; King Rehoboam disregarded the advice of the elders,
14:10:14/And responded according to the young men's advice, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will make it even heavier: my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
14:10:15/So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill His word, which He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
14:10:16/When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered the king, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now, David, take care of your own house!" So all Israel went to their tents.
14:10:17/But as for the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
14:10:18/Then King Rehoboam sent out Hadoram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to get to his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
14:10:19/And Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
14:11:1/When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he assembled 180,000 elite warriors from Judah and Benjamin to wage war against Israel and reclaim the kingdom for himself.
14:11:2/But God spoke to Shemaiah, the man of God, with a message,
14:11:3/Tell Rehoboam, son of Solomon and king of Judah, and all the people of Judah and Benjamin,
14:11:4/"This is what the LORD says: Do not attack your relatives. Everyone go back home, because I am the one who has caused this situation." They listened to the LORD's command and stopped their march against Jeroboam.
14:11:5/Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem and started fortifying cities in Judah for defense.
14:11:6/He fortified Bethlehem, Etam, and Tekoa,
14:11:7/And Bethzur, Shoco, and Adullam,
14:11:8/And Gath, Mareshah, and Ziph,
14:11:9/And Adoraim, Lachish, and Azekah,
14:11:10/And Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
14:11:11/He strengthened the fortresses, appointed commanders, and stocked them with food, oil, and wine.
14:11:12/In every city, he placed shields and spears, making them very strong, with the support of Judah and Benjamin.
14:11:13/Priests and Levites from all over Israel joined him in Jerusalem from their regions.
14:11:14/The Levites left their rural areas and properties to come to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the LORD.
14:11:15/He appointed his own priests for the high places, for the goat idols, and for the calves he had made.
14:11:16/Those from all the tribes of Israel who were determined to seek the LORD God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14:11:17/This strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam, son of Solomon, for three years because they followed the ways of David and Solomon during this time.
14:11:18/Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and Abihail, daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse;
14:11:19/She bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham.
14:11:20/After her, he married Maachah, daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
14:11:21/Rehoboam loved Maachah, daughter of Absalom, more than all his other wives and concubines. He had eighteen wives, sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters.
14:11:22/Rehoboam appointed Abijah, son of Maachah, as the chief among his brothers, intending to make him king.
14:11:23/He acted wisely, distributing his children throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city, providing them with plenty of food. And he sought many wives.
14:12:1/When Rehoboam had solidified his rule and strengthened himself, he abandoned the LORD's laws, and all of Israel followed suit.
14:12:2/In the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem because they had violated the LORD's commands.
14:12:3/He came with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen, and the number of people with him from Egypt was beyond counting; this included the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
14:12:4/He captured the fortified cities belonging to Judah and advanced to Jerusalem.
14:12:5/Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he told them, "This is what the LORD says: You have abandoned me, so I have left you in the hands of Shishak."
14:12:6/In response, the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is just."
14:12:7/When the LORD saw that they had humbled themselves, He sent this message through Shemaiah: "They have humbled themselves; therefore, I will not destroy them. I will give them some relief, and my anger will not be unleashed on Jerusalem through Shishak."
14:12:8/However, they will become his subjects, so they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kingdoms of other lands.
14:12:9/So Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem and took the treasures of the LORD's house and the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made.
14:12:10/In their place, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and assigned them to the commanders of the guard who protected the palace entrance.
14:12:11/Whenever the king went to the LORD's house, the guards would carry these shields, and afterward, they would return them to the guardroom.
14:12:12/When he humbled himself, the LORD's anger subsided, and He decided not to destroy him completely. Moreover, conditions in Judah improved.
14:12:13/So King Rehoboam consolidated his power in Jerusalem and continued to reign. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel for His name to be honored. His mother was Naamah, an Ammonite.
14:12:14/He did wrong because he did not set his heart on seeking the LORD.
14:12:15/The events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in the writings of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer, which include genealogies. And there were ongoing wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
14:12:16/Rehoboam passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah succeeded him as king.
14:13:1/Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to rule over Judah.
14:13:2/He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
14:13:3/Abijah prepared for battle with an army of valiant warriors, totaling four hundred thousand select men. Jeroboam also prepared for battle against him with eight hundred thousand select men, who were mighty warriors.
14:13:4/Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the Ephraim range, and said, "Listen to me, Jeroboam, and all of Israel;
14:13:5/Shouldn't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, granted the kingdom over Israel to David forever, to him and his descendants through a perpetual covenant?
14:13:6/Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and a servant of Solomon, son of David, has risen and rebelled against his master.
14:13:7/He has gathered worthless men, rebels, around him and has grown strong against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and inexperienced and unable to stand up to them.
14:13:8/And now you think you can resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David's descendants. You are a vast multitude, and you have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made as your gods.
14:13:9/Have you not expelled the LORD's priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites, and appointed your own priests like the nations around you? Anyone who comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of what are not gods.
14:13:10/But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not abandoned Him. The priests serving the LORD are from Aaron's descendants, and the Levites attend to their duties.
14:13:11/They offer burnt sacrifices and fragrant incense to the LORD every morning and every evening. They also set the showbread in order on the pure table and light the gold lampstand with its lamps every evening. We are faithful to the LORD our God's commands, but you have abandoned Him.
14:13:12/Look, God Himself is with us as our leader, and His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.
14:13:13/But Jeroboam set an ambush to attack them from behind. So they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
14:13:14/When Judah turned and saw the battle was in front and behind, they cried out to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets.
14:13:15/Then the men of Judah gave a battle cry. As they shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
14:13:16/The Israelites fled before Judah, and God handed them over to Judah.
14:13:17/Abijah and his people inflicted a great defeat on them, killing five hundred thousand of Israel's select warriors.
14:13:18/So the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14:13:19/Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured cities from him, including Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.
14:13:20/Jeroboam did not regain power during the reign of Abijah. The LORD struck him down, and he died.
14:13:21/But Abijah grew powerful, married fourteen wives, and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
14:13:22/The rest of the events of Abijah's reign, his actions, and his words are recorded in the chronicles of the prophet Iddo.
14:14:1/So Abijah passed away and was buried in the city of David. Asa his son took over as king. During his reign, the land experienced peace for ten years.
14:14:2/And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
14:14:3/For he removed the altars of foreign gods, the high places, destroyed the idols, and cut down the sacred groves.
14:14:4/And he instructed Judah to seek the LORD God of their ancestors, and to follow the law and the commandments.
14:14:5/He also removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the idols, and the kingdom was at peace under his rule.
14:14:6/And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land was at peace, and he faced no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
14:14:7/Therefore, he said to Judah, "Let's build these cities, and surround them with walls, towers, gates, and bars, while the land is still ours; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side." So they built and prospered.
14:14:8/And Asa had an army of men equipped with shields and spears, from Judah three hundred thousand; and from Benjamin, those who carried shields and were archers, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were valiant warriors.
14:14:9/And Zerah the Ethiopian came against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots; and he arrived at Mareshah.
14:14:10/Then Asa went out to meet him, and they arranged their forces in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
14:14:11/And Asa called out to the LORD his God, saying, "LORD, it is easy for you to help, whether with many or with those who have no power. Help us, O LORD our God; for we rely on you, and in your name we face this vast army. O LORD, you are our God; do not let anyone defeat you."
14:14:12/So the LORD struck down the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
14:14:13/And Asa and his forces pursued them to Gerar, and the Ethiopians were so thoroughly defeated that they could not recover; they were devastated before the LORD and his forces, and they took a great amount of loot.
14:14:14/And they attacked all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD fell upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was a great deal of loot in them.
14:14:15/They also struck down the livestock encampments, and carried away sheep and camels in great numbers, and then returned to Jerusalem.
14:15:1/The Spirit of God came upon Azariah, the son of Oded.
14:15:2/He went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa, and all of Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you as long as you are with him; if you seek him, you will find him; but if you abandon him, he will abandon you."
14:15:3/For a long time, Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law.
14:15:4/But when they turned to the LORD God of Israel in their distress and sought him, he was found by them.
14:15:5/During those times, there was no peace for anyone going out or coming in, but great troubles were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.
14:15:6/Nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with all kinds of adversity.
14:15:7/So be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work will be rewarded.
14:15:8/When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, removed the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim, and restored the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD.
14:15:9/He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, along with the foreigners from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had joined them, because they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
14:15:10/They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
14:15:11/At that time, they sacrificed to the LORD from the plunder they had brought back, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
14:15:12/They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul.
14:15:13/Anyone who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
14:15:14/They swore an oath to the LORD with loud acclamation, with shouting, with trumpets, and with horns.
14:15:15/All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought him eagerly, and he was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side.
14:15:16/Regarding Maachah, the mother of King Asa, he removed her from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive idol for Asherah. Asa cut down her idol, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
14:15:17/However, the high places were not removed from Israel, yet Asa's heart was fully committed all his days.
14:15:18/He brought into the house of God the items his father had dedicated and those he himself had dedicated—silver, gold, and vessels.
14:15:19/There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
14:16:1/In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasha king of Israel attacked Judah and built Ramah, aiming to block anyone from going to or from Asa king of Judah.
14:16:2/Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the LORD's house and the royal palace, and sent it to Benhadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
14:16:3/"We have an alliance, just as our fathers did. Look, I'm sending you silver and gold; break your alliance with Baasha king of Israel so he will leave me alone."
14:16:4/And Benhadad listened to King Asa and sent his army commanders against the cities of Israel; they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the supply cities of Naphtali.
14:16:5/When Baasha heard about it, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work.
14:16:6/Then King Asa mobilized all of Judah, and they removed the stones and timber Baasha had used for building Ramah; with them, he built Geba and Mizpah.
14:16:7/At that time, Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and told him, "Because you depended on the king of Syria instead of the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped from you.
14:16:8/Weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubims a massive army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, he handed them over to you.
14:16:9/The LORD's eyes scan the whole earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have acted foolishly in this matter. From now on, you will face wars."
14:16:10/Then Asa became furious with the seer and put him in prison because he was enraged over this. And at that time, Asa also oppressed some of the people.
14:16:11/Indeed, the events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14:16:12/In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a severe foot disease. Yet even in his illness, he did not seek the LORD but turned to physicians.
14:16:13/And Asa passed away, joining his ancestors in death in the forty-first year of his reign.
14:16:14/They buried him in his own tomb, which he had carved out for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bed filled with fragrances and various kinds of spices prepared by perfumers' skill, and they held a very great funeral pyre for him.
14:17:1/Jehoshaphat, his son, took over as king, strengthening his position against Israel.
14:17:2/He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and established military posts in the land of Judah and the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
14:17:3/The LORD supported Jehoshaphat because he followed the early ways of his ancestor David and did not worship Baalim;
14:17:4/Instead, he sought the Lord God of his father, followed His commandments, and did not imitate the practices of Israel.
14:17:5/As a result, the LORD solidified his reign; all of Judah brought Jehoshaphat gifts, and he accumulated great wealth and honor.
14:17:6/He was deeply committed to the ways of the LORD and removed the pagan shrines and groves from Judah.
14:17:7/In the third year of his reign, he sent his officials, including Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethaneel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
14:17:8/He also sent Levites with them, namely Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
14:17:9/They taught throughout Judah, carrying the book of the law of the LORD with them, and educated the people in all the cities of Judah.
14:17:10/The fear of the LORD spread to all the neighboring kingdoms, so they did not wage war against Jehoshaphat.
14:17:11/Even some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred goats.
14:17:12/Jehoshaphat's power grew immensely; he built fortresses and supply cities in Judah.
14:17:13/He was heavily involved in the affairs of the cities of Judah, and his army, composed of valiant warriors, was based in Jerusalem.
14:17:14/The military forces were organized by ancestral houses: From Judah, the commanders of thousands included Adnah the chief, who had three hundred thousand valiant warriors.
14:17:15/Next to him was Jehohanan the commander, with two hundred and eighty thousand men.
14:17:16/Following him was Amasiah, son of Zichri, who volunteered for the LORD, with two hundred thousand valiant warriors.
14:17:17/From Benjamin, Eliada, a valiant warrior, led two hundred thousand men armed with bows and shields.
14:17:18/Next to him was Jehozabad, with one hundred and eighty thousand men ready for war.
14:17:19/These forces served the king, in addition to those stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
14:18:1/Jehoshaphat was very wealthy and honored, and he formed an alliance with Ahab.
14:18:2/After a few years, he visited Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people with him, and convinced him to join him in attacking Ramothgilead.
14:18:3/Ahab, the king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, "Will you join me in attacking Ramothgilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you, my people are your people; we will join you in battle."
14:18:4/Then Jehoshaphat suggested to the king of Israel, "Please seek the LORD's guidance today."
14:18:5/So the king of Israel brought together 400 prophets and asked them, "Should we go to war against Ramothgilead, or should I hold back?" They answered, "Go ahead, for God will give it into the king's hand."
14:18:6/But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the LORD here we can inquire of?"
14:18:7/The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, "There is one more man who could inquire of the LORD for us, but I dislike him because he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad—Micaiah, son of Imla." Jehoshaphat replied, "The king shouldn't say such things."
14:18:8/Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Bring Micaiah, son of Imla, quickly."
14:18:9/The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, were sitting on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
14:18:10/Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these, you will gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"
14:18:11/All the prophets were predicting success, saying, "Attack Ramothgilead and be victorious, for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
14:18:12/The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the other prophets are unanimously predicting success for the king. Please let your word be like theirs and speak favorably."
14:18:13/But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can only speak what my God tells me."
14:18:14/When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramothgilead, or should I refrain?" He answered, "Go ahead, you will be successful, and they will be given into your hands."
14:18:15/But the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
14:18:16/Then Micaiah said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These people have no leader. Let them go home in peace.'"
14:18:17/Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad?"
14:18:18/Again Micaiah said, "Listen to the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven standing by, on his right and on his left."
14:18:19/And the LORD said, "Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to attack Ramothgilead and fall there?" One suggested this, and another that.
14:18:20/Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, "I will entice him." "How?" asked the LORD.
14:18:21/The spirit replied, "I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets." And the LORD said, "You will succeed in enticing him. Go and do it."
14:18:22/So now, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has decreed disaster for you.
14:18:23/Then Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, approached, struck Micaiah on the cheek, and asked, "How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"
14:18:24/Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go into an inner room to hide."
14:18:25/Then the king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,
14:18:26/and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.'"
14:18:27/Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me. Listen, everyone!"
14:18:28/So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went up to Ramothgilead.
14:18:29/The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
14:18:30/The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."
14:18:31/When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel," and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; God drew them away from him.
14:18:32/As soon as the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
14:18:33/Then a random arrow shot by an archer struck the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. So he said to his charioteer, "Turn around and get me out of the battle; I've been wounded."
14:18:34/The battle intensified throughout the day, and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. As the sun set, he died.
14:19:1/And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
14:19:2/And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the LORD's wrath is upon you."
14:19:3/Nevertheless, you have done good things, such as removing the pagan shrines from the land and setting your heart on seeking God.
14:19:4/And Jehoshaphat stayed in Jerusalem. He went out again among the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim and led them back to the LORD God of their ancestors.
14:19:5/And he appointed judges throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, in each city,
14:19:6/And said to the judges, "Be careful in what you do, for you are not judging for humans, but for the LORD, who is with you in making decisions."
14:19:7/Therefore, let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be careful and do it, for there is no injustice with the LORD our God, nor favoritism, nor accepting bribes.
14:19:8/Furthermore, in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and leading family heads of Israel for the LORD's judgment and to settle disputes when they returned to Jerusalem.
14:19:9/And he instructed them, saying, "Do this in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and with a whole heart."
14:19:10/And whatever case comes to you from your fellow citizens living in your cities, whether it concerns bloodshed or law and commandment, statutes and judgments, you must warn them so they do not sin against the LORD and his wrath come upon you and your kin. Do this, and you will not be guilty.
14:19:11/And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Act courageously, and the LORD will be with those who do good.
14:20:1/After this, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and others with them came to fight against Jehoshaphat.
14:20:2/Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, "A huge army is coming against you from the other side of the sea, from Syria; they are in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi."
14:20:3/Jehoshaphat was afraid and decided to seek the LORD. He proclaimed a fast throughout all of Judah.
14:20:4/The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; from every town in Judah they came to seek the LORD.
14:20:5/Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new courtyard,
14:20:6/And said, "O LORD, God of our ancestors, aren't you the God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you.
14:20:7/Aren't you our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and gave it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?
14:20:8/They have lived in it and have built a sanctuary for your name, saying,
14:20:9/'If disaster comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.'
14:20:10/Now here are the Ammonites, Moabites, and people from Mount Seir, whose territory you did not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt, so they turned away from them and did not destroy them.
14:20:11/See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.
14:20:12/O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you."
14:20:13/All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the LORD.
14:20:14/Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.
14:20:15/He said: "Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's.
14:20:16/Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.
14:20:17/You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the LORD will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with you.'"
14:20:18/Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD.
14:20:19/Then the Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.
14:20:20/Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful."
14:20:21/After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: "Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever."
14:20:22/As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.
14:20:23/The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
14:20:24/When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped.
14:20:25/When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value—more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it.
14:20:26/On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the LORD. That is why it is called the Valley of Berakah to this day.
14:20:27/Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.
14:20:28/They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and lyres and trumpets.
14:20:29/The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
14:20:30/And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
14:20:31/Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
14:20:32/He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
14:20:33/However, the high places were not removed; the people had not yet set their hearts on the God of their ancestors.
14:20:34/The other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel.
14:20:35/Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who was guilty of wickedness.
14:20:36/He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion Geber,
14:20:37/Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." And the ships were wrecked and were not able to sail to Tarshish.
14:21:1/Jehoshaphat passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. Jehoram, his son, took over as king.
14:21:2/He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat, the king of Israel.
14:21:3/Their father gave them generous gifts of silver, gold, and valuable items, along with fortified cities in Judah. However, he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the eldest.
14:21:4/Once Jehoram became king, he secured his position by killing all his brothers and several of Israel's princes.
14:21:5/Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for eight years in Jerusalem.
14:21:6/He followed the practices of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, because he was married to Ahab's daughter. He did evil in the sight of the LORD.
14:21:7/However, the LORD did not want to destroy the house of David because of the covenant he had made with David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.
14:21:8/During his reign, the Edomites rebelled against Judah's control and appointed their own king.
14:21:9/Jehoram attacked with his princes and all his chariots. He launched a surprise attack at night and defeated the Edomites who had surrounded him, along with their chariot commanders.
14:21:10/So, the Edomites broke free from Judah's control and remain independent to this day. At the same time, Libnah also rebelled because Jehoram had abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors.
14:21:11/He also built pagan shrines in the hills of Judah and led the people of Jerusalem and Judah into idolatry.
14:21:12/Elijah the prophet sent him a letter that said, "This is what the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says: Because you have not followed the paths of your father Jehoshaphat or Asa, king of Judah,
14:21:13/But have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, leading Judah and the people of Jerusalem into idolatry, just as the house of Ahab did, and because you have killed your brothers, your own family, who were better than you,
14:21:14/The LORD will strike your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions with a severe plague.
14:21:15/And you will suffer a severe illness, a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out because of the sickness, day by day."
14:21:16/The LORD incited the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to attack Jehoram.
14:21:17/They invaded Judah, broke into it, and took all the possessions found in the king's palace, along with his sons and wives. Only Jehoahaz, his youngest son, was left.
14:21:18/After all this, the LORD afflicted him with an incurable disease in his intestines.
14:21:19/Eventually, after two years, his intestines came out because of the illness, and he died in great pain. His people did not make a funeral fire in his honor, as they had for his ancestors.
14:21:20/He was thirty-two years old when he became king and reigned in Jerusalem for eight years. He died to no one's regret and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14:22:1/The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place because a group of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had killed all his older siblings. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, took the throne.
14:22:2/Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.
14:22:3/He followed the ways of the house of Ahab because his mother advised him to do evil.
14:22:4/Therefore, he did what was evil in the LORD's eyes, just like the house of Ahab, because they advised him after his father's death, leading to his downfall.
14:22:5/He also followed their advice and joined Jehoram, the son of Ahab king of Israel, in battle against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead, where the Syrians defeated Joram.
14:22:6/He returned to be healed in Jezreel from the injuries he received at Ramah during the battle with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram, the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was ill.
14:22:7/Ahaziah's downfall was orchestrated by God when he visited Joram. Upon his arrival, he joined Jehoram in battle against Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to eliminate the house of Ahab.
14:22:8/When Jehu was carrying out judgment on the house of Ahab and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers who served Ahaziah, he killed them.
14:22:9/They searched for Ahaziah, and after capturing him (he was hiding in Samaria), they brought him to Jehu. After killing him, they buried him because they said, "He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." Thus, the house of Ahaziah was unable to retain the kingdom.
14:22:10/But when Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son was dead, she rose up and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah.
14:22:11/However, Jehoshabeath, the king's daughter, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and rescued him from among the king's sons who were being killed. She placed him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus, Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest (since she was Ahaziah's sister), hid him from Athaliah so she did not kill him.
14:22:12/He was hidden with them in the house of God for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
14:23:1/In the seventh year, Jehoiada gained strength and formed an alliance with the captains of hundreds: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
14:23:2/They traveled throughout Judah, gathering the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the leaders of the families of Israel, and they went to Jerusalem.
14:23:3/The entire assembly made a covenant with the king in the temple of God. He told them, "The king's son will reign, as the LORD has promised concerning the descendants of David."
14:23:4/Here's what you need to do: A third of you, including the priests and Levites, who come on the Sabbath, will guard the doors;
14:23:5/Another third will be at the royal palace; and the last third at the Foundation Gate. All the other people will be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD.
14:23:6/But no one except the priests and serving Levites may enter the temple of the LORD, for they are holy. All the other people must observe the LORD's command.
14:23:7/The Levites will surround the king, each with his weapons in hand; anyone else who enters the temple will be put to death. Stay close to the king, whether he's coming or going.
14:23:8/So the Levites and all of Judah did everything Jehoiada the priest had ordered. They took their positions, both those coming in and those going out on the Sabbath, as Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed any of their groups.
14:23:9/Jehoiada the priest also gave the captains of hundreds spears, shields, and body armor that had belonged to King David and were stored in the temple of God.
14:23:10/He positioned all the people, each holding a weapon, from the south side to the north side of the temple, around the altar and the temple, to protect the king on all sides.
14:23:11/Then they brought out the king's son, crowned him, presented him with the decree, and proclaimed him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and declared, "Long live the king!"
14:23:12/When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she joined them at the temple of the LORD.
14:23:13/She saw the king standing by his column at the entrance, with the officers and trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, while musicians with their instruments led the celebration. Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"
14:23:14/Jehoiada the priest then brought out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them, "Take her outside the temple grounds, and anyone who follows her, kill with the sword." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death in the temple of the LORD."
14:23:15/So they seized her, and when she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, they killed her there.
14:23:16/Jehoiada then made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they would be the LORD's people.
14:23:17/After that, all the people went to the temple of Baal and demolished it. They smashed his altars and images to pieces and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
14:23:18/Jehoiada also assigned the responsibilities of the temple of the LORD to the priests and Levites, whom David had organized to offer the burnt offerings to the LORD, as prescribed in the Law of Moses, with joy and singing, according to David's instructions.
14:23:19/He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the temple of the LORD so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.
14:23:20/He then took the commanders of hundreds, the nobility, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and led the king down from the temple of the LORD. They entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne.
14:23:21/All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was peaceful after they had killed Athaliah with the sword.
14:24:1/Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.
14:24:2/Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD throughout the time Jehoiada the priest was alive.
14:24:3/Jehoiada found him two wives, and he had sons and daughters.
14:24:4/Afterward, Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD.
14:24:5/He assembled the priests and Levites and told them, "Go out to the towns of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair your God's temple annually. Make sure you do this quickly." However, the Levites did not act promptly.
14:24:6/The king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and asked, "Why haven't you demanded the Levites to bring in the tax from Judah and Jerusalem as instructed by Moses, the servant of the LORD, and as required by the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?"
14:24:7/For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had damaged the temple of God; and they had also used all the sacred objects of the temple of the LORD for the Baals.
14:24:8/Upon the king's order, they made a chest and placed it outside at the entrance of the temple of the LORD.
14:24:9/They issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the tax that Moses, the servant of God, had imposed on Israel in the wilderness.
14:24:10/All the leaders and the people were glad, and they brought their contributions and dropped them into the chest until it was full.
14:24:11/Whenever the chest was brought to the royal officials by the Levites and they saw there was a large amount of money, the king's secretary and the high priest's officer would come, empty the chest, and then return it to its place. This happened regularly, and they collected a great deal of money.
14:24:12/The king and Jehoiada allocated the funds to those doing the work on the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the temple of the LORD, as well as workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.
14:24:13/The workers labored, and the restoration work progressed under their hands. They restored God's temple to its original condition and strengthened it.
14:24:14/When the work was completed, they presented the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada, which was used to make articles for the temple of the LORD—articles for service and for burnt offerings, including pans and other gold and silver items. Burnt offerings were made in the temple of the LORD continuously throughout Jehoiada's lifetime.
14:24:15/But Jehoiada grew old and died full of years; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death.
14:24:16/They buried him in the City of David among the kings because of the good he had done in Israel for God and His temple.
14:24:17/After Jehoiada's death, the leaders of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and the king listened to them.
14:24:18/They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came on Judah and Jerusalem.
14:24:19/Yet God sent prophets to them to bring them back to Him; the prophets testified against them, but they would not listen.
14:24:20/The Spirit of God came upon Zechariah, son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, "This is what God says: 'Why do you disobey the LORD's commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has also forsaken you.'"
14:24:21/But they conspired against him and stoned him to death by the king's command in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.
14:24:22/Joash the king did not remember the kindness Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him but killed his son. As Zechariah died, he said, "May the LORD see this and call you to account."
14:24:23/At the end of the year, the army of Aram attacked. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the leaders of the people, and sent all the plunder to the king of Damascus.
14:24:24/Although the Aramean army came with only a few men, the LORD delivered a very large army into their hands because the people of Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their ancestors. Thus, they executed judgment on Joash.
14:24:25/After they had left him (for they left him severely wounded), his own officials conspired against him because of the murder of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him on his bed. So he died and was not buried in the tombs of the kings.
14:24:26/Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath the Ammonite, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith the Moabite.
14:24:27/Regarding his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the restoration of the temple of God, these are recorded in the commentary on the book of the kings. And his son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
14:25:1/Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
14:25:2/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but his heart wasn't fully committed.
14:25:3/Once his rule was established, he executed the servants who had murdered his father, the king.
14:25:4/However, he did not kill their children, following the law in the book of Moses, as the LORD commanded: "Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their parents; each person shall die for their own sin."
14:25:5/Amaziah also organized Judah, appointing leaders over thousands and hundreds according to their families, throughout all Judah and Benjamin. He counted those twenty years old and above, finding three hundred thousand select troops ready for battle, skilled with spear and shield.
14:25:6/He also hired one hundred thousand experienced warriors from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
14:25:7/But a man of God came to him and said, "King, do not let the Israelite army join you, for the LORD is not with Israel, especially not with the people of Ephraim."
14:25:8/"If you go ahead and fight, be strong for battle, but God will let you fall before the enemy. God has the power to help or to overthrow."
14:25:9/Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about the hundred talents I paid for the Israelite troops?" The man of God replied, "The LORD can give you much more than that."
14:25:10/So Amaziah dismissed the troops from Ephraim to go home, which made them very angry with Judah and they left in a rage.
14:25:11/Amaziah then courageously led his people to the Valley of Salt, where he defeated ten thousand men of Seir.
14:25:12/He also captured another ten thousand alive, took them to the top of a cliff, and threw them off, breaking them to pieces.
14:25:13/Meanwhile, the troops Amaziah had sent away, refusing them to join the battle, attacked cities in Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killing three thousand people and taking a lot of plunder.
14:25:14/After defeating the Edomites, Amaziah brought back the gods of the people of Seir, set them up as his own gods, worshiped them, and burned incense to them.
14:25:15/This angered the LORD, and He sent a prophet to Amaziah, who asked, "Why are you worshiping these gods that couldn't even save their own people from you?"
14:25:16/While the prophet was speaking, the king interrupted, "Did we appoint you as an advisor to the king? Stop, or you might get hurt." But the prophet stopped and said, "I know God has decided to destroy you because you've done this and haven't listened to my advice."
14:25:17/Then Amaziah, king of Judah, took advice and sent a challenge to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Let's meet face to face."
14:25:18/Joash, king of Israel, replied to Amaziah, king of Judah, with a parable: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild animal in Lebanon walked over the thistle and crushed it.
14:25:19/You're saying, 'Look, I've defeated Edom,' and now you're arrogant. Stay at home! Why provoke trouble that will only bring you and Judah down?"
14:25:20/But Amaziah wouldn't listen; it was God's will to hand them over to their enemies because they had sought the gods of Edom.
14:25:21/So Joash, king of Israel, advanced, and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, faced off at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
14:25:22/And Judah was defeated by Israel; everyone fled to their homes.
14:25:23/Joash, king of Israel, captured Amaziah, king of Judah, at Beth Shemesh, then brought him to Jerusalem and broke down a section of Jerusalem's wall, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a distance of four hundred cubits.
14:25:24/He took all the gold and silver, all the vessels found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the royal palace, and hostages, then returned to Samaria.
14:25:25/Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
14:25:26/The rest of the events of Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14:25:27/After Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they conspired against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish, but they sent assassins after him and killed him there.
14:25:28/They transported his body on horses and buried him with his ancestors in the city of Judah.
14:26:1/Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
14:26:2/He rebuilt Eloth and returned it to Judah, after the king passed away.
14:26:3/Uzziah was sixteen when he began to reign, and he ruled for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
14:26:4/And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, following everything his father Amaziah had done.
14:26:5/He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who had insight into the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.
14:26:6/He went out and fought against the Philistines, destroying the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod, and built cities around Ashdod and in Philistine territory.
14:26:7/And God supported him against the Philistines, the Arabians living in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.
14:26:8/The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah: and his fame spread even to Egypt; for he became extremely powerful.
14:26:9/Furthermore, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and strengthened them.
14:26:10/He also constructed towers in the desert and dug many wells, because he had a lot of livestock in the lowlands and on the plains. He had farmers and vine growers in the hills and in Carmel, for he loved agriculture.
14:26:11/Moreover, Uzziah had an army of warriors who went out to battle in groups, according to their count by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the command of Hananiah, one of the king's chiefs.
14:26:12/The total number of family heads among the valiant warriors was two thousand six hundred.
14:26:13/And under their command was an army of three hundred thousand seven thousand and five hundred, who fought with great power to support the king against the enemy.
14:26:14/And Uzziah supplied the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings for throwing stones.
14:26:15/He also created in Jerusalem machines designed by skilled inventors to be placed on the towers and the corners for shooting arrows and large stones. And his fame spread widely; for he was incredibly helped until he became powerful.
14:26:16/But when he became powerful, his pride led to his downfall: he sinned against the LORD his God by entering the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
14:26:17/And Azariah the priest followed him in, along with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD.
14:26:18/They confronted King Uzziah and said to him, "It's not your role, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but that of the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who are consecrated for this purpose. Leave the sanctuary, for you have trespassed, and this will not bring you honor from the LORD God."
14:26:19/Then Uzziah became angry, and while he was arguing with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the temple of the LORD, beside the incense altar.
14:26:20/And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there he was, leprous on his forehead. They hurriedly expelled him from there, and he himself rushed to leave because the LORD had struck him.
14:26:21/And King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death, living in isolation, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son took charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
14:26:22/The rest of the events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.
14:26:23/So Uzziah rested with his ancestors, and they buried him with his ancestors in the burial field that belonged to the kings; for they said, "He is a leper." And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
14:27:1/Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
14:27:2/And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, following all the practices of his father Uzziah, except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. Yet the people continued in their corrupt ways.
14:27:3/He built the upper gate of the temple of the LORD, and he constructed extensively on the wall of Ophel.
14:27:4/Moreover, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he constructed fortresses and watchtowers.
14:27:5/He also fought against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. The Ammonites paid him that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. This tribute was paid to him in the second and third year as well.
14:27:6/So Jotham became powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
14:27:7/Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, including all his wars and his deeds, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
14:27:8/He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
14:27:9/And Jotham rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
14:28:1/Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, unlike his ancestor David.
14:28:2/For he followed the practices of the kings of Israel and also made metal idols for Baal.
14:28:3/Moreover, he burned incense in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his children in the fire, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
14:28:4/He also offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
14:28:5/Therefore, the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram, who defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners, bringing them to Damascus. He was also handed over to the king of Israel, who inflicted a great defeat on him.
14:28:6/For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day, all of them valiant warriors, because they had abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14:28:7/And Zichri, a mighty warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the palace administrator, and Elkanah, second to the king.
14:28:8/The Israelites took 200,000 of their fellow Israelites captive, including women, sons, and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they brought back to Samaria.
14:28:9/But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army returning to Samaria and said to them, "Look, because the LORD, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hands. But you have killed them in a rage that reaches to heaven.
14:28:10/And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves. But aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?
14:28:11/Now listen to me and send back the captives you have taken from your fellow Israelites, for the LORD's fierce anger is upon you."
14:28:12/Then some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those returning from the battle.
14:28:13/And said to them, "You must not bring the captives here, for we already have sinned against the LORD. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce anger against Israel."
14:28:14/So the soldiers gave up the captives and the plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.
14:28:15/The men designated by name took the captives, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow Israelites at Jericho, the City of Palms, and then returned to Samaria.
14:28:16/At that time, King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
14:28:17/For the Edomites had come again, attacked Judah, and taken captives.
14:28:18/The Philistines also had raided towns in the foothills and the Negev of Judah, capturing Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there.
14:28:19/For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.
14:28:20/Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, but he troubled him rather than strengthening him.
14:28:21/For Ahaz took a portion from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the officials and gave it to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.
14:28:22/In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.
14:28:23/He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him, for he thought, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.
14:28:24/Ahaz collected the furnishings from the temple of God, cut them in pieces, shut the doors of the LORD's temple, and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
14:28:25/In every town in Judah he built high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his ancestors, to anger.
14:28:26/Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14:28:27/And Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city, in Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
14:29:1/Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
14:29:2/He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, following everything his ancestor David had done.
14:29:3/In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the LORD's temple and repaired them.
14:29:4/He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the eastern square,
14:29:5/And said to them, "Listen to me, Levites. Purify yourselves now and purify the temple of the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and remove all the impurities from the sanctuary.
14:29:6/Our ancestors trespassed and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned their backs on the LORD's dwelling place, and turned away.
14:29:7/They also closed the doors of the vestibule, extinguished the lamps, and stopped offering incense and presenting burnt offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
14:29:8/Therefore, the LORD's anger has been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of dismay, astonishment, and ridicule, as you can see with your own eyes.
14:29:9/Indeed, our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons, daughters, and wives have been taken captive because of this.
14:29:10/Now, I intend to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that His fierce anger may turn away from us.
14:29:11/My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in His presence, to serve Him, and to be His ministers and burn incense."
14:29:12/Then the Levites got up, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, from the Kohathites; from the Merarites, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel; from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
14:29:13/From the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14:29:14/From the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
14:29:15/They gathered their fellow Levites, purified themselves, and came as the king commanded, according to the word of the LORD, to cleanse the LORD's temple.
14:29:16/The priests entered the interior of the LORD's temple to cleanse it, and they brought out all the impurities they found in the temple of the LORD to the courtyard of the LORD's temple. The Levites took them to the Kidron Valley to dispose of them.
14:29:17/They began the purification on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the LORD's vestibule. They purified the LORD's temple in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month, they finished.
14:29:18/Then they went to King Hezekiah and reported, "We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for the bread of the Presence with all its utensils.
14:29:19/We have also restored and purified all the items that King Ahaz discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness. They are now in front of the LORD's altar."
14:29:20/Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the city officials, and went up to the house of the LORD.
14:29:21/They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. He instructed the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the LORD's altar.
14:29:22/So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Likewise, when they slaughtered the rams, they sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
14:29:23/They presented the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
14:29:24/The priests slaughtered them and made atonement with their blood on the altar to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
14:29:25/Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the LORD's temple with cymbals, lyres, and harps, as David, Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet had commanded, by the authority of the LORD through His prophets.
14:29:26/The Levites stood with David's instruments, and the priests with the trumpets.
14:29:27/Hezekiah ordered the burnt offering to be offered on the altar. As the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began, accompanied by the trumpets and the instruments David, king of Israel, had ordained.
14:29:28/The whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters played; all this continued until the burnt offering was completed.
14:29:29/When the offering was finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.
14:29:30/Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises joyfully and bowed down and worshiped.
14:29:31/Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD." So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were willing brought burnt offerings.
14:29:32/The total number of burnt offerings brought by the assembly was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs—all of these for a burnt offering to the LORD.
14:29:33/The consecrated items were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
14:29:34/But there were too few priests to skin all the burnt offerings, so their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until other priests had purified themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious in purifying themselves than the priests.
14:29:35/Also, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for each burnt offering. Thus, the service of the LORD's house was reestablished.
14:29:36/And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had prepared the people, for the work was done quickly.
14:30:1/Hezekiah reached out to all of Israel and Judah, and also sent letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the LORD's house in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover in honor of the LORD God of Israel.
14:30:2/The king, after consulting with his advisors and the entire assembly in Jerusalem, decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
14:30:3/They were unable to celebrate it at the usual time because the priests had not purified themselves in time, and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.
14:30:4/The plan received the king's and the entire assembly's approval.
14:30:5/Therefore, they issued a decree to be announced throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, inviting them to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover in honor of the LORD God of Israel, something they hadn't done according to the prescribed manner in a long time.
14:30:6/The couriers went out with letters from the king and his officials throughout all Israel and Judah, following the king's command, saying, "People of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to those of you who have escaped from the hands of the Assyrian kings.
14:30:7/And do not be like your ancestors and your kin who rebelled against the LORD, the God of their ancestors, leading to their ruin, as you can see.
14:30:8/Now, do not be stubborn like your ancestors; instead, submit to the LORD. Enter his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God so that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
14:30:9/For if you return to the LORD, your relatives and your children will find mercy before those who have taken them captive and will be able to return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate, and he will not turn his face from you if you return to him."
14:30:10/So the couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they were met with laughter and ridicule.
14:30:11/However, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
14:30:12/In Judah, God worked to unite them in following the command of the king and the officials, according to the word of the LORD.
14:30:13/A large crowd gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly.
14:30:14/They got up and removed the altars in Jerusalem, and all the incense altars were taken away and thrown into the Kidron Valley.
14:30:15/Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites felt ashamed, purified themselves, and brought burnt offerings to the LORD's house.
14:30:16/They took their positions as prescribed by the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood received from the Levites.
14:30:17/Because many in the assembly had not purified themselves, the Levites were responsible for slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone who was not ceremonially clean, to dedicate them to the LORD.
14:30:18/A large number of people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good LORD pardon everyone
14:30:19/who sets their heart on seeking God, the LORD, the God of their ancestors, even if they are not purified according to the rules of the sanctuary."
14:30:20/And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
14:30:21/The Israelites present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and priests praised the LORD every day with loud instruments dedicated to the LORD.
14:30:22/Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who showed deep understanding of the LORD. They ate the festival meals for seven days, offering peace offerings and confessing to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14:30:23/Then the whole assembly agreed to celebrate for another seven days, and they celebrated joyfully for another seven days.
14:30:24/For Hezekiah, king of Judah, provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, and the officials gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. A great number of priests consecrated themselves.
14:30:25/And the entire assembly of Judah, together with the priests, the Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the foreigners who came from the land of Israel, and those residing in Judah, rejoiced.
14:30:26/There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
14:30:27/Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people, and their prayer reached his holy dwelling place in heaven.
14:31:1/After completing all this, everyone from Israel who was present went to the cities of Judah. They destroyed the idols, cut down the sacred groves, and demolished the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had completely eliminated them. Then, all the Israelites went back to their own cities, each to their own property.
14:31:2/Hezekiah organized the duties of the priests and Levites, assigning each person according to their role, including those responsible for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, give thanks, and praise at the entrance of the LORD's dwelling.
14:31:3/He also set aside a portion of his own wealth for the burnt offerings, including those for the morning and evening, the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed festivals, as prescribed in the LORD's law.
14:31:4/Furthermore, he instructed the residents of Jerusalem to contribute to the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves fully to the LORD's law.
14:31:5/As soon as the order was given, the Israelites generously brought the firstfruits of their grain, wine, oil, honey, and all the produce of the fields; they also brought a tenth of everything in great abundance.
14:31:6/The people of Israel and Judah living in the cities of Judah also brought a tenth of their cattle and sheep, and a tenth of the sacred items dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them up in heaps.
14:31:7/They started forming these heaps in the third month and finished in the seventh month.
14:31:8/When Hezekiah and his officials saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and His people Israel.
14:31:9/Then Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps.
14:31:10/Azariah, the chief priest from the family of Zadok, replied, "Ever since the people began bringing their offerings to the LORD's house, we have had enough to eat with plenty to spare, because the LORD has blessed His people, and this large amount is what's left over."
14:31:11/Hezekiah then ordered that storerooms be prepared in the LORD's house, and they did so.
14:31:12/They faithfully brought in the offerings, tithes, and dedicated items. Cononiah the Levite was in charge, with his brother Shimei as his assistant.
14:31:13/Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah served as supervisors under Cononiah and Shimei's direction, following King Hezekiah and Azariah's orders, the official in charge of God's house.
14:31:14/Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was responsible for distributing the voluntary offerings made to God, the sacred gifts, and the most holy offerings.
14:31:15/Assisting him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the priestly cities, tasked with distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, both to the prominent and the lesser.
14:31:16/This included all males three years old and up who entered the LORD's house, providing them with their daily portion for their service according to their duties.
14:31:17/It applied to the priests listed by their ancestral houses and the Levites twenty years old and up according to their duties and divisions.
14:31:18/It also included all their children, wives, sons, and daughters—the entire community—since they were committed to purity in their sacred duties.
14:31:19/And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of the outskirts of their towns, in every town, men were designated by name to distribute portions to all the male priests and to all who were listed in the Levitical genealogies.
14:31:20/In this way, Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, doing what was good, right, and faithful before the LORD his God.
14:31:21/In every endeavor that he undertook in the service of God's house, in following the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart and was successful.
14:32:1/After these events, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, arrived and invaded Judah, laying siege to its fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself.
14:32:2/When Hezekiah realized that Sennacherib had arrived and was planning to attack Jerusalem,
14:32:3/He consulted with his officials and warriors about cutting off the water supply from the springs outside the city, and they supported his plan.
14:32:4/So many people came together and blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the area, asking, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?"
14:32:5/He also fortified himself, repaired all the damaged walls, built them up to the towers, added another wall outside, fixed up the Millo in the City of David, and produced a large number of spears and shields.
14:32:6/He appointed military commanders over the people, gathered them in the city square at the gate, and encouraged them with these words,
14:32:7/"Be strong and brave. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.
14:32:8/He has mere human strength, but we have the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people were inspired by the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.
14:32:9/After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his envoys to Jerusalem while he himself was laying siege to Lachish, along with all his forces, to Hezekiah, king of Judah, and to all the people of Judah in Jerusalem, saying,
14:32:10/"This is what Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing your confidence that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?
14:32:11/Is it not Hezekiah who misleads you, making you risk death by starvation and thirst, claiming, 'The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria'?
14:32:12/Hasn't the same Hezekiah removed his high places and altars, insisting that you worship before one altar and burn incense on it?
14:32:13/Don't you realize what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of those nations able to protect their lands from my power?
14:32:14/Which of all the gods of these nations that my ancestors completely destroyed could save their people from me, that your God should be able to save you from my hand?
14:32:15/So now, don't let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this, and don't believe him. No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save their people from my hand or the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God save you from my hand!"
14:32:16/And his envoys spoke even more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
14:32:17/He also wrote letters insulting the LORD, the God of Israel, and speaking against him, saying, "Just as the gods of the nations of other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."
14:32:18/Then they shouted loudly in the language of the Jews to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, trying to frighten them and disturb them so that they could capture the city.
14:32:19/And they spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of human hands.
14:32:20/Because of this, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven.
14:32:21/And the LORD sent an angel who annihilated all the valiant warriors, leaders, and commanders in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he returned in disgrace to his own land. When he entered the temple of his god, some of his own offspring killed him there with the sword.
14:32:22/In this way, the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from all other threats, and he protected them on every side.
14:32:23/Many brought offerings to the LORD in Jerusalem and valuable gifts to Hezekiah, king of Judah, so that from then on he was held in high esteem by all nations.
14:32:24/During that time, Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to the LORD, who responded to him and gave him a miraculous sign.
14:32:25/But Hezekiah did not respond with gratitude for the kindness shown to him; his heart became proud. Therefore, wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
14:32:26/However, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride in his heart, as did the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so the LORD's wrath did not come upon them during Hezekiah's lifetime.
14:32:27/Hezekiah accumulated great wealth and honor. He created treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable items;
14:32:28/He also built storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and pens for all kinds of livestock, and enclosures for flocks.
14:32:29/Besides, he acquired cities and had flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great wealth.
14:32:30/Hezekiah also redirected the upper watercourse of Gihon and channeled it directly to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah succeeded in everything he did.
14:32:31/However, regarding the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to inquire about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him, to know everything in his heart.
14:32:32/The rest of the events of Hezekiah's reign, including his acts of devotion, are recorded in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz, and in the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14:32:33/Hezekiah passed away and was buried in the most distinguished of the tombs of the descendants of David. All of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh, his son, succeeded him as king.
14:33:1/Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
14:33:2/But he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, similar to the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
14:33:3/For he rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars to Baal, made Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
14:33:4/He even built altars in the temple of the LORD, which the LORD had declared, "My name will remain in Jerusalem forever."
14:33:5/And he constructed altars for all the starry hosts in both courts of the temple of the LORD.
14:33:6/He made his sons pass through fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did a great deal of evil in the LORD's sight, provoking him to anger.
14:33:7/He placed a carved idol, the image he had made, in the temple of God, where God had told David and Solomon his son, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
14:33:8/I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I have commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees, and regulations given through Moses."
14:33:9/So Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, causing them to do worse than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
14:33:10/The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
14:33:11/Therefore, the LORD brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
14:33:12/In his distress, he sought the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors.
14:33:13/He prayed to him, and God was moved by his entreaty, heard his plea, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God.
14:33:14/Afterward, he built an outer wall for the City of David, west of Gihon in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate, encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it very high. He placed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.
14:33:15/He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the temple of the LORD, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city.
14:33:16/Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
14:33:17/However, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
14:33:18/The other events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
14:33:19/His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins, his unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself—all are written in the records of the seers.
14:33:20/So Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
14:33:21/Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
14:33:22/But he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and served all the idols his father Manasseh had made.
14:33:23/And unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the LORD; Amon increased his guilt.
14:33:24/His officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
14:33:25/But the people of the land killed all who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
14:34:1/Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
14:34:2/And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and followed the ways of his ancestor David, without turning aside to the right or to the left.
14:34:3/For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his ancestor David: and in the twelfth year he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherah poles, and the carved and cast images.
14:34:4/And they demolished the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the idols, that were placed high above them, he cut down; and the Asherah poles, and the carved and cast images, he smashed to pieces, turned them into dust, and scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
14:34:5/And he burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purified Judah and Jerusalem.
14:34:6/And he did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, with their tools all around.
14:34:7/And when he had torn down the altars and the Asherah poles, and had ground the carved images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
14:34:8/Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the temple of the LORD his God.
14:34:9/And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
14:34:10/And they put it in the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the temple of the LORD, and they paid it to the workmen who were working in the temple of the LORD, to repair and restore the temple:
14:34:11/They also gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let deteriorate.
14:34:12/And the men carried out the work faithfully: the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites from the descendants of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, from the descendants of the Kohathites, to supervise; and other Levites, all skilled in playing musical instruments.
14:34:13/They were also in charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers in any kind of service: and among the Levites there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.
14:34:14/And when they brought out the money that had been brought into the temple of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given through Moses.
14:34:15/And Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
14:34:16/And Shaphan brought the book to the king, and also reported to the king, saying, "Everything that was entrusted to your servants, they are doing.
14:34:17/And they have gathered the money that was found in the temple of the LORD and have handed it over to the overseers and to the workmen."
14:34:18/Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
14:34:19/And when the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes.
14:34:20/And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,
14:34:21/"Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found. For great is the anger of the LORD that has been poured out on us because our ancestors did not obey the word of the LORD, to do everything written in this book."
14:34:22/And Hilkiah and those the king had designated went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (she lived in Jerusalem in the Second District) and they spoke to her about this.
14:34:23/And she responded to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,
14:34:24/'This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its inhabitants—all the curses written in the book that was read before the king of Judah—
14:34:25/Because they have abandoned me and burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all the works of their hands, my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.'
14:34:26/But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, you shall say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says regarding the words you have heard:
14:34:27/Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and because you humbled yourself before me, tore your clothes, and wept before me, I have heard you, says the LORD.
14:34:28/Behold, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and its inhabitants.'" So they brought the message back to the king.
14:34:29/Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
14:34:30/And the king went up to the temple of the LORD, with all the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, from the greatest to the least. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the temple of the LORD.
14:34:31/And the king stood by his pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD and to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant written in this book.
14:34:32/And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge allegiance. The inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
14:34:33/And Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he made all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. Throughout his lifetime, they did not turn away from following the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
14:35:1/Furthermore, Josiah celebrated a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
14:35:2/He assigned the priests to their duties and motivated them for the service of the LORD's house,
14:35:3/And told the Levites who instructed all Israel and were dedicated to the LORD, "Place the holy ark in the temple that Solomon, son of David, king of Israel, built; it shouldn't be a burden on your shoulders: now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel,
14:35:4/And get ready according to your ancestral houses, following the instructions of David king of Israel, and Solomon his son.
14:35:5/And stand in the holy place as per the divisions of the families of your ancestors among the people, and according to the division of the Levite families.
14:35:6/So slaughter the Passover lamb, purify yourselves, and prepare your brothers so they may follow the LORD's instructions through Moses.
14:35:7/And Josiah provided for the people, from the flock, lambs and young goats, all for the Passover sacrifices, for everyone present, totaling thirty thousand, plus three thousand bulls: these were from the king’s own possessions.
14:35:8/And his officials generously contributed to the people, the priests, and the Levites: Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, leaders of God's house, gave the priests two thousand six hundred small livestock and three hundred oxen for the Passover sacrifices.
14:35:9/Conaniah, Shemaiah, Nethaneel, his brothers, Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, leaders of the Levites, provided the Levites with five thousand small livestock and five hundred oxen for Passover sacrifices.
14:35:10/Thus, the service was arranged, and the priests stood in their positions, and the Levites in their groups, as per the king's order.
14:35:11/And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, the priests sprinkled the blood they received, and the Levites skinned the animals.
14:35:12/And they arranged the burnt offerings to distribute them according to the family divisions of the people, to offer to the LORD as written in the book of Moses. They did the same with the oxen.
14:35:13/And they cooked the Passover lamb over fire as prescribed; but the other sacred offerings were boiled in pots, cauldrons, and pans, and quickly distributed among all the people.
14:35:14/Afterward, they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy offering burnt offerings and the fat until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
14:35:15/And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, following the commands of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate; they did not leave their duties because their fellow Levites prepared for them.
14:35:16/So all the service for the LORD was arranged that day, to celebrate the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as per the command of King Josiah.
14:35:17/And the Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
14:35:18/And no Passover like the one kept by Josiah had been celebrated in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel held such a Passover as Josiah did, with the priests, Levites, all of Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14:35:19/This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
14:35:20/After all this, when Josiah had restored the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him.
14:35:21/But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, "What conflict is between us, king of Judah? I have not come against you today but against a kingdom with which I am at war, and God has directed me to hurry. Stop interfering with God, who is with me, so he doesn't destroy you."
14:35:22/However, Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle, ignoring Necho's warnings from God, and went to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.
14:35:23/And archers shot King Josiah; and he said to his servants, "Take me away; I am badly wounded."
14:35:24/So his servants took him out of his chariot, transferred him to his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. And all of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
14:35:25/And Jeremiah mourned for Josiah, and all the male and female singers talk about Josiah in their laments to this day, and they established it as a tradition in Israel; and indeed, they are recorded in the Lamentations.
14:35:26/Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his acts of kindness, as written in the law of the LORD,
14:35:27/And his deeds, from beginning to end, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
14:36:1/Then the locals made Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, king in his father's place in Jerusalem.
14:36:2/Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he ruled for three months in Jerusalem.
14:36:3/The king of Egypt overthrew him in Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
14:36:4/The king of Egypt appointed Eliakim, his brother, as king over Judah and Jerusalem, changing his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz, his brother, and brought him to Egypt.
14:36:5/Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he started his reign, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem, doing what was evil in the eyes of the LORD his God.
14:36:6/Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, attacked him, captured him, and took him to Babylon in chains.
14:36:7/Nebuchadnezzar also took the sacred objects from the LORD's temple to Babylon and placed them in his temple there.
14:36:8/The rest of Jehoiakim's deeds, his detestable acts, and his wrongdoings are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. Jehoiachin, his son, succeeded him as king.
14:36:9/Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for three months and ten days in Jerusalem, doing what was evil in the LORD's eyes.
14:36:10/At the end of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, along with the precious objects from the LORD's temple, and made Zedekiah, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.
14:36:11/Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he started his reign, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.
14:36:12/He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke for the LORD.
14:36:13/He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, despite having sworn an oath by God. He became stubborn and hardened his heart, refusing to turn back to the LORD God of Israel.
14:36:14/Furthermore, all the leading priests and the people greatly sinned, following the detestable practices of other nations, and defiled the LORD's temple that had been consecrated in Jerusalem.
14:36:15/The LORD, the God of their ancestors, repeatedly sent his messengers to them because he had compassion on his people and his dwelling place.
14:36:16/But they mocked God's messengers, disregarded his words, and mistreated his prophets, until the LORD's anger against his people was so fierce that there was no remedy.
14:36:17/Therefore, he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in their holy temple, and showed no mercy to anyone, young or old, man or woman.
14:36:18/He took all the objects from God's temple, both large and small, the treasures of the LORD's temple, the treasures of the king and his officials, and brought them all to Babylon.
14:36:19/They set fire to God's temple, broke down the walls of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces, and destroyed all its valuable items.
14:36:20/Those who survived the sword were taken to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his descendants until the Persian kingdom took over.
14:36:21/This fulfilled the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths; during its desolation, it rested until the seventy years were completed.
14:36:22/In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in writing:
14:36:23/"This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever among you belongs to his people, may the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.'"
15:1:1/In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, to fulfill the prophecy spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD inspired Cyrus, king of Persia, to issue a decree throughout his entire kingdom, which he also recorded in writing, saying,
15:1:2/"This is what Cyrus, king of Persia, says: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has commanded me to build Him a temple in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
15:1:3/Who among you belongs to His people? May his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.
15:1:4/And anyone who remains in any place where he lives should support him with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, in addition to a voluntary offering for the temple of God in Jerusalem.
15:1:5/Then the leaders of the families of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites, along with all those whose spirits God had moved, rose to go up and build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem.
15:1:6/And all those around them bolstered their efforts with silver and gold, goods, livestock, and valuable gifts, in addition to all that was given freely.
15:1:7/Cyrus the king also returned the vessels of the temple of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and placed in the temple of his gods;
15:1:8/These, Cyrus king of Persia had brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
15:1:9/Here is the inventory: thirty gold dishes, a thousand silver dishes, twenty-nine knives,
15:1:10/Thirty gold bowls, four hundred and ten silver bowls of a second kind, and a thousand other articles.
15:1:11/All the gold and silver articles totaled five thousand four hundred. All these were brought up by Sheshbazzar, along with the exiles who were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
15:2:1/Here are the descendants from the province who returned from exile, those who Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken to Babylon and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to their own city;

15:2:56/The descendants of Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel,
15:2:57/The descendants of Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth of Zebaim, Ami.
15:2:58/All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants totaled three hundred ninety-two.
15:2:59/These are the ones who came up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they could not prove their families or lineage as being from Israel:
15:2:60/The descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two.
15:2:61/Among the priestly families were the descendants of Habaiah, Koz, Barzillai, who married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and took their name.
15:2:62/They searched for their records in the genealogical listings, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood as unclean.
15:2:63/The governor told them they could not eat from the most sacred offerings until a priest could consult the Urim and Thummim.
15:2:64/The total assembly numbered forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
15:2:65/Besides their seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven servants and maids, and they had two hundred singers, both men and women.
15:2:66/They had seven hundred thirty-six horses, two hundred forty-five mules,
15:2:67/Four hundred thirty-five camels, and six thousand seven hundred twenty donkeys.
15:2:68/Some of the family heads made voluntary offerings for the temple of God to help finance its reconstruction on its original site.
15:2:69/They contributed to the treasury for this work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments.
15:2:70/So the priests, Levites, some of the people, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants settled in their own towns, and all Israel in their towns.
15:3:1/When the seventh month arrived, and the children of Israel were in their cities, the people came together as one to Jerusalem.
15:3:2/Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, along with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, stood up and constructed the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as prescribed in the law of Moses, the man of God.
15:3:3/They placed the altar on its foundations; they were motivated by fear of the people from the surrounding regions: and they presented burnt offerings to the LORD, including morning and evening burnt offerings.
15:3:4/They also celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, following the instructions written down, and offered the daily burnt offerings in the prescribed numbers, fulfilling the daily requirements.
15:3:5/Then they offered the regular burnt offering, for the new moons, for all the designated feasts of the LORD that were set apart, and for everyone who voluntarily brought a freewill offering to the LORD.
15:3:6/From the first day of the seventh month, they began to present burnt offerings to the LORD, even though the foundation of the LORD's temple had not yet been laid.
15:3:7/They also paid the masons and carpenters; and provided food, drink, and oil to those from Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, in accordance with the permission granted by Cyrus, king of Persia.
15:3:8/In the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, along with the rest of their fellow priests and Levites, and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work. They appointed Levites, twenty years old and above, to oversee the work of the house of the LORD.
15:3:9/Jeshua, his sons and brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, stood together to supervise the workers in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons, and their Levite brothers.
15:3:10/When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they positioned the priests in their attire with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, following the practices established by David, king of Israel.
15:3:11/They sang responsively in praise and thanks to the LORD, proclaiming, "He is good, and His steadfast love toward Israel endures forever." And all the people raised a great shout of joy in praise of the LORD, celebrating the laying of the foundation of the house of the LORD.
15:3:12/However, many of the priests, Levites, and family heads, who were elderly and had seen the first temple, wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted aloud for joy.
15:3:13/The sound was so mixed that it was impossible to distinguish the joyful shouts from the sounds of weeping among the people: for the people shouted loudly, and the noise was heard from far away.
15:4:1/When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin found out that the exiles were rebuilding the temple for the LORD God of Israel;
15:4:2/they approached Zerubbabel and the leading elders and proposed, "Let us help you build because we seek your God just as you do; we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here."
15:4:3/But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leading elders of Israel told them, "You have no part with us in building a temple for our God; we alone will build it for the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us."
15:4:4/The local people then began to discourage the people of Judah and made them afraid to build,
15:4:5/and even hired advisors to work against them and thwart their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15:4:6/During the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they filed a formal complaint against the residents of Judah and Jerusalem.
15:4:7/And during the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic script and translated into Aramaic.
15:4:8/Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:
15:4:9/Then Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary, and their colleagues—the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
15:4:10/and the other nations whom the great and noble Osnapper deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates River.
15:4:11/This is a copy of the letter they sent to him, to King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men west of the Euphrates River.
15:4:12/Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring its walls and repairing its foundations.
15:4:13/Let it now be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, they will not pay tax, tribute, or duty, and the royal revenues will suffer.
15:4:14/Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not right for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,
15:4:15/so that a search may be made in the archives of your ancestors. In these records, you will find and learn that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and that sedition has been stirred up in it from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.
15:4:16/We want to make it clear to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, you will have no possession west of the Euphrates.
15:4:17/The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, to Shimshai the secretary, and to the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere west of the Euphrates, greetings.
15:4:18/The letter you sent us has been read in my presence.
15:4:19/I issued a decree and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of rebellion against kings and has been a hotbed of revolt and sedition.
15:4:20/It was also found that Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole region west of the Euphrates, and tribute, taxes, and duties were paid to them.
15:4:21/Therefore, issue an order for these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so command.
15:4:22/Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?
15:4:23/As soon as the text of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read to Rehum, Shimshai the secretary, and their associates, they hurried to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force.
15:4:24/Thus, the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15:5:1/Then the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, son of Iddo, delivered prophecies to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, directly to them.
15:5:2/Then Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, son of Jozadak, started to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem, with the prophets of God assisting them.
15:5:3/At that time, Tatnai, the governor west of the river, Shetharboznai, and their associates came to them and questioned, "Who gave you permission to rebuild this temple and restore this wall?"
15:5:4/We then asked them, "Can you tell us the names of the people working on this construction?"
15:5:5/But God was watching over the Jewish elders, preventing any interference until the issue was reported to Darius, and a written response was received.
15:5:6/The letter sent by Tatnai, the governor west of the river, Shetharboznai, and his associates, the Apharsachites, to King Darius was as follows:
15:5:7/They wrote a letter to him, which said: "To King Darius, greetings of peace."
15:5:8/Let it be known to the king that we visited the province of Judea and the temple of the great God, which is being built with large stones and timber in its walls. The work is progressing rapidly and is successful.
15:5:9/We then questioned the elders, asking, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and construct these walls?"
15:5:10/We also asked for their names to inform you, so we could record the leaders of this project.
15:5:11/They responded, "We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, rebuilding the temple that was constructed many years ago, a project initiated by a great king of Israel."
15:5:12/However, after our ancestors angered the God of heaven, He handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who demolished this temple and exiled the people to Babylon.
15:5:13/But in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, Cyrus himself issued a decree to rebuild this temple of God.
15:5:14/Also, the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, were returned by King Cyrus. He entrusted them to Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed as governor.
15:5:15/He instructed him, "Take these vessels, go, and place them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the temple of God be rebuilt on its original site."
15:5:16/Then Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the temple of God in Jerusalem. From that time until now, it has been under construction and is not yet completed.
15:5:17/Therefore, if it seems appropriate to the king, let a search be conducted in the royal archives in Babylon to verify whether a decree was indeed issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this temple of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his decision regarding this matter.
15:6:1/Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was conducted in the archives where the treasures were stored in Babylon.
15:6:2/In Achmetha, within the palace in the province of the Medes, a scroll was discovered, and it contained the following record:
15:6:3/In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus himself decreed concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be rebuilt as a place where sacrifices are made, and let its foundations be solidly laid; its height to be sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits;
15:6:4/With three layers of large stones and a layer of new timber; and let the costs be covered by the royal treasury:
15:6:5/Also, let the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and restored to their places in the temple in Jerusalem, and let them be placed in the temple of God.
15:6:6/Now therefore, Tatnai, governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shetharboznai, and your colleagues the Apharsachites who are west of the river, stay away from there:
15:6:7/Leave the construction of this temple of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this temple of God on its site.
15:6:8/Furthermore, I have issued a decree regarding what you are to do for the Jewish elders for the construction of this temple of God: ensure that the costs are fully covered from the royal treasury from the revenues of the region west of the river, so that the work is not delayed.
15:6:9/And provide them with whatever they need - young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem - without fail every day:
15:6:10/So they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
15:6:11/I have also decreed that anyone who changes this order shall have a beam removed from their house, be impaled on it, and their house shall be turned into a pile of rubble for this offense.
15:6:12/May the God who has chosen to dwell there destroy any king or people who attempt to change this decree or destroy this temple of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree; let it be carried out promptly.
15:6:13/Then Tatnai, governor west of the river, Shetharboznai, and their colleagues complied with what King Darius had ordered, and did so promptly.
15:6:14/And the Jewish elders continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
15:6:15/This temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15:6:16/And the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this temple of God with joy.
15:6:17/At the dedication of this temple of God, they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
15:6:18/They appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their groups for the service of God in Jerusalem, as written in the Book of Moses.
15:6:19/The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
15:6:20/For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. They slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.
15:6:21/And the Israelites who had returned from exile, along with everyone who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to worship the LORD, the God of Israel, ate the Passover,
15:6:22/And they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, because the LORD had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, strengthening their hands in the work on the temple of God, the God of Israel.
15:7:1/After these events, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
15:7:2/the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
15:7:3/the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
15:7:4/the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
15:7:5/the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:
15:7:6/Ezra left Babylon; he was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given. The king granted him everything he asked for, because the LORD his God was with him.
15:7:7/Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants, went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
15:7:8/He arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king's reign.
15:7:9/He began his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, because the gracious hand of his God was on him.
15:7:10/Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD, to practice it, and to teach its statutes and rules in Israel.
15:7:11/This is the text of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scholar of the words of the LORD's commandments and statutes for Israel:
15:7:12/Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.
15:7:13/I issue a decree that any of the people of Israel, their priests and Levites in my kingdom, who wish to go to Jerusalem with you, may do so.
15:7:14/Since you are being sent by the king and his seven advisers to investigate the situation in Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your hand,
15:7:15/and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15:7:16/along with all the silver and gold you can find in the entire province of Babylon, plus the freewill offerings of the people and priests, which are given willingly for the temple of their God in Jerusalem,
15:7:17/you are to use this money promptly to buy bulls, rams, lambs, grain offerings, and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
15:7:18/And whatever you and your fellow Israelites decide to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you can do in accordance with the will of your God.
15:7:19/The articles given to you for the service of the temple of your God, you are to deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
15:7:20/And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury.
15:7:21/I, King Artaxerxes, decree to all the treasurers in the region beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it is to be done promptly,
15:7:22/up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of oil, and salt without limit.
15:7:23/Everything commanded by the God of heaven must be carried out diligently for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
15:7:24/We also inform you that it is not permitted to impose taxes, tolls, or tribute on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or other workers at this house of God.
15:7:25/And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the region beyond the River, all who know the laws of your God; and teach anyone who does not know them.
15:7:26/Anyone who does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must be punished promptly, whether it be by death, banishment, confiscation of their goods, or imprisonment.
15:7:27/Praise be to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the king's heart to beautify the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem,
15:7:28/and who has shown me favor in the presence of the king, his advisers, and all the king's powerful officials. I was encouraged because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
15:8:1/Here are the main leaders of their families, and this is the family tree of those who came with me from Babylon during King Artaxerxes' reign.
15:8:2/From the descendants of Phinehas; Gershom. From the descendants of Ithamar; Daniel. From the descendants of David; Hattush.
15:8:3/From the descendants of Shechaniah, from the family of Pharosh; Zechariah, and with him were counted by genealogy 150 men.
15:8:4/From the descendants of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men.
15:8:5/From the descendants of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men.
15:8:6/Also from the descendants of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men.
15:8:7/And from the descendants of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men.
15:8:8/And from the descendants of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him 80 men.
15:8:9/From the descendants of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men.
15:8:10/And from the descendants of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men.
15:8:11/And from the descendants of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him 28 men.
15:8:12/And from the descendants of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men.
15:8:13/And from the last descendants of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men.
15:8:14/Also from the descendants of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them 70 men.
15:8:15/And I gathered them at the river that flows to Ahava; and we camped there for three days. I reviewed the people and the priests and found none of the descendants of Levi.
15:8:16/Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men; also for Joiarib, and Elnathan, men of insight.
15:8:17/And I sent them with instructions to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his fellow temple servants in Casiphia, to bring us ministers for the house of our God.
15:8:18/And because of our God's gracious hand on us, they brought us a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli, son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, 18 in total;
15:8:19/And Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, his brothers and their sons, 20 in total;
15:8:20/Also 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the officials had assigned to assist the Levites, all listed by name.
15:8:21/Then I declared a fast there, by the river Ahava, so we could humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for us, our children, and all our possessions.
15:8:22/For I was embarrassed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The hand of our God is favorably upon all who seek him, but his power and wrath are against all who forsake him."
15:8:23/So we fasted and pleaded with our God about this, and he listened to our plea.
15:8:24/Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,
15:8:25/And weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his lords, and all Israel present had offered.
15:8:26/I handed over to them 650 talents of silver, silver vessels weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
15:8:27/Also 20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two fine polished bronze vessels as precious as gold.
15:8:28/And I said to them, "You are sacred to the LORD, as are the vessels and the silver and gold, which are a voluntary offering to the LORD, the God of your ancestors.
15:8:29/Keep watch over them until you weigh them in the presence of the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD."
15:8:30/So the priests and the Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the utensils to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
15:8:31/Then we left the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.
15:8:32/And we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested for three days.
15:8:33/On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the utensils. Meremoth son of Uriah the priest was there, along with Eleazar son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui, the Levites.
15:8:34/Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time.
15:8:35/The exiles who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
15:8:36/They delivered the king's orders to the king's satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, who then supported the people and the house of God.
15:9:1/After all this was done, the leaders came to me and said, "The people of Israel, including the priests and Levites, haven't kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
15:9:2/They have taken their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so the holy lineage has mixed with the peoples of those lands. Indeed, the leaders and officials have led the way in this wrongdoing.
15:9:3/When I heard this, I tore my clothes and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down in shock.
15:9:4/Everyone who was appalled by the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there in shock until the evening sacrifice.
15:9:5/At the time of the evening sacrifice, I got up from my distress. With my clothes and cloak torn, I fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God,
15:9:6/And said, "Oh my God, I am too embarrassed and ashamed to lift my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached the heavens.
15:9:7/From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we, our kings, and our priests have been handed over to the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as is the case today.
15:9:8/But now, for a brief moment, grace has been shown from the LORD our God, who has left us a remnant to escape and given us a secure hold within his holy place, so that our God may brighten our eyes and give us a little relief in our slavery.
15:9:9/Even though we were slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our bondage. He has extended kindness to us in the presence of the kings of Persia, granting us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and giving us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
15:9:10/And now, our God, what can we say after this? We have disregarded your commands,
15:9:11/Which you gave through your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land you are entering to possess is a polluted land with the pollution of the peoples of the lands, with their detestable practices that have filled it from end to end with their impurity.
15:9:12/Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek their peace or prosperity, so that you may be strong, eat the good things of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.'
15:9:13/After everything that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and great guilt, and considering that you, our God, have punished us less than our sins deserve and have given us such a remnant,
15:9:14/Should we again violate your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit these detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving no remnant or survivor?
15:9:15/O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous. We are left as a remnant today. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.
15:10:1/When Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and throwing himself down in front of God's house, a very large crowd of men, women, and children from Israel gathered around him because the people were crying bitterly.
15:10:2/Shechaniah, son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, "We have sinned against our God by marrying foreign women from the local peoples, but there is still hope for Israel regarding this issue."
15:10:3/"So, let's make a promise to our God to send away all these wives and their children, following the advice of my lord and those who respect God's commandments; let's do it according to the law."
15:10:4/"Get up, because this task is yours to handle. We will support you, so be strong and take action."
15:10:5/Then Ezra got up and had the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel pledge to do what was proposed. And they took the oath.
15:10:6/Ezra then left the front of God's house and went to the room of Johanan, son of Eliashib. While there, he didn't eat bread or drink water because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
15:10:7/A call was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to gather in Jerusalem.
15:10:8/And it was announced that anyone who didn't show up within three days, as decided by the leaders and elders, would forfeit all their property and be excluded from the community of the exiles.
15:10:9/So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day, and all the people sat in the square in front of God's house, trembling because of the situation and because of the heavy rain.
15:10:10/Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have broken faith by marrying foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.
15:10:11/Now, confess to the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do what pleases Him. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."
15:10:12/Then the whole assembly responded loudly, "You're right! We must do as you say.
15:10:13/But there are many of us, and it's raining heavily. We can't just stand outside, and this isn't a matter that can be resolved in one or two days, for we have greatly sinned in this matter.
15:10:14/Let our leaders represent the entire assembly. Then, everyone who has married a foreign woman in our towns will come at set times, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God over this matter is turned away from us."
15:10:15/Only Jonathan, son of Asahel, and Jahaziah, son of Tikvah, were appointed to handle this matter, assisted by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.
15:10:16/The exiles did as proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them by name. On the first day of the tenth month, they sat down to investigate the cases.
15:10:17/By the first day of the first month, they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
15:10:18/Among the priests, there were found to have married foreign women: from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers; Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
15:10:19/They pledged to send away their wives, and as a guilt offering, they presented a ram from the flock.
15:10:20/From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
15:10:21/From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
15:10:22/From the descendants of Pashur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
15:10:23/Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also known as Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
15:10:24/Among the singers: Eliashib. And among the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
15:10:25/From the Israelites: from the descendants of Parosh; Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Miamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah.
15:10:26/From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah.
15:10:27/From the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
15:10:28/From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
15:10:29/From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
15:10:30/From the descendants of Pahathmoab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
15:10:31/From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
15:10:32/Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
15:10:33/From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
15:10:34/From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
15:10:35/Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,
15:10:36/Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
15:10:37/Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,
15:10:38/And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
15:10:39/And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
15:10:40/Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
15:10:41/Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
15:10:42/Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
15:10:43/From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
15:10:44/All these had married foreign women, and some of them had children with these wives.
16:1:1/The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it happened in the month of Chisleu, in the twentieth year, while I was in Shushan the palace,
16:1:2/That Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived, along with some men from Judah; and I asked them about the Jews who had survived, those who were left from the captivity, and about Jerusalem.
16:1:3/And they told me, "The survivors from the captivity in the province are in great trouble and disgrace: the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."
16:1:4/When I heard these words, I sat down and cried, and mourned for several days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
16:1:5/And said, "Please, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awe-inspiring God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love for those who love him and keep his commandments:
16:1:6/Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant, which I am praying before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have committed against you: both I and my father’s house have sinned.
16:1:7/We have acted very wickedly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which you commanded your servant Moses.
16:1:8/Remember, please, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations:
16:1:9/But if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them; even if your outcasts are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen to set my name.'
16:1:10/Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.
16:1:11/O LORD, please, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to revere your name: and please, make your servant successful today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.
16:2:1/In the month of Nisan, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, I was serving wine to him. I took the wine and gave it to the king. Until then, I had never appeared sad in his presence.
16:2:2/So the king asked me, "Why do you look so sad when you're not ill? This must be deep sorrow." I was terrified,
16:2:3/But I said to the king, "May the king live forever! How can I not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"
16:2:4/The king then asked me, "What is it you want?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.
16:2:5/And I answered the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors' graves, so I can rebuild it."
16:2:6/The king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you return?" It pleased the king to send me, so I set a time.
16:2:7/Then I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters for the governors of the region beyond the river, so they will provide me safe passage until I arrive in Judah?"
16:2:8/And a letter for Asaph, the keeper of the royal forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress near the temple, for the city wall, and for the residence I will occupy." And the king granted my requests, because the gracious hand of my God was on me.
16:2:9/So I went to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
16:2:10/When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.
16:2:11/When I arrived in Jerusalem, I stayed there three days.
16:2:12/Then, during the night, I set out with a few men. I hadn't told anyone what my God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me except the one I was riding.
16:2:13/That night, I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Dragon Spring and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.
16:2:14/Then I moved on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;
16:2:15/So I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and re-entered through the Valley Gate.
16:2:16/The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
16:2:17/Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace."
16:2:18/I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let's start rebuilding." So they began this good work with enthusiasm.
16:2:19/But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arabian heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you're doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"
16:2:20/I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will start building, but you have no share, legal right, or historic claim in Jerusalem."
16:3:1/Then Eliashib the high priest got up with his fellow priests, and they built the sheep gate; they dedicated it, and installed its doors; all the way to the tower of Meah they dedicated it, up to the tower of Hananeel.
16:3:2/And right next to him, the men of Jericho built. And next to them, Zaccur the son of Imri built.
16:3:3/However, the fish gate was built by the sons of Hassenaah, who also put in place its beams, and installed its doors, its locks, and its bars.
16:3:4/And right next to them, Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, made repairs. And next to them, Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel, made repairs. And next to them, Zadok the son of Baana made repairs.
16:3:5/And right next to them, the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles did not commit to the work of their Lord.
16:3:6/Also, the old gate was repaired by Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they put in place its beams, and installed its doors, its locks, and its bars.
16:3:7/And right next to them, Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, made repairs, up to the residence of the governor on this side of the river.
16:3:8/Next to him, Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. Next to him also, Hananiah the son of one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they strengthened Jerusalem up to the broad wall.
16:3:9/And right next to them, Rephaiah the son of Hur, the leader of half of Jerusalem, made repairs.
16:3:10/And right next to them, Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs, right across from his house. And next to him, Hattush the son of Hashabniah made repairs.
16:3:11/Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired another section, and the tower of the furnaces.
16:3:12/And right next to him, Shallum the son of Halohesh, the leader of half of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters.
16:3:13/The valley gate was repaired by Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and installed its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits on the wall up to the dung gate.
16:3:14/But the dung gate was repaired by Malchiah the son of Rechab, the leader of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and installed its doors, its locks, and its bars.
16:3:15/But the gate of the fountain was repaired by Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the leader of part of Mizpah; he built it, covered it, and installed its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king’s garden, and up to the stairs that go down from the city of David.
16:3:16/After him, Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the leader of half of Bethzur, made repairs, up to the area opposite the tombs of David, and to the pool that was made, and up to the house of the warriors.
16:3:17/After him, the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani, made repairs. Next to him, Hashabiah, the leader of half of Keilah, made repairs in his area.
16:3:18/After him, their brothers, Bavai the son of Henadad, the leader of half of Keilah, made repairs.
16:3:19/And next to him, Ezer the son of Jeshua, the leader of Mizpah, repaired another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the angle of the wall.
16:3:20/After him, Baruch the son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the angle of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16:3:21/After him, Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz repaired another section, from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib.
16:3:22/And after him, the priests, the men of the plain, made repairs.
16:3:23/After him, Benjamin and Hashub made repairs opposite their house. After him, Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made repairs beside his house.
16:3:24/After him, Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the angle of the wall, even to the corner.
16:3:25/Palal the son of Uzai, opposite the angle of the wall, and the tower projecting from the king’s upper house, that was by the court of the prison. After him, Pedaiah the son of Parosh.
16:3:26/Moreover, the temple servants lived in Ophel, up to the area opposite the water gate toward the east, and the projecting tower.
16:3:27/After them, the Tekoites repaired another section, opposite the great projecting tower, and up to the wall of Ophel.
16:3:28/Above the horse gate, the priests made repairs, each one opposite his house.
16:3:29/After them, Zadok the son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. After him, Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate, made repairs.
16:3:30/After him, Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. After him, Meshullam the son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.
16:3:31/After him, Malchiah one of the goldsmiths made repairs up to the area of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and up to the room above the corner.
16:3:32/And between the room above the corner to the sheep gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.
16:4:1/But it happened that when Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious, greatly insulted, and ridiculed the Jews.
16:4:2/He spoke in front of his brothers and the Samarian army, saying, "What are these weak Jews doing? Can they restore their walls? Will they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from the piles of rubble that have been burned?"
16:4:3/Now Tobiah the Ammonite was with him, and he said, "Even if a fox climbed on what they are building, it would break down their stone wall."
16:4:4/Hear us, O our God, for we are scorned: turn their mockery back on them and make them captives in a land of exile.
16:4:5/Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from your sight, for they have angered you in front of the builders.
16:4:6/So we continued to build the wall; and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, because the people were committed to the work.
16:4:7/But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls were progressing and the gaps were being closed, they were extremely angry.
16:4:8/They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and create confusion.
16:4:9/However, we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
16:4:10/And Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is failing, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."
16:4:11/Our enemies said, "They won't know or see anything until we're right among them, killing them and stopping the work."
16:4:12/When the Jews living near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us,"
16:4:13/So I stationed people in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in exposed places, and I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
16:4:14/Then I looked things over and stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awe-inspiring, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes."
16:4:15/When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work.
16:4:16/From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officials supported all the people of Judah,
16:4:17/who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon with the other,
16:4:18/And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
16:4:19/And I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.
16:4:20/Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us."
16:4:21/So we continued the work with half the men holding spears from the first light of dawn until the stars came out.
16:4:22/At the same time, I also said to the people, "Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so they can serve as guards by night and work by day."
16:4:23/So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, took off our clothes; each kept his weapon at his right hand, except when washing.
16:5:1/There was a loud outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.
16:5:2/Many said, "We have large families: we need to get grain so we can eat and stay alive."
16:5:3/Others said, "We've had to mortgage our lands, vineyards, and homes to buy grain because of the famine."
16:5:4/Some said, "We've had to borrow money to pay the king's tax, using our lands and vineyards as collateral."
16:5:5/Yet now, we are no different from our fellow Jews; our children are like theirs. Yet we are forced to enslave our sons and daughters, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved. We are powerless to help them, for others now own our lands and vineyards.
16:5:6/I was extremely angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.
16:5:7/So I thought it over and confronted the nobles and officials, telling them, "You are charging your own people interest!" Then I called a large meeting to deal with them.
16:5:8/I told them, "We have done our best to buy back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. And now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, unable to respond.
16:5:9/I also said, "What you're doing isn't right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?"
16:5:10/I and my brothers and my men could also claim money and grain from them, but let's stop charging this interest.
16:5:11/Please, give back to them today their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, and also the interest on the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil that you have been charging them."
16:5:12/They said, "We will give it back and will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials swear to do what they had promised.
16:5:13/I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!" The whole assembly said, "Amen," and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.
16:5:14/Moreover, from the time I was appointed as their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years—I and my brothers did not eat the food allotted to the governor.
16:5:15/But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God, I did not act like that.
16:5:16/Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
16:5:17/Furthermore, at my table were 150 Jews and officials, in addition to those who came to us from the nations around us.
16:5:18/Now what was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep, and birds, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. Yet with all this, I did not demand the governor's provisions, because the demands were heavy on this people.
16:5:19/Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
16:6:1/When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and our other enemies found out that I had rebuilt the wall without any gaps left in it (even though I hadn't yet installed the gates), 
16:6:2/Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message, suggesting we meet in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they were planning to harm me.
16:6:3/I sent messengers back to them, saying, "I'm working on a big project and can't come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?"
16:6:4/They kept sending me the same message four times, and I responded in the same way each time.
16:6:5/Then Sanballat sent his servant to me with the same message a fifth time, holding an open letter.
16:6:6/The letter claimed, "It's rumored among the nations, and Gashmu says it's true, that you and the Jews plan to rebel. That's why you're building the wall, and you aim to be their king, as the rumors say.
16:6:7/You've also supposedly appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem that there's a king in Judah. Now, these rumors will reach the king. So, let's meet and discuss this."
16:6:8/I sent back a message saying, "Nothing like what you're saying is happening; you're just making it up in your head."
16:6:9/They were all trying to scare us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it won't be completed." But I prayed, "Now, God, strengthen my hands."
16:6:10/Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah, who was confined to his home. He said, "Let's meet inside the temple and close the doors, because they're coming to kill you—at night, they're coming to kill you."
16:6:11/But I said, "Should someone like me run away? And who like me would go into the temple to save his life? I won't go in."
16:6:12/Then I realized that God hadn't sent him, but he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16:6:13/He was hired to intimidate me so I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would have something to use to discredit me.
16:6:14/My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to scare me.
16:6:15/So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
16:6:16/When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.
16:6:17/Meanwhile, during this time, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.
16:6:18/For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Johanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
16:6:19/They kept telling me about his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
16:7:1/When the wall was finished, and I had installed the doors, and assigned roles to the gatekeepers, musicians, and Levites,
16:7:2/I put my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the palace administrator, in charge of Jerusalem because he was a reliable man who revered God more than most.
16:7:3/I instructed them not to open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun was high in the sky; and even then, they should close and secure the doors while they stood guard. Also, I arranged for residents of Jerusalem to take turns on watch, each in front of his own home.
16:7:4/Although the city was large and spacious, there were few people living in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
16:7:5/God inspired me to assemble the nobles, officials, and common people to be registered by family. I found the family records of those who had first returned from exile and recorded them.
16:7:6/These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of those who had been exiled, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had taken away, and who came back to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city;
16:7:7/Among them were Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The total number of men from the people of Israel was as follows;
16:7:8/The descendants of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.
16:7:9/The descendants of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two.
16:7:10/The descendants of Arah, six hundred fifty-two.

16:7:15/The descendants of Binnui, six hundred forty-eight.
16:7:16/The descendants of Bebai, six hundred twenty-eight.
16:7:17/The descendants of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty-two.
16:7:18/The descendants of Adonikam, six hundred sixty-seven.
16:7:19/The descendants of Bigvai, two thousand sixty-seven.

16:7:22/The descendants of Hashum, three hundred twenty-eight.
16:7:23/The descendants of Bezai, three hundred twenty-four.
16:7:24/The descendants of Hariph, one hundred twelve.
16:7:25/The descendants of Gibeon, ninety-five.
16:7:26/The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred eighty-eight.
16:7:27/The men of Anathoth, one hundred twenty-eight.
16:7:28/The men of Bethazmaveth, forty-two.
16:7:29/The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty-three.
16:7:30/The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty-one.
16:7:31/The men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.
16:7:32/The men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred twenty-three.
16:7:33/The men of the other Nebo, fifty-two.
16:7:34/The descendants of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.
16:7:35/The descendants of Harim, three hundred twenty.
16:7:36/The descendants of Jericho, three hundred forty-five.
16:7:37/The descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty-one.
16:7:38/The descendants of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred thirty.
16:7:39/The priests: the descendants of Jedaiah, from the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy-three.
16:7:40/The descendants of Immer, one thousand fifty-two.
16:7:41/The descendants of Pashur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.
16:7:42/The descendants of Harim, one thousand seventeen.
16:7:43/The Levites: the descendants of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the descendants of Hodevah, seventy-four.
16:7:44/The singers: the descendants of Asaph, one hundred forty-eight.
16:7:45/The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, the descendants of Ater, the descendants of Talmon, the descendants of Akkub, the descendants of Hatita, the descendants of Shobai, one hundred thirty-eight.
16:7:46/The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, the descendants of Hashupha, the descendants of Tabbaoth,
16:7:47/The descendants of Keros, the descendants of Sia, the descendants of Padon,
16:7:48/The descendants of Lebanah, the descendants of Hagabah, the descendants of Shalmai,
16:7:49/The descendants of Hanan, the descendants of Giddel, the descendants of Gahar,
16:7:50/The descendants of Reaiah, the descendants of Rezin, the descendants of Nekoda,
16:7:51/The descendants of Gazzam, the descendants of Uzza, the descendants of Paseah,
16:7:52/The descendants of Besai, the descendants of the Meunim, the descendants of the Nephisim,
16:7:53/The descendants of Bakbuk, the descendants of Hakupha, the descendants of Harhur,
16:7:54/The descendants of Bazluth, the descendants of Mehida, the descendants of Harsha,
16:7:55/The descendants of Barkos, the descendants of Sisera, the descendants of Tamah,
16:7:56/The descendants of Neziah, the descendants of Hatipha.
16:7:57/The descendants of Solomon’s servants: the descendants of Sotai, the descendants of Sophereth, the descendants of Peruda,
16:7:58/The descendants of Jaala, the descendants of Darkon, the descendants of Giddel,
16:7:59/The descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pochereth of Zebaim, the descendants of Amon.
16:7:60/All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants totaled three hundred ninety-two.
16:7:61/These are the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their families or lineage as being from Israel:
16:7:62/The descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, the descendants of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.
16:7:63/Among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Koz, the descendants of Barzillai, who married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.
16:7:64/They searched for their records in the genealogical listings, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood as unclean.
16:7:65/The governor told them they could not eat from the most sacred offerings until a priest could consult the Urim and Thummim.
16:7:66/The entire assembly numbered forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
16:7:67/Besides their male and female servants, who numbered seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven. They also had two hundred forty-five male and female singers.
16:7:68/They had seven hundred thirty-six horses, two hundred forty-five mules,
16:7:69/Four hundred thirty-five camels, and six thousand seven hundred twenty donkeys.
16:7:70/Some of the heads of families contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred thirty priestly garments.
16:7:71/Some of the heads of families gave to the treasury for the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver.
16:7:72/And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty-seven priestly garments.
16:7:73/So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, settled in their towns. By the seventh month, the Israelites were in their own towns.
16:8:1/All the people came together as one in the street before the water gate; they asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had given to Israel.
16:8:2/Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, which included men, women, and all who could understand, on the first day of the seventh month.
16:8:3/He read from it in the street before the water gate from morning until noon, in front of the men, women, and those who could understand; and everyone listened attentively to the book of the law.
16:8:4/Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right side; and on his left side, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchiah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
16:8:5/Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people; (since he was above everyone;) and when he opened it, everyone stood up.
16:8:6/Ezra praised the LORD, the great God. And all the people responded, "Amen, Amen," lifting their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
16:8:7/Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites helped the people understand the law: and the people remained in their places.
16:8:8/So they read from the book of the law of God clearly, and explained it, helping the people understand the meaning.
16:8:9/Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them, "This day is sacred to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep." For all the people were weeping as they listened to the words of the law.
16:8:10/Then he said to them, "Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our LORD. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
16:8:11/The Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for this is a sacred day. Do not be sad."
16:8:12/And all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food, and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
16:8:13/On the second day, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe to study the words of the law.
16:8:14/They discovered in the law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month.
16:8:15/They were to announce and proclaim in all their towns and in Jerusalem: "Go out to the hills and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and other leafy trees to make temporary shelters—as it is written."
16:8:16/So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the house of God, and in the squares at the Water Gate and the Gate of Ephraim.
16:8:17/The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.
16:8:18/Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the book of the law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.
16:9:1/On the twenty-fourth day of this month, the people of Israel gathered together, fasting, wearing sackcloth, and with dust on their heads.
16:9:2/The people of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, stood up, and confessed their sins and the wrongdoings of their ancestors.
16:9:3/They stood in their places and read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day; for another quarter, they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God.
16:9:4/Then, the Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani—stood on the steps and called out to the LORD their God with loud voices.
16:9:5/Then the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, "Stand up and praise the LORD your God forever and ever: and may your glorious name be blessed, exalted above all blessing and praise."
16:9:6/You alone are LORD; you created the heavens, the highest heavens with all their stars, the earth and everything on it, the seas and all within them. You give life to everything, and the heavenly hosts worship you.
16:9:7/You are the LORD God, who chose Abram, led him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and named him Abraham.
16:9:8/You found his heart faithful before you, made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites to his descendants. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.
16:9:9/You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea.
16:9:10/You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his servants, and the people of his land, because you knew they were arrogant toward them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day.
16:9:11/You split the sea before them, so they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.
16:9:12/You led them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night to light the way they should go.
16:9:13/You came down on Mount Sinai, spoke to them from heaven, and gave them just laws, true teachings, good statutes, and commandments.
16:9:14/You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, statutes, and laws through your servant Moses.
16:9:15/You provided them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought water from a rock for their thirst. You promised them that they would enter and possess the land you had sworn to give them.
16:9:16/But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly, stiffened their necks, and did not obey your commands.
16:9:17/They refused to listen and failed to remember the wonders you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore, you did not abandon them.
16:9:18/Even when they made for themselves a cast image of a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you up out of Egypt,' and committed great blasphemies,
16:9:19/In your great mercy, you did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take.
16:9:20/You gave your good Spirit to instruct them, did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and gave them water for their thirst.
16:9:21/For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
16:9:22/You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan.
16:9:23/You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess.
16:9:24/So their descendants went in and possessed the land; you subdued before them the Canaanites, who inhabited the land. You gave the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with as they wished.
16:9:25/They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.
16:9:26/Yet they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies.
16:9:27/So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed, they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
16:9:28/But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before you. Therefore, you left them in the hands of their enemies so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies.
16:9:29/You warned them in order to turn them back to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands; they sinned against your ordinances, which if a person follows, they will live by them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked, and refused to listen.
16:9:30/For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. Yet they would not listen, so you gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples.
16:9:31/However, in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.
16:9:32/Now, our God, the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all the hardship seem trivial before you that has come upon us, our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
16:9:33/In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly.
16:9:34/Our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep.
16:9:35/Even in their own kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the vast and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil deeds.
16:9:36/See, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.
16:9:37/Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.
16:9:38/In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites, and our priests are affixing their seals to it.
16:10:1/Now those who made the agreement were Nehemiah, the governor, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,
16:10:2/Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
16:10:3/Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,
16:10:4/Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
16:10:5/Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
16:10:6/Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
16:10:7/Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
16:10:8/Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.
16:10:9/And the Levites: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
16:10:10/And their brothers, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
16:10:11/Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,
16:10:12/Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
16:10:13/Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.
16:10:14/The leaders of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,
16:10:15/Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
16:10:16/Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
16:10:17/Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,
16:10:18/Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,
16:10:19/Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
16:10:20/Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
16:10:21/Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,
16:10:22/Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
16:10:23/Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,
16:10:24/Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,
16:10:25/Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
16:10:26/And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
16:10:27/Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
16:10:28/And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all who had separated themselves from the people of the lands to follow the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone who had knowledge and understanding;
16:10:29/They joined with their fellow leaders and entered into a binding agreement to follow the law of God given through Moses the servant of God, to obey all the commands of the LORD our Lord, and his rules and statutes;
16:10:30/And that we would not marry our daughters to the people of the land or take their daughters for our sons;
16:10:31/And if the people of the land bring goods or any food to sell on the Sabbath, we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day. And we would forego the seventh year's produce and the cancellation of every debt.
16:10:32/Also, we agreed to impose on ourselves an annual tax of a third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;
16:10:33/For the bread set on the table, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering, for the Sabbaths, the new moons, for the appointed festivals, for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
16:10:34/And we cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people for the supply of wood to bring to the house of our God, according to our family divisions, at set times each year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God as it is written in the law.
16:10:35/And to bring the firstfruits of our soil and the firstfruits of all fruit from all trees, year by year, to the house of the LORD;
16:10:36/Also the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstborn of our herds and flocks, to bring to the house of our God, to the priests ministering in the house of our God;
16:10:37/And to bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit from all kinds of trees, the new wine and oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and to bring to the Levites the tithes from our ground, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all our agricultural towns.
16:10:38/And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites shall bring up a tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasury.
16:10:39/For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the contribution of grain, new wine, and oil to the chambers where the vessels of the sanctuary are, as well as the ministering priests, the gatekeepers, and the singers. And we will not neglect the house of our God.
16:11:1/The leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also drew lots, to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine parts lived in other cities.
16:11:2/And the people praised all the men who willingly offered themselves to live in Jerusalem.
16:11:3/These are the main leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah, everyone lived on their own property in their cities, including Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon's servants.
16:11:4/In Jerusalem lived some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin. From the descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalaleel, from the descendants of Perez;
16:11:5/And Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Colhozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, son of Shiloni.
16:11:6/All the descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty-eight brave men.
16:11:7/And these are the descendants of Benjamin; Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jesaiah.
16:11:8/And following him were Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty-eight.
16:11:9/And Joel son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah son of Senuah was second in charge of the city.
16:11:10/Among the priests: Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jachin.
16:11:11/Seraiah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, was the leader of the house of God.
16:11:12/And their brothers who worked in the house were eight hundred twenty-two: and Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashur, son of Malchiah.
16:11:13/And his brothers, leaders of the families, two hundred forty-two: and Amashai son of Azareel, son of Ahasai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer,
16:11:14/And their brothers, strong warriors, one hundred twenty-eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, son of one of the great men.
16:11:15/Also among the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hashub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni;
16:11:16/And Shabbethai and Jozabad, among the leaders of the Levites, were in charge of the external affairs of the house of God.
16:11:17/And Mattaniah son of Micha, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, was the lead in starting the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brothers, and Abda son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun.
16:11:18/All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four.
16:11:19/Furthermore, the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers who guarded the gates, were one hundred seventy-two.
16:11:20/And the rest of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each in his inheritance.
16:11:21/But the temple servants lived in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were in charge of the temple servants.
16:11:22/The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micha. From the descendants of Asaph, the singers were in charge of the service of the house of God.
16:11:23/For it was the king's command concerning them, that a specific portion should be for the singers, as due for every day.
16:11:24/And Pethahiah son of Meshezabeel, from the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king's advisor in all matters concerning the people.
16:11:25/And regarding the villages and their fields, some of the descendants of Judah lived at Kirjatharba and its surrounding villages, at Dibon and its villages, and at Jekabzeel and its villages,
16:11:26/And at Jeshua, Moladah, Bethphelet,
16:11:27/And at Hazarshual, Beersheba and its villages,
16:11:28/And at Ziklag, Mekonah and its villages,
16:11:29/And at Enrimmon, Zareah, Jarmuth,
16:11:30/Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, at Lachish and its fields, at Azekah and its villages. And they lived from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
16:11:31/The descendants of Benjamin from Geba lived at Michmash, Aija, Bethel, and their villages.
16:11:32/And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
16:11:33/Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
16:11:34/Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
16:11:35/Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
16:11:36/And among the Levites were divisions in Judah and in Benjamin.
16:12:1/Here are the names of the priests and Levites who accompanied Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16:12:2/Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16:12:3/Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16:12:4/Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,
16:12:5/Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
16:12:6/Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16:12:7/Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their relatives during Jeshua's time.
16:12:8/Also, the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who led the thanksgiving choirs, along with his relatives.
16:12:9/Additionally, Bakbukiah and Unni, their relatives, stood opposite them during the services.
16:12:10/And Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, and Eliashib fathered Joiada,
16:12:11/And Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua.
16:12:12/During Joiakim's tenure, the leading priests from the families were: from Seraiah's family, Meraiah; from Jeremiah's, Hananiah;
16:12:13/From Ezra's, Meshullam; from Amariah's, Jehohanan;
16:12:14/From Melicu's, Jonathan; from Shebaniah's, Joseph;
16:12:15/From Harim's, Adna; from Meraioth's, Helkai;
16:12:16/From Iddo's, Zechariah; from Ginnethon's, Meshullam;
16:12:17/From Abijah's, Zichri; from Miniamin and Moadiah's, Piltai;
16:12:18/From Bilgah's, Shammua; from Shemaiah's, Jehonathan;
16:12:19/And from Joiarib's, Mattenai; from Jedaiah's, Uzzi;
16:12:20/From Sallai's, Kallai; from Amok's, Eber;
16:12:21/From Hilkiah's, Hashabiah; from Jedaiah's, Nethaneel.
16:12:22/During the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the Levites were recorded as heads of fathers' houses; likewise, the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian.
16:12:23/The descendants of Levi, the heads of fathers' houses, were documented in the chronicles until the time of Johanan son of Eliashib.
16:12:24/And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their relatives opposite them, to praise and give thanks as prescribed by David the man of God, section opposite section.
16:12:25/Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub were gatekeepers guarding the storerooms at the gateways.
16:12:26/This occurred during the time of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and during the time of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.
16:12:27/For the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication joyfully with thanksgivings, singing, cymbals, lyres, and harps.
16:12:28/The singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,
16:12:29/Also from the house of Gilgal and the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
16:12:30/The priests and Levites purified themselves, and also purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
16:12:31/Then I led the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and organized two large choirs to give thanks. One group proceeded to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate.
16:12:32/And following them went Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah,
16:12:33/And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
16:12:34/Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
16:12:35/And some of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Michaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph,
16:12:36/And his relatives, Shemaiah, Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession.
16:12:37/At the Fountain Gate, opposite them, they went up the steps of the city of David on the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.
16:12:38/The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on the wall, along with half the people, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
16:12:39/And past the Gate of Ephraim, the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
16:12:40/So both choirs took their positions in the house of God. So did I, along with half the officials,
16:12:41/And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets,
16:12:42/And Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah.
16:12:43/On that day, they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced, so the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.
16:12:44/At that time, officials were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. From the fields of the cities, they were to collect the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites.
16:12:45/And they performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commandments of David and his son Solomon.
16:12:46/For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
16:12:47/And all Israel, during the times of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, provided for the singers and gatekeepers their daily portions. They also set aside the sacred portion for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated it for the descendants of Aaron.
16:13:1/On that day, they read from the book of Moses to the people; and it was found written that the Ammonite and the Moabite should never be allowed into the congregation of God;
16:13:2/Because they did not welcome the children of Israel with food and water, but instead hired Balaam to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
16:13:3/So, when they heard the law, they excluded from Israel all those of mixed ancestry.
16:13:4/Before this, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the storerooms of our God's house, had allied himself with Tobiah:
16:13:5/He had prepared a large room for him, previously used to store the grain offerings, the incense, and the temple vessels, as well as the tithes of grain, wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
16:13:6/But during all this time, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I had gone to the king. After some time, I asked the king for permission to return,
16:13:7/And when I arrived in Jerusalem, I learned about the wrong Eliashib had done for Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of God's house.
16:13:8/This greatly upset me, so I threw all of Tobiah's household goods out of the room.
16:13:9/Then I ordered the rooms to be purified, and I brought back into them the temple vessels, along with the grain offering and the incense.
16:13:10/And I noticed that the portions for the Levites had not been given to them, causing the Levites and musicians responsible for the service to abandon their duties and return to their fields.
16:13:11/So I rebuked the officials and asked, "Why is God's house being neglected?" Then I gathered them together and reinstated them to their positions.
16:13:12/Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storerooms.
16:13:13/And I appointed as treasurers over the storerooms Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, assisting them because they were considered trustworthy. Their responsibility was to distribute the supplies to their fellow Levites.
16:13:14/Remember me for this, my God, and do not erase the good deeds I have done for the house of my God and its services.
16:13:15/At that time, I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. I warned them on the day they sold food.
16:13:16/Merchants from Tyre who lived in the city were bringing in fish and all kinds of goods and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
16:13:17/Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing you are doing, desecrating the Sabbath day?
16:13:18/Didn't your ancestors do the same, and didn't our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you are adding to the wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath."
16:13:19/When the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I ordered the gates to be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I stationed some of my men at the gates to ensure that no load would be brought in on the Sabbath day.
16:13:20/So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.
16:13:21/Then I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will use force against you." From that time on, they did not come on the Sabbath.
16:13:22/And I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and show me mercy according to your great love.
16:13:23/In those days, I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;
16:13:24/And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod and could not speak the language of the Jews, but only the language of each people.
16:13:25/And I confronted them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair. I made them swear by God, "You shall not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves.
16:13:26/Didn't Solomon king of Israel sin because of such women? Despite his wisdom, foreign women led him into sin.
16:13:27/Should we then listen to you and do all this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?"
16:13:28/And one of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me.
16:13:29/Remember them, my God, for defiling the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
16:13:30/So I purified them from everything foreign and assigned duties to the priests and Levites, each to his own task;
16:13:31/And for the wood offering, at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, my God, for good.
17:1:1/It happened during the reign of Ahasuerus, (this Ahasuerus ruled from India to Ethiopia, over 127 provinces):
17:1:2/In those days, when King Ahasuerus sat on his throne in Shushan the palace,
17:1:3/In the third year of his reign, he hosted a banquet for all his officials and servants; the military leaders of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the governors of the provinces were in attendance:
17:1:4/He displayed the wealth of his magnificent kingdom and the splendor of his majesty for many days, 180 days to be exact.
17:1:5/When these days were over, the king held a banquet for all the people present in Shushan the palace, both important and less so, for seven days, in the garden courtyard of the king's palace;
17:1:6/The courtyard had white, green, and blue curtains, tied with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars: the couches were made of gold and silver, set upon a mosaic floor of red, blue, white, and black marble.
17:1:7/They served drinks in golden goblets, each one different from the other, and royal wine in abundance, as befits the king's wealth.
17:1:8/The drinking was without restraint; the king had ordered that everyone could drink as they pleased.
17:1:9/Queen Vashti also held a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.
17:1:10/On the seventh day, when King Ahasuerus was in high spirits from wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served him,
17:1:11/To bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown, to show off her beauty to the people and officials, for she was very beautiful.
17:1:12/But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by his eunuchs; therefore, the king became furious, and his anger burned within him.
17:1:13/Then the king consulted the experts who understood the times (for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment:
17:1:14/And next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king and ranked highest in the kingdom);
17:1:15/"What action should be taken according to law against Queen Vashti for not obeying the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?"
17:1:16/And Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the princes, "Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also all the princes and all the people in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
17:1:17/For the queen's behavior will become known to all women, causing them to look down on their husbands when they learn that King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.
17:1:18/This very day the noblewomen of Persia and Media who have heard about the queen's actions will say the same to all the king's officials, resulting in much contempt and anger.
17:1:19/If it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.
17:1:20/When the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout his vast realm, all women will respect their husbands, from the greatest to the least."
17:1:21/The proposal pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan suggested:
17:1:22/He sent dispatches to all the king's provinces, to each province in its own script and to every people in their own language, declaring that every man should be master in his own house and that this should be proclaimed in the language of every people.
17:2:1/After these events, when King Ahasuerus's anger had cooled down, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and the decree against her.
17:2:2/Then the king's attendants suggested, "Let beautiful young virgins be searched for the king:
17:2:3/And let the king appoint officials throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to bring all the beautiful young virgins to the palace in Shushan, to the women's quarters, under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the women, and let beauty treatments be provided for them:
17:2:4/And let the young woman who pleases the king become queen instead of Vashti." This idea pleased the king, and he followed through with it.
17:2:5/Now in the palace at Shushan, there lived a Jew named Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite;
17:2:6/Who had been exiled from Jerusalem with the captives taken with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had exiled.
17:2:7/He was raising Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter, because she had no father or mother. The young woman was lovely and beautiful. When her parents died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.
17:2:8/So when the king's command and decree were proclaimed, and many young women were brought to the palace in Shushan under the care of Hegai, Esther was also taken to the king's palace and placed under the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.
17:2:9/Esther won his favor and kindness, and he quickly provided her with her beauty treatments and special food, and assigned her seven maids from the king's palace. He moved her and her maids into the best place in the women's quarters.
17:2:10/Esther had not revealed her nationality or family background, because Mordecai had instructed her not to.
17:2:11/Mordecai walked back and forth near the courtyard of the women's quarters every day to find out how Esther was doing and what was happening to her.
17:2:12/When it was each young woman's turn to go to King Ahasuerus, after she had completed twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women (six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics),
17:2:13/She would go to the king in this way: whatever she desired was given to her to take with her from the women's quarters to the king's palace.
17:2:14/In the evening she would go, and in the morning she would return to the second women's quarters, under the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
17:2:15/When it was Esther's turn, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the women, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.
17:2:16/So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
17:2:17/And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won his grace and favor more than all the virgins; so he placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
17:2:18/Then the king threw a great banquet for all his officials and servants—it was Esther's banquet. He also declared a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.
17:2:19/When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
17:2:20/Esther had still not revealed her family background or her ethnicity, as Mordecai had instructed her. She followed Mordecai's orders just as she did when she was under his care.
17:2:21/At that time, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17:2:22/But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.
17:2:23/When the affair was investigated and found to be true, the two officers were hanged on a gallows. And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.
17:3:1/After these events, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, elevating him and placing his seat above all the other princes.
17:3:2/All the king's servants at the king's gate bowed and showed respect to Haman, as the king had commanded. But Mordecai did not bow or show him respect.
17:3:3/Then the king's servants at the gate asked Mordecai, "Why are you disobeying the king's command?"
17:3:4/When they questioned him day after day and he did not listen to them, they told Haman to see if Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated since he had told them he was a Jew.
17:3:5/And when Haman noticed that Mordecai did not bow or show him respect, he was filled with anger.
17:3:6/But he scorned the idea of laying hands on Mordecai alone; after learning about Mordecai's people, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews throughout the entire kingdom of Ahasuerus, Mordecai's people.
17:3:7/In the first month, Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot) before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, until the twelfth month, Adar.
17:3:8/And Haman told King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king's laws. Therefore, it is not in the king's interest to tolerate them.
17:3:9/"If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the officials to bring into the king's treasuries."
17:3:10/And the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
17:3:11/Then the king said to Haman, "The money is given to you, and the people, to do with them as you see fit."
17:3:12/On the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's scribes were summoned, and a decree was written as Haman commanded to the king's satraps, the governors of every province, and the officials of every people, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring.
17:3:13/The letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill, and annihilate all Jews, young and old, children and women, on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions.
17:3:14/A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was made public to all the peoples, so that they would be ready for that day.
17:3:15/The couriers went out, spurred on by the king's command, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
17:4:1/When Mordecai realized everything that had happened, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, crying loudly and bitterly.
17:4:2/And he went as far as the king's gate because no one was allowed to enter the king's gate wearing sackcloth.
17:4:3/In every province, wherever the king's command and decree reached, there was deep mourning among the Jews, with fasting, crying, and lamenting; and many wore sackcloth and ashes.
17:4:4/So when Esther's maids and eunuchs told her, the queen was deeply distressed; she sent clothes to dress Mordecai and to remove his sackcloth, but he did not accept them.
17:4:5/Then Esther summoned Hatach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to find out what was happening and why.
17:4:6/So Hatach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king's gate.
17:4:7/And Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries to have the Jews destroyed.
17:4:8/He also gave him a copy of the decree issued in Susa for their destruction to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told her to go to the king to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.
17:4:9/And Hatach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
17:4:10/Again Esther spoke to Hatach and gave him a message for Mordecai:
17:4:11/Everyone in the king's service and the people of the king's provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned, the penalty is death, unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their life. But it has been thirty days since I was called to go to the king.
17:4:12/And they relayed Esther's words to Mordecai.
17:4:13/Then Mordecai sent back this reply to Esther: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house, you alone of all the Jews will escape.
17:4:14/For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?"
17:4:15/Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
17:4:16/"Go, gather all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish."
17:4:17/So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.
17:5:1/On the third day, Esther put on her royal clothes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, facing the king's residence. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, facing the entrance.
17:5:2/When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won his favor. He extended to Esther the golden scepter in his hand. So, Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.
17:5:3/The king then asked her, "What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? It will be granted to you, even up to half of the kingdom."
17:5:4/Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, I would like the king and Haman to join me today at a banquet I have prepared for them."
17:5:5/The king said, "Hurry and get Haman, so he can do as Esther has requested." So, the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17:5:6/At the wine banquet, the king asked Esther, "What is your wish? It will be granted. What is your request? Even up to half of the kingdom, it will be fulfilled."
17:5:7/Then Esther answered, "My wish and my request is;
17:5:8/If I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to another banquet I will prepare for them tomorrow, and then I will answer the king's question."
17:5:9/Haman left that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate, who didn't stand or move for him, he was filled with anger towards Mordecai.
17:5:10/However, Haman controlled himself and went home. He then summoned his friends and his wife Zeresh.
17:5:11/Haman boasted about his vast wealth, his many children, all the ways the king had honored him, and how he had been promoted above the other nobles and servants.
17:5:12/Furthermore, Haman said, "Even Queen Esther let no one but me join the king at the banquet she had prepared. And tomorrow, I am invited by her along with the king."
17:5:13/Yet all this means nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17:5:14/Then Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends suggested, "Have a gallows built, seventy-five feet high, and tomorrow ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then you can go happily with the king to the banquet." This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows built.
17:6:1/That night, the king couldn't sleep, so he ordered the book of records, the chronicles, to be brought and read to him.
17:6:2/It was discovered that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains and doorkeepers, who had plotted against King Ahasuerus.
17:6:3/The king asked, "What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?" The king's servants replied, "Nothing has been done for him."
17:6:4/The king then asked, "Who is in the court?" At that moment, Haman had arrived in the outer court of the king's palace, intending to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared.
17:6:5/The king's servants told him, "Haman is standing in the court." The king said, "Let him come in."
17:6:6/So Haman entered. The king asked him, "What should be done for the man the king wishes to honor?" Haman thought to himself, "Who would the king want to honor more than me?"
17:6:7/And Haman answered the king, "For the man the king wishes to honor,
17:6:8/let royal robes be brought, which the king himself wears, and the horse the king rides, adorned with a royal crown,
17:6:9/and let these robes and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble officials. Let them dress the man the king wishes to honor, and parade him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'This is what is done for the man the king wishes to honor!'"
17:6:10/Then the king told Haman, "Hurry, take the robes and the horse as you've suggested, and do exactly that for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Don't leave out anything you've mentioned."
17:6:11/Haman took the robes and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming, "This is what is done for the man the king wishes to honor!"
17:6:12/Afterward, Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman rushed home, distraught and with his head covered.
17:6:13/Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened. His advisors and Zeresh his wife said to him, "If Mordecai is of Jewish descent, whom you have started to fall before, you won't overcome him but will surely fall before him."
17:6:14/While they were still talking with him, the king's chamberlains arrived and hurried to take Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17:7:1/So the king and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther.
17:7:2/And the king asked Esther again on the second day during the wine banquet, "What do you wish for, Queen Esther? It will be given to you. And what is your request? It will be fulfilled, up to half of the kingdom."
17:7:3/Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have won your favor, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be spared as my plea, and let my people be saved as my request:
17:7:4/Because my people and I have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and eliminated. If we had only been sold as slaves, I would have remained silent, even though the enemy could never compensate for the king’s loss."
17:7:5/Then King Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who would dare to do such a thing?"
17:7:6/And Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman." Then Haman was terrified in the presence of the king and queen.
17:7:7/And the king, in his anger, left the wine banquet for the palace garden: and Haman stood up to beg Queen Esther for his life; for he realized that the king had decided his doom.
17:7:8/Then the king came back from the palace garden to the wine banquet area; and found Haman had fallen onto the couch where Esther was. Then the king exclaimed, "Will he even assault the queen right here in front of me in the palace?" As soon as the words left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
17:7:9/And Harbonah, one of the attendants, said to the king, "Look, there are the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had built for Mordecai, who had spoken well on behalf of the king, standing at Haman's house." Then the king ordered, "Hang him on it."
17:7:10/So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s anger was calmed.
17:8:1/On that day, King Ahasuerus gave Esther the queen the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai was presented to the king because Esther had revealed his relationship to her.
17:8:2/And the king removed his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. Esther then appointed Mordecai over Haman's estate.
17:8:3/Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, and tearfully pleaded with him to undo the harmful plans Haman the Agagite had devised against the Jews.
17:8:4/Then the king extended the golden scepter towards Esther. So Esther got up and stood before the king,
17:8:5/And said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor with him, if this proposal seems right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be issued to counteract the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews in all the king’s provinces:
17:8:6/For how can I bear to witness the calamity that will befall my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?"
17:8:7/Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I have given Esther the estate of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he attacked the Jews.
17:8:8/Now write on behalf of the Jews as you see fit, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring: for a document written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s ring cannot be revoked."
17:8:9/At that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day, the king’s scribes were summoned. They wrote all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces in total, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, as well as to the Jews in their script and language.
17:8:10/He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed the letters with the king’s ring, and sent them by mounted couriers on horses and riding on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:
17:8:11/In these letters, the king permitted the Jews in every city to unite and defend their lives, to destroy, kill, and annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, including their children and women, and to plunder their possessions,
17:8:12/On a single day across all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
17:8:13/The content of the decree was made public in every province, informing all the people so that the Jews would be ready on that day to take revenge on their enemies.
17:8:14/The couriers, mounted on mules and camels, went out in haste and urgency by the king’s command. And the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.
17:8:15/And Mordecai left the king's presence in royal garments of blue and white, with a large gold crown and a cloak of fine linen and purple. And the city of Susa erupted in joy and celebration.
17:8:16/The Jews experienced relief, happiness, joy, and honor.
17:8:17/And in every province and every city, wherever the king’s command and his decree reached, the Jews celebrated with joy and gladness, feasting and observing a holiday. And many people of the land became Jews because the fear of the Jews had seized them.
17:9:1/Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s command and his decree were about to be carried out, on the day the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them, it turned out the opposite, with the Jews gaining control over those who despised them.
17:9:2/The Jews came together in their cities across all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to defend themselves against those who sought to harm them: and no one could stand against them; for fear of them spread among all the people.
17:9:3/And all the provincial governors, the lieutenants, the deputies, and the king's officials supported the Jews; because they were afraid of Mordecai.
17:9:4/For Mordecai was highly regarded in the royal palace, and his reputation spread throughout all the provinces: for Mordecai's influence continued to grow.
17:9:5/So the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and annihilating them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.
17:9:6/And in the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and annihilated five hundred men.
17:9:7/And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
17:9:8/And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
17:9:9/And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
17:9:10/The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the adversary of the Jews, they killed; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17:9:11/On that day the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king.
17:9:12/And the king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and annihilated five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including Haman’s ten sons; what have they done in the rest of the provinces? Now, what is your request? It will be given to you. What is your further wish? It will be fulfilled."
17:9:13/Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, allow the Jews in Susa to do tomorrow as they have done today, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
17:9:14/And the king ordered this to be done: a decree was issued in Susa, and Haman’s ten sons were hanged.
17:9:15/The Jews in Susa came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not take the plunder.
17:9:16/But the other Jews throughout the king’s provinces also gathered to defend their lives and gained relief from their enemies, killing seventy-five thousand of their foes, but they did not take the plunder,
17:9:17/On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17:9:18/But the Jews in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and on the fifteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17:9:19/Therefore, the Jews in the rural areas, living in unwalled towns, celebrated the fourteenth day of the month Adar with joy and feasting, a festive day, and by sending gifts of food to one another.
17:9:20/And Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, near and far,
17:9:21/To establish among them that they should celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar every year,
17:9:22/As the days when the Jews gained relief from their enemies, and the month which was transformed for them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a festive day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending gifts of food to one another, and presents to the poor.
17:9:23/And the Jews committed to continue as they had started, and as Mordecai had written to them;
17:9:24/Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is, the lot) to crush and to destroy them;
17:9:25/But when Esther approached the king, he issued a decree that Haman’s wicked scheme against the Jews should come back on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
17:9:26/Therefore, they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Hence, because of all the words of this letter, what they had experienced in this matter, and what had happened to them,
17:9:27/The Jews established and took it upon themselves, their descendants, and all who would join them, without fail to celebrate these two days according to the written instructions and at the appointed time every year.
17:9:28/And that these days should be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, in every family, province, and city; and that these days of Purim should never cease among the Jews, nor the memory of them fade from their descendants.
17:9:29/Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.
17:9:30/And he sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
17:9:31/To establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning the observance of fasting and lamentation.
17:9:32/And Esther’s decree confirmed these practices of Purim; and it was recorded in writing.
17:10:1/King Ahasuerus imposed taxes on the land and the islands of the sea.
17:10:2/All the records of his power and might, and the story of how Mordecai was honored, are they not documented in the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
17:10:3/Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, held in high esteem among the Jews, favored by many of his people, working for their prosperity, and promoting peace for all his descendants.
18:1:1/There was a man in the land of Uz, named Job; this man was flawless and honest, someone who respected God and avoided evil.
18:1:2/He had seven sons and three daughters.
18:1:3/He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys, along with a very large household; making him the most prominent man in the east.
18:1:4/His sons would hold feasts in their homes on their respective birthdays; they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18:1:5/When the feast days cycled through, Job would purify them, getting up early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular practice.
18:1:6/Then there came a day when the angels presented themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
18:1:7/The LORD asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."
18:1:8/Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
18:1:9/Satan replied to the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
18:1:10/Haven't you protected him, his household, and everything he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
18:1:11/But now, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
18:1:12/And the LORD said to Satan, "Very well, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself, do not lay a finger." So Satan left the presence of the LORD.
18:1:13/One day when his sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
18:1:14/A messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
18:1:15/And the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."
18:1:16/While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."
18:1:17/While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."
18:1:18/While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
18:1:19/When suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."
18:1:20/Then Job stood up, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell to the ground, and worshipped,
18:1:21/And said, "I came into this world with nothing, and I will leave with nothing. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
18:1:22/Through all this, Job did not sin or blame God for anything.
18:2:1/Once again, there was a day when the sons of God gathered to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
18:2:2/And the LORD asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan replied to the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."
18:2:3/Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There's no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and avoids evil. And yet he still clings to his integrity, even though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
18:2:4/Satan responded to the LORD, "A person will give everything they have for their own life.
18:2:5/But now, stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
18:2:6/And the LORD said to Satan, "Very well, he is in your power; but you must spare his life."
18:2:7/So Satan left the LORD's presence and inflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
18:2:8/Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.
18:2:9/Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold on to your integrity? Curse God and die."
18:2:10/But he replied to her, "You're talking like a foolish woman. Should we accept good from God and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin with his words.
18:2:11/When Job’s three friends heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they each came from their own homes; Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They had agreed to come together to sympathize with him and comfort him.
18:2:12/When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, tearing their robes and throwing dust into the air over their heads.
18:2:13/They sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, and no one said a word to him because they saw how great his suffering was.
18:3:1/After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.
18:3:2/And Job spoke, saying,
18:3:3/May the day I was born perish, and the night when it was announced, 'A boy is conceived.'
18:3:4/Let that day turn to darkness; may God above ignore it, and no light shine on it.
18:3:5/May darkness and the shadow of death claim it; may clouds linger over it; may the terror of darkness frighten it.
18:3:6/As for that night, may darkness take it away; let it not join the days of the year or be counted among the months.
18:3:7/May that night be utterly lonely, with no sounds of joy within it.
18:3:8/Let those who curse days curse it, those who are skilled in rousing Leviathan.
18:3:9/May the stars of its twilight be dim; may it hope for light but find none, nor see the first rays of dawn.
18:3:10/Because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
18:3:11/Why didn't I die at birth, expire as I came from the womb?
18:3:12/Why were there knees to receive me, or breasts for me to nurse?
18:3:13/For now, I would be lying in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
18:3:14/With kings and counselors of the earth who built ruins for themselves,
18:3:15/Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18:3:16/Or I would have been like a stillborn child, like infants who never saw the light.
18:3:17/There, the wicked stop causing trouble, and the weary find rest.
18:3:18/There, the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
18:3:19/The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.
18:3:20/Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
18:3:21/To those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasures,
18:3:22/Who are overjoyed and rejoice when they find the grave?
18:3:23/Why is light given to a man whose path is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18:3:24/For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings pour out like water.
18:3:25/For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has happened to me.
18:3:26/I was not at peace, nor was I quiet; I had no rest, yet trouble came.
18:4:1/Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
18:4:2/If we try to talk with you, will you be upset? But who can keep from speaking?
18:4:3/Look, you've taught many people, and you've given strength to weak hands.
18:4:4/Your words have supported those who were falling, and you've made weak knees strong.
18:4:5/But now it's happening to you, and you're discouraged; it affects you, and you're distressed.
18:4:6/Isn't this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the integrity of your ways?
18:4:7/Remember, please, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever destroyed?
18:4:8/As I've seen, those who do wrong and sow evil, reap the same.
18:4:9/By God's blast they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils they are consumed.
18:4:10/The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
18:4:11/The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the strong lion's cubs are scattered.
18:4:12/Now a message was secretly brought to me, and my ear caught a whisper of it.
18:4:13/In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on people,
18:4:14/Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
18:4:15/Then a spirit glided past my face; the hair on my body stood up.
18:4:16/It stood still, but I couldn't make out its appearance. A form was before my eyes, there was silence, and then I heard a voice saying,
18:4:17/Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
18:4:18/Behold, he doesn't trust his servants; and he charges his angels with error.
18:4:19/How much less those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed more easily than a moth?
18:4:20/They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish forever without anyone noticing.
18:4:21/Doesn't their dignity depart from them? They die, even without wisdom.
18:5:1/Go ahead, call out; is there anyone who will answer you? Which of the holy ones will you turn to?
18:5:2/Anger kills the foolish, and jealousy destroys the naive.
18:5:3/I've seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I condemned their home.
18:5:4/Their children are far from safety, crushed without anyone to rescue them.
18:5:5/The hungry consume their harvest, even snatching it from the thorns, and the thief devours their wealth.
18:5:6/Though suffering doesn't come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,
18:5:7/Yet humans are born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
18:5:8/I would seek God and commit my cause to Him,
18:5:9/Who does great and unfathomable things, wonders without number.
18:5:10/He provides rain for the earth and sends water on the fields,
18:5:11/To lift up those who are low, so that those who mourn may be raised to safety.
18:5:12/He thwarts the plans of the cunning, so their hands achieve no success.
18:5:13/He catches the wise in their own cleverness, and the schemes of the deceitful are rushed to their end.
18:5:14/They encounter darkness in broad daylight, fumbling at noon as if it were night.
18:5:15/But He saves the needy from the sword, from their mouths, and from the hand of the powerful.
18:5:16/So the poor have hope, and wrongdoing is silenced.
18:5:17/See, blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18:5:18/For He wounds, but He also binds up; He injures, but His hands also heal.
18:5:19/He will rescue you from six calamities; in seven, no harm will touch you.
18:5:20/In famine, He will save you from death, and in battle, from the stroke of the sword.
18:5:21/You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
18:5:22/You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
18:5:23/For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
18:5:24/You will know that your tent is secure; you will inspect your property and find nothing amiss.
18:5:25/You will also know that your descendants will be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.
18:5:26/You will come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf of grain harvested at the proper time.
18:5:27/See, this is what we have discovered; it is true. Hear it and apply it for your own good.
18:6:1/But Job answered and said,
18:6:2/If only my grief could be fully measured, and my troubles weighed all at once!
18:6:3/For they would be heavier than the sand of the sea: that's why my words are rushed.
18:6:4/The arrows of the Almighty are inside me, their poison drains my spirit: the terrors of God stand against me.
18:6:5/Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass? Or does the ox bellow over its feed?
18:6:6/Can something tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
18:6:7/The things I once refused to touch are now my mournful food.
18:6:8/If only I could have my request; and that God would grant what I deeply desire!
18:6:9/That it would please God to crush me; to let go of his hand and cut me off!
18:6:10/Then I would still have some comfort; yes, I would rejoice in unrelenting pain, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18:6:11/What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?
18:6:12/Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?
18:6:13/Isn't my help within me? And has wisdom been driven away from me?
18:6:14/One who is suffering deserves kindness from their friend, even if they forsake the fear of the Almighty.
18:6:15/My brothers have been as unreliable as a stream, like the seasonal torrents that vanish,
18:6:16/Which are dark because of the ice, and into which the snow disappears.
18:6:17/When they warm up, they disappear; when it's hot, they vanish from their place.
18:6:18/The paths of their course turn aside; they go nowhere and perish.
18:6:19/The caravans of Tema looked, the travelers of Sheba hoped for them.
18:6:20/They were distressed because they had hoped; they came there and were disappointed.
18:6:21/Now you are nothing; you see my plight and fear.
18:6:22/Did I ever say, 'Bring something to me'? or, 'Pay a ransom for me from your wealth'?
18:6:23/Or, 'Save me from the enemy's hand'? or, 'Rescue me from the grip of the powerful'?
18:6:24/Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand where I have gone wrong.
18:6:25/How powerful are honest words! But what does your arguing prove?
18:6:26/Do you think to reprimand mere words, when the speeches of a despairing person are as wind?
18:6:27/Indeed, you would cast lots for the orphan and barter over your friend.
18:6:28/Now then, be so kind as to look at me. It's obvious if I'm lying.
18:6:29/Please, reconsider; let there be no injustice. Yes, reconsider; my righteousness is at stake.
18:6:30/Is there any wickedness on my tongue? Can't my palate discern the taste of calamity?
18:7:1/Isn't there a set time for humans on earth? Aren't their days just like those of a hired worker?
18:7:2/Just as a servant eagerly looks forward to the shade, and as a hired worker waits for their pay:
18:7:3/So I am burdened with months of emptiness, and nights filled with exhaustion are my lot.
18:7:4/When I lie down, I wonder, When will I get up, and when will the night end? I toss and turn until the break of day.
18:7:5/My body is covered with worms and clumps of dirt; my skin is cracked and repulsive.
18:7:6/My days fly by faster than a weaver's shuttle, and they end without hope.
18:7:7/Oh, remember that my life is just a breath: I will no longer see happiness.
18:7:8/Those who have seen me will see me no more; your eyes are on me, but I am gone.
18:7:9/Just as a cloud dissolves and vanishes, so one who goes down to the grave does not return.
18:7:10/He will never return to his home, and his place will know him no more.
18:7:11/Therefore, I will not hold back my words; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18:7:12/Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?
18:7:13/When I think, My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint;
18:7:14/Then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions:
18:7:15/So that I prefer strangling and death over my life.
18:7:16/I despise it; I don't want to live forever: leave me alone; for my days are meaningless.
18:7:17/What is a human, that you should make so much of them, and that you should care for them so deeply?
18:7:18/And that you should visit them every morning, and test them every moment?
18:7:19/How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone even to swallow my saliva?
18:7:20/I have sinned; what can I do for you, O guardian of humanity? Why have you made me your target, so that I am a burden to myself?
18:7:21/And why do you not forgive my transgression and take away my sin? For now, I will lie down in the dust; and you will seek me in the morning, but I will be no more.
18:8:1/Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
18:8:2/How long will you keep talking like this? And how long will your words be as forceful as a strong wind?
18:8:3/Does God twist justice? Or does the Almighty twist what is right?
18:8:4/If your children have sinned against him, and he has rejected them because of their sin;
18:8:5/If you would earnestly seek God and plead with the Almighty;
18:8:6/If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you and make your righteous dwelling prosper.
18:8:7/Even though your beginning was small, your future would greatly increase.
18:8:8/Please, look into the past, and prepare yourself by studying the experiences of our ancestors:
18:8:9/(For we are only of yesterday and know nothing, because our days on earth are like a shadow:)
18:8:10/Won't they teach you and tell you and express truths from their hearts?
18:8:11/Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
18:8:12/While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than any other plant.
18:8:13/So are the paths of all who forget God; and the hope of the hypocrite will perish:
18:8:14/Whose confidence will be shattered, and whose trust is as fragile as a spider's web.
18:8:15/He will lean on his house, but it won't stand; he will cling to it, but it won't last.
18:8:16/He thrives before the sun, and his shoots spread out over his garden.
18:8:17/His roots entwine around a pile of rocks and look for a place among the stones.
18:8:18/But if he is uprooted from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I never saw you.'
18:8:19/Surely, this is the joy of his way, and from the soil others will spring.
18:8:20/Indeed, God will not reject a blameless person, nor will he support evildoers:
18:8:21/Until he fills your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
18:8:22/Those who hate you will be clothed with shame; and the dwelling of the wicked will vanish.
18:9:1/Then Job answered and said,
18:9:2/I know this is true, but how can a person be right before God?
18:9:3/If someone wanted to argue with Him, they couldn't answer Him once in a thousand times.
18:9:4/He is wise in heart and strong in power: who has ever defied Him and succeeded?
18:9:5/He moves mountains without them knowing it and overturns them in His anger.
18:9:6/He shakes the earth from its place, making its pillars tremble.
18:9:7/He commands the sun not to rise and seals off the stars.
18:9:8/He alone stretches out the heavens and walks on the waves of the sea.
18:9:9/He creates the constellations: the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the southern stars.
18:9:10/He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
18:9:11/Behold, He goes by me, and I do not see Him; He moves past, but I do not perceive Him.
18:9:12/Behold, He snatches away; who can stop Him? Who will say to Him, 'What are You doing?'
18:9:13/If God does not hold back His anger, the proud must bow beneath Him.
18:9:14/How much less can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?
18:9:15/Even if I were innocent, I could not answer; I could only plead with my Judge.
18:9:16/If I called and He answered, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.
18:9:17/For He crushes me with a storm and multiplies my wounds for no reason.
18:9:18/He does not let me catch my breath but fills me with bitterness.
18:9:19/If it's a matter of strength, He is mighty! And if it's a matter of justice, who can challenge Him?
18:9:20/Even if I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.
18:9:21/Even if I were blameless, I would not recognize myself; I would despise my life.
18:9:22/This is why I say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
18:9:23/When disaster brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
18:9:24/The earth is handed over to the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?
18:9:25/Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.
18:9:26/They pass by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its prey.
18:9:27/If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression and smile,'
18:9:28/I still dread all my sufferings, for I know You will not declare me innocent.
18:9:29/If I am guilty, why then do I labor in vain?
18:9:30/If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with soap,
18:9:31/You would still plunge me into filth, and my own clothes would detest me.
18:9:32/For He is not a man like me that I might answer Him, that we might confront each other in court.
18:9:33/There is no mediator between us, who might lay his hand on us both.
18:9:34/Let Him remove His rod from me, and let not His terror frighten me.
18:9:35/Then I would speak without fear of Him, but as it stands, I cannot.
18:10:1/My soul is exhausted with my life; I will express my grievances freely; I will speak from the depth of my distress.
18:10:2/I will ask God, Do not judge me harshly; show me why you are in conflict with me.
18:10:3/Is it beneficial for you to oppress me, to scorn the work of your hands, and favor the plans of the wicked?
18:10:4/Do you have human eyes? Or do you see as humans see?
18:10:5/Are your days like those of a human? Are your years like a man's years,
18:10:6/That you look into my faults, and search for my sin?
18:10:7/You know I am not evil; and no one can rescue from your hand.
18:10:8/Your hands have created and shaped me completely; yet you are destroying me.
18:10:9/Remember, please, that you molded me like clay; will you then return me to dust?
18:10:10/Did you not pour me out like milk, and thicken me like cheese?
18:10:11/You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and tendons.
18:10:12/You have given me life and kindness, and your care has preserved my spirit.
18:10:13/And you have kept these things in your heart; I am aware that this is within you.
18:10:14/If I sin, then you track me, and you will not clear me of my guilt.
18:10:15/If I am evil, woe to me; and if I am righteous, still I will not raise my head. I am overwhelmed with shame; therefore, acknowledge my suffering;
18:10:16/For it grows. You hunt me like a fierce lion: and then you reveal your power over me anew.
18:10:17/You bring new witnesses against me, and increase your anger towards me; changes and conflict are against me.
18:10:18/Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me!
18:10:19/I would have been as though I had never existed; I would have been taken straight from the womb to the grave.
18:10:20/Are not my days few? Then stop, and leave me be, that I might find a little comfort,
18:10:21/Before I go to a place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow;
18:10:22/A land as dark as darkness itself, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.
18:11:1/Then Zophar the Naamathite responded, saying,
18:11:2/Shouldn't a flood of words be answered? And should someone who talks a lot be considered right?
18:11:3/Should your lies make people remain silent? And when you mock, shouldn't someone put you in your place?
18:11:4/For you have claimed, 'My teaching is flawless, and I am without fault in your eyes.'
18:11:5/But if only God would speak and argue against you;
18:11:6/And show you the depths of wisdom, which are twice as much as you know! Understand then that God demands from you less than your sins deserve.
18:11:7/Can you by searching grasp God? Can you comprehend the Almighty completely?
18:11:8/It's as high as the heavens; what can you do? Deeper than the underworld; what can you know?
18:11:9/Its measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
18:11:10/If he decides to cut off, or shut up, or bring together, then who can stop him?
18:11:11/For he knows deceitful men; he sees wickedness too; won't he then take it into account?
18:11:12/For empty-headed men would be wise, even though humans are born as wild as a donkey's colt.
18:11:13/If you prepare your heart and stretch out your hands to him;
18:11:14/If you put away the sin that is in your hand, and allow no evil to dwell in your home,
18:11:15/Then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.
18:11:16/Because you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by.
18:11:17/And your life will be brighter than the noonday; you will emerge from the darkness, shining like the morning.
18:11:18/You will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in safety.
18:11:19/You will lie down with no one to make you afraid, and many will seek your favor.
18:11:20/But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and they will find no way to escape, and their hope will be the exhaling of their last breath.
18:12:1/And Job answered and said,
18:12:2/No doubt you think you're the only smart ones, and wisdom will die with you.
18:12:3/But I have just as much understanding as you; I'm not less than you. Indeed, who doesn't know these things?
18:12:4/I'm like someone mocked by his neighbor, who calls on God, and God answers him: the just and upright man is ridiculed.
18:12:5/The one about to trip is like a lamp scorned by those who are complacent.
18:12:6/The tents of thieves thrive, and those who challenge God feel safe; into their hands God brings plenty.
18:12:7/But ask the animals, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, and they will tell you:
18:12:8/Or talk to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will explain to you.
18:12:9/Who doesn't know from all these that the hand of the LORD has done this?
18:12:10/In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all humankind.
18:12:11/Doesn't the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
18:12:12/Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding comes with long life.
18:12:13/With him are wisdom and power; he has counsel and understanding.
18:12:14/See, he tears down, and it can't be rebuilt; he imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
18:12:15/See, he holds back the waters, and they dry up; also he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.
18:12:16/With him are strength and insight; the misled and the misleader belong to him.
18:12:17/He leads advisors away stripped, and makes fools of judges.
18:12:18/He loosens the bonds imposed by kings, and ties a loincloth around their waists.
18:12:19/He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the powerful.
18:12:20/He silences the trusted advisors, and removes the insight of the elders.
18:12:21/He pours disgrace on nobles, and weakens the strength of the mighty.
18:12:22/He reveals mysteries from the darkness, and brings the deep shadows into the light.
18:12:23/He increases the nations, and destroys them; he expands the nations, and leads them away.
18:12:24/He takes away the understanding of the leaders of the people of the earth, and makes them wander in trackless wastes.
18:12:25/They grope in darkness without light; he makes them stagger like a drunk.
18:13:1/Indeed, my eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.
18:13:2/What you know, I know too: I am not less than you.
18:13:3/I surely want to speak to the Almighty, and I wish to argue my case with God.
18:13:4/But you fabricate lies, you are all worthless healers.
18:13:5/I wish you would all just be quiet! That would be wise.
18:13:6/Listen to my argument, and pay attention to the defense of my lips.
18:13:7/Will you speak unjustly on God's behalf? And speak deceitfully for him?
18:13:8/Will you show him partiality? Will you argue for God?
18:13:9/Is it good that he should scrutinize you? Or as one person mocks another, do you mock him?
18:13:10/He will surely correct you, if you secretly show partiality.
18:13:11/Shouldn't his majesty terrify you? And his dread fall upon you?
18:13:12/Your memories are like ashes, your bodies like clay.
18:13:13/Be quiet, let me alone, so I can speak, and let happen to me what will.
18:13:14/Why do I risk my life and take my life in my hands?
18:13:15/Even if he kills me, I will hope in him: but I will defend my ways to his face.
18:13:16/He will also be my salvation: for a hypocrite cannot come before him.
18:13:17/Listen carefully to my speech, and to my declaration with your ears.
18:13:18/Look now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated.
18:13:19/Who will contend with me? For now, if I am silent, I will perish.
18:13:20/Just do not do two things to me: then I will not hide from you.
18:13:21/Keep your hand far from me: and do not let your terror frighten me.
18:13:22/Then call, and I will answer: or let me speak, and you respond to me.
18:13:23/How many are my wrongdoings and sins? Show me my transgression and my sin.
18:13:24/Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?
18:13:25/Will you harass a leaf blown by the wind? And will you chase the dry chaff?
18:13:26/For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the sins of my youth.
18:13:27/You put my feet in the stocks, and watch all my paths; you set a mark on the soles of my feet.
18:13:28/And he, like something rotten, wastes away, like a garment eaten by moths.
18:14:1/A person born of a woman lives only a short time and is filled with distress.
18:14:2/He emerges like a flower, only to be cut down: he also vanishes like a shadow, never to stay.
18:14:3/And do you focus your attention on such a one, and bring me into trial with you?
18:14:4/Who can produce something pure from something impure? No one.
18:14:5/Given that his days are fixed, the number of his months is known to you, you have set limits he cannot exceed;
18:14:6/Look away from him, that he may rest, until he completes his day like a hired worker.
18:14:7/For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.
18:14:8/Even if its roots grow old in the ground, and its stump dies in the soil;
18:14:9/At the scent of water it will bud and produce branches like a young plant.
18:14:10/But when a person dies, he withers away; when a person expires, where is he?
18:14:11/Just as water evaporates from the sea, and a river dries up and disappears,
18:14:12/So a person lies down and does not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awaken or be roused from their sleep.
18:14:13/I wish you would hide me in the grave, keep me secret until your anger subsides, set a fixed time for me, and then remember me!
18:14:14/If a person dies, will he live again? Throughout all my appointed time, I will wait, until my renewal comes.
18:14:15/You will call, and I will answer you; you will long for the work of your hands.
18:14:16/For now, you count my steps and keep watch over my sin;
18:14:17/My wrongdoing is sealed in a bag, and you cover my sin.
18:14:18/Indeed, mountains fall and crumble, and rocks move from their places.
18:14:19/Water wears down stones; its torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy a person's hope.
18:14:20/You overpower him once and for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.
18:14:21/His children achieve honor, but he does not know it; they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.
18:14:22/Yet his body experiences pain, and his soul within him grieves.
18:15:1/Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, saying,
18:15:2/Should a wise person speak meaningless knowledge and fill themselves with hot air?
18:15:3/Should they engage in pointless discussions or speeches that achieve nothing?
18:15:4/Indeed, you dismiss reverence and limit your prayers before God.
18:15:5/Your mouth reveals your guilt, and you choose the language of the deceitful.
18:15:6/Your own mouth condemns you, not me; indeed, your own lips testify against you.
18:15:7/Are you the first human ever born? Or were you formed before the hills?
18:15:8/Have you listened to God's confidential plans? And do you keep wisdom to yourself?
18:15:9/What do you know that we don't? What insights do you have that we lack?
18:15:10/Among us are the elderly, much older than your father.
18:15:11/Do you consider God's comfort insignificant? Is there a secret you're hiding?
18:15:12/Why are you letting your heart lead you astray? And why do your eyes flash,
18:15:13/That you turn your spirit against God and let such words escape your mouth?
18:15:14/What is a human, that they could be pure? And one born of a woman, that they could be righteous?
18:15:15/See, He places no trust in His holy ones; even the heavens are not pure in His eyes.
18:15:16/How much more detestable and filthy is a person, who drinks wrongdoing like water?
18:15:17/I will explain to you, listen to me; and what I have seen I will tell you;
18:15:18/Which wise people have relayed from their ancestors and have not concealed:
18:15:19/To whom alone the land was given, and no foreigner passed among them.
18:15:20/The wicked person suffers torment all their days, and the number of years is hidden from the tyrant.
18:15:21/A terrifying sound is in their ears; in times of peace, the destroyer will come upon them.
18:15:22/They do not believe they will escape the darkness, and they are destined for the sword.
18:15:23/They wander about for food, asking, 'Where is it?' They know that a day of darkness is at hand.
18:15:24/Distress and anguish terrify them; they overpower him like a king poised for attack.
18:15:25/For they stretch out their hand against God and stand defiant against the Almighty.
18:15:26/They charge at Him, neck extended, behind the thick shields.
18:15:27/Because they cover their face with their fatness and accumulate layers of fat on their sides.
18:15:28/And they live in ruined cities, in houses uninhabited, which are doomed to crumble into ruins.
18:15:29/They will not become wealthy, nor will their assets last, nor will their prosperity spread across the land.
18:15:30/They will not escape the darkness; the flame will wither their branches, and by the breath of His mouth, they will vanish.
18:15:31/Let not the deceived trust in illusions; for illusions will be their downfall.
18:15:32/Their demise will come before its time, and their branches will not flourish.
18:15:33/They will drop their unripe grapes like the vine and shed their blossoms like the olive tree.
18:15:34/For the assembly of the hypocritical will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of corruption.
18:15:35/They conceive trouble and give birth to illusions, and their schemes breed deceit.
18:16:1/Then Job answered and said,
18:16:2/I've heard plenty of this before: all of you are terrible at comforting.
18:16:3/Will these empty words ever end? What makes you so bold to answer like this?
18:16:4/I could talk like you if our roles were reversed, piling words against you and shaking my head.
18:16:5/But I would try to encourage you with my words, and my lips would offer you comfort.
18:16:6/Even when I speak, my grief isn't relieved; and when I stay silent, how does that help me?
18:16:7/But now, I'm just worn out; you've left me with nothing.
18:16:8/You've aged me before my time, which stands as evidence against me; my thinness accuses me to my face.
18:16:9/He tears me apart in his anger, hating me; he grinds his teeth at me; my adversary glares at me with hostility.
18:16:10/They open wide their mouths at me, hitting me in the face in scorn; they unite against me.
18:16:11/God has handed me over to the unjust, throwing me into the hands of the wicked.
18:16:12/I was at peace, but he shattered me; he grabbed me by the neck and smashed me to pieces, setting me up as his target.
18:16:13/His archers surround me, he splits my kidneys open without mercy; he spills my bile on the ground.
18:16:14/He breaks me open again and again, charging at me like a warrior.
18:16:15/I've clothed myself in sackcloth and buried my dignity in the dust.
18:16:16/My face is marred by crying, and the shadow of death is on my eyelids.
18:16:17/It's not because of any wrongdoing on my part; my prayers are sincere.
18:16:18/Earth, do not cover my blood; let my cry for justice find no resting place.
18:16:19/Even now, my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
18:16:20/My friends mock me, but I cry my tears to God.
18:16:21/I wish someone could argue my case before God as one would for a friend.
18:16:22/Soon enough, I'll take the path from which I won't return.
18:17:1/My breath is foul, my days are over, the graves await me.
18:17:2/Aren't there mockers around me? And doesn't my eye endure their scorn?
18:17:3/Come on, guarantee me yourself; who will shake hands with me in agreement?
18:17:4/You have kept them from understanding; therefore, you will not lift them up.
18:17:5/Anyone who flatters his friends, even his children's eyes will grow weak.
18:17:6/I've become a joke among the people; I used to be like a musical instrument.
18:17:7/My eyes are dim from grief, and all my limbs are like shadows.
18:17:8/Honest people will be shocked at this, and the innocent will stand against the deceitful.
18:17:9/The righteous will keep to his path, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.
18:17:10/But as for all of you, come back now; I can't find one wise person among you.
18:17:11/My days are gone, my plans are shattered, along with the desires of my heart.
18:17:12/They turn night into day; the light seems short in the face of darkness.
18:17:13/If I wait, the grave will be my home; I have made my bed in the darkness.
18:17:14/I have called decay my father, and the worm my mother and sister.
18:17:15/So where is my hope now? Who can see any hope for me?
18:17:16/They will descend to the bars of the pit, when we rest together in the dust.
18:18:1/Then Bildad the Shuhite replied, saying,
18:18:2/How long will it take before you stop talking? Pay attention, and then we can speak.
18:18:3/Why are we considered as animals, and seen as disgusting in your eyes?
18:18:4/In his anger, he destroys himself: will the earth be abandoned for you? Will the rock be moved from its place?
18:18:5/Indeed, the light of the wicked will be extinguished, and the spark of his fire will not glow.
18:18:6/The light in his tent will become dark, and his lamp beside him will go out.
18:18:7/The strides of his power will be limited, and his own plans will bring him down.
18:18:8/He will be caught in a net by his own feet, and he will walk into a trap.
18:18:9/The trap will catch him by the heel, and the thief will overpower him.
18:18:10/A trap is set for him on the ground, and a snare lies in his path.
18:18:11/Fears will terrify him on all sides, and chase him at his heels.
18:18:12/His strength will be weakened by hunger, and disaster will be ready at his side.
18:18:13/It will consume the vitality of his skin; even the firstborn of death will devour his strength.
18:18:14/His confidence will be uprooted from his tent, and it will lead him to the king of terrors.
18:18:15/It will reside in his tent, because it belongs to none of his: sulfur will be scattered over his dwelling.
18:18:16/His roots below will dry up, and above his branches will be cut off.
18:18:17/His memory will vanish from the earth, and he will have no name in the streets.
18:18:18/He will be pushed from light into darkness, and banished from the world.
18:18:19/He will have neither son nor nephew among his people, nor any survivor in his dwellings.
18:18:20/Those who come after him will be shocked at his fate, just as those before were terrified.
18:18:21/Surely such are the homes of the wicked, and this is the place of one who does not know God.
18:19:1/Then Job answered and said,
18:19:2/How long will you torment my soul and crush me with your words?
18:19:3/You have insulted me ten times now; you're not ashamed to mistreat me.
18:19:4/Even if I have made a mistake, my error affects only me.
18:19:5/If you really want to accuse me and blame me for my disgrace,
18:19:6/Know that God has wronged me and trapped me with his net.
18:19:7/I cry out about this injustice, but I'm not heard: I shout, but there is no justice.
18:19:8/He has blocked my way so I can't move forward, and has shrouded my paths in darkness.
18:19:9/He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
18:19:10/He has broken me down on all sides, and I'm gone: my hope he has uprooted like a tree.
18:19:11/He has also unleashed his anger against me and considers me one of his enemies.
18:19:12/His forces advance, build their siege against me, and encamp around my dwelling.
18:19:13/He has driven my brothers far from me, and those I knew well have completely estranged me.
18:19:14/My relatives have failed me, and my close friends have forgotten me.
18:19:15/Those living in my house, and my servants, treat me like a stranger: I am a foreigner in their eyes.
18:19:16/I called to my servant, but he did not respond; I begged him with my own mouth.
18:19:17/My own wife finds my breath repulsive, even though I pleaded for the sake of my own children.
18:19:18/Even young children despise me; when I stand up, they talk against me.
18:19:19/All my intimate friends detest me; those I loved have turned against me.
18:19:20/My bones stick to my skin and flesh, and I have barely escaped with the skin of my teeth.
18:19:21/Show compassion for me, my friends, for God's hand has struck me.
18:19:22/Why do you persecute me as God does, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
18:19:23/I wish my words were written down, that they were inscribed in a book,
18:19:24/That they were etched with an iron stylus and lead, forever in the rock.
18:19:25/For I know that my redeemer lives, and he will stand upon the earth at the end.
18:19:26/And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh, I will see God,
18:19:27/Whom I will see for myself, and my eyes will behold, and not as a stranger. My heart yearns within me.
18:19:28/But you should ask yourselves, 'Why are we persecuting him?' realizing that the root of the issue lies within me.
18:19:29/Fear the sword; for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, so you may know there is a judgment.
18:20:1/Then Zophar the Naamathite responded, saying,
18:20:2/That's why my thoughts compel me to answer, and I'm in a hurry to do so.
18:20:3/I've heard the criticism against me, and my insight prompts me to respond.
18:20:4/Don't you know this from long ago, ever since humans were placed on earth,
18:20:5/That the success of the wicked is brief, and the happiness of the hypocrite lasts only a moment?
18:20:6/Even if his greatness soars to the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,
18:20:7/He will vanish forever like his own waste; those who have seen him will ask, 'Where is he?'
18:20:8/He will disappear like a dream and not be found; he will be swept away like a vision of the night.
18:20:9/The eye that saw him will see him no more; his place will no longer observe him.
18:20:10/His children will try to win favor with the poor, and his hands will give back their wealth.
18:20:11/His bones are filled with the sins of his youth, which will lie with him in the dust.
18:20:12/Even if evil tastes sweet in his mouth, even if he hides it under his tongue,
18:20:13/Even if he savors it and won't let it go, but keeps it in his mouth,
18:20:14/Yet his food in his stomach turns sour, it becomes the venom of vipers within him.
18:20:15/He has swallowed wealth, but he will vomit it up; God will force it out of his stomach.
18:20:16/He will suck the poison of vipers; the fangs of a snake will kill him.
18:20:17/He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18:20:18/What he worked for he must give back, and he cannot enjoy it; he will return his wealth without delighting in it.
18:20:19/Because he has oppressed and neglected the poor; because he has seized a house he did not build,
18:20:20/Surely he will not feel peace in his stomach; he cannot save what he desired.
18:20:21/Nothing is left of his food; therefore, no one will crave his wealth.
18:20:22/When he is at his peak, he will be in trouble; every hand of the wicked will come against him.
18:20:23/When he is about to fill his stomach, God will unleash His fury on him and rain it down on him while he is eating.
18:20:24/He will try to escape from an iron weapon, but a bronze arrow will pierce him.
18:20:25/It is pulled out and comes from his body; indeed, the shining blade comes out of his liver; terror will be upon him.
18:20:26/Total darkness is reserved for his treasures; an unfanned fire will consume him; it will go badly for anyone left in his tent.
18:20:27/The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.
18:20:28/The wealth of his house will disappear, and his possessions will flow away on the day of God's anger.
18:20:29/This is the fate of the wicked from God, the heritage decreed for him by God.
18:21:1/But Job answered and said,
18:21:2/Listen carefully to my words, and let this be your comfort.
18:21:3/Allow me to speak; and after I have spoken, go ahead and mock.
18:21:4/As for me, is my complaint to a human? And if it is, why shouldn't I be upset?
18:21:5/Pay attention to me, be amazed, and put your hand over your mouth.
18:21:6/Whenever I remember, I am filled with fear, and shivering grips my body.
18:21:7/Why do the wicked live on, grow old, and even gain power?
18:21:8/Their descendants are established in their presence, and their offspring are in their sight.
18:21:9/Their homes are free from fear, and they are not punished by God's wrath.
18:21:10/Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and does not miscarry.
18:21:11/They send out their children like a flock, and their kids jump around.
18:21:12/They play the tambourine and harp, and celebrate to the sound of the flute.
18:21:13/They spend their days in prosperity, and suddenly they go down to the grave.
18:21:14/So they say to God, 'Leave us alone; we have no desire to know Your ways.'
18:21:15/'What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what benefit do we get if we pray to Him?'
18:21:16/See, their prosperity is not in their own hands; I want no part of the plans of the wicked.
18:21:17/How often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does disaster come upon them, the distribution of sorrows in His anger?
18:21:18/They are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that a storm sweeps away.
18:21:19/God stores up their iniquity for their children: He repays them, and they will know it.
18:21:20/Their own eyes will see their destruction, and they will drink from the wrath of the Almighty.
18:21:21/For what do they care about their household after them, when their months are cut off halfway?
18:21:22/Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges even the highest?
18:21:23/One dies in full vigor, completely secure and at peace.
18:21:24/Their bodies are well fed, and their bones are rich with marrow.
18:21:25/And another dies with a bitter soul, never having enjoyed prosperity.
18:21:26/They both lie down in the dust, and worms cover them.
18:21:27/See, I know your thoughts and the schemes you wrongfully plot against me.
18:21:28/For you say, 'Where is the house of the noble? And where are the tents where the wicked lived?'
18:21:29/Haven't you asked those who travel the roads? And don't you accept their word
18:21:30/That the wicked are spared for the day of disaster? They are led away on the day of wrath.
18:21:31/Who will confront him with his actions? And who will repay him for what he has done?
18:21:32/Yet he will be carried to the grave, and watch will be kept over his tomb.
18:21:33/The soil of the valley will be sweet to him; all humanity will follow after him, and countless others have gone before him.
18:21:34/How then do you offer me empty comfort, when in your answers only falsehood remains?
18:22:1/Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
18:22:2/Can a person really benefit God, as someone wise benefits themselves?
18:22:3/Does it bring joy to the Almighty if you're righteous? Or does it benefit him if you make your ways perfect?
18:22:4/Will he correct you out of fear of you? Will he enter into judgment with you?
18:22:5/Isn't your wickedness significant? And aren't your sins endless?
18:22:6/You've taken a pledge from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
18:22:7/You haven't given water to the thirsty, and you've withheld bread from the hungry.
18:22:8/But the powerful person owned the land; and the respected person lived in it.
18:22:9/You've sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the orphans has been crushed.
18:22:10/That's why traps surround you, and sudden fear terrifies you;
18:22:11/Or darkness, so you cannot see; and floods of water cover you.
18:22:12/Isn't God in the heights of heaven? And see how high the stars are!
18:22:13/And you say, 'How does God know? Can he judge through the thick clouds?'
18:22:14/Thick clouds cover him, so he doesn't see; and he walks on the vault of heaven.
18:22:15/Have you noticed the path that wicked men have walked?
18:22:16/Who were cut down before their time, whose foundations were swept away by a flood?
18:22:17/Who said to God, 'Leave us alone': and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'
18:22:18/Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the plans of the wicked are far from me.
18:22:19/The righteous see it and are happy: and the innocent mock them.
18:22:20/While our possessions are not diminished, but the remainder of them the fire consumes.
18:22:21/Get to know him now, and be at peace: thereby good will come to you.
18:22:22/Accept, please, the law from his mouth, and keep his words in your heart.
18:22:23/If you return to the Almighty, you'll be restored, you'll remove iniquity far from your dwellings.
18:22:24/Then you'll treat gold like dust, and the gold of Ophir like the stones of the brooks.
18:22:25/Yes, the Almighty will be your defense, and you'll have plenty of silver.
18:22:26/For then you'll delight in the Almighty, and lift your face to God.
18:22:27/You'll pray to him, and he'll hear you, and you'll fulfill your vows.
18:22:28/You'll also decree a thing, and it will be established for you: and light will shine on your ways.
18:22:29/When people are brought low, then you'll say, 'There's a lifting up'; and he'll save the humble person.
18:22:30/He'll deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the purity of your hands.
18:23:1/Then Job answered and said,
18:23:2/Even today, my complaint is bitter: my suffering is heavier than my sighs.
18:23:3/If only I knew where to find him! If only I could go to his dwelling!
18:23:4/I would present my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
18:23:5/I would find out what he would answer me, and understand what he would tell me.
18:23:6/Would he oppose me with his great power? No, he would give me strength.
18:23:7/There, the righteous could argue with him; and I would be forever freed from my judge.
18:23:8/Look, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him;
18:23:9/To the left, where he is working, but I cannot see him; he hides on the right, so I cannot see him.
18:23:10/Yet he knows the path I take; when he has tested me, I will come out like gold.
18:23:11/My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.
18:23:12/I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
18:23:13/But he is unchangeable, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he desires.
18:23:14/For he carries out what is decreed for me, and many such plans are with him.
18:23:15/That is why I am terrified in his presence; when I think of this, I fear him.
18:23:16/For God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
18:23:17/Because I was not silenced by the darkness, nor by the deep shadow that covers my face.
18:24:1/Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do those who know him not see his days?
18:24:2/Some move boundary stones; they forcefully steal flocks and feed on them.
18:24:3/They drive away the donkey of the orphan, they take the widow’s ox as collateral.
18:24:4/They push the needy aside: the poor of the earth hide together.
18:24:5/Look, like wild donkeys in the desert, they go out to their work; getting up early for a prey: the wilderness provides food for them and for their children.
18:24:6/They harvest their grain in the field: and they collect the crops of the wicked.
18:24:7/They make the naked sleep without clothes, leaving them without cover in the cold.
18:24:8/They are soaked by mountain showers, and hug rocks for lack of shelter.
18:24:9/They snatch the fatherless from the breast, and take collateral from the poor.
18:24:10/They make them go naked without clothes, and take away the bundle from the hungry;
18:24:11/Who make oil within their walls, and press their wine, yet suffer thirst.
18:24:12/People moan from within the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out: yet God does not charge them with folly.
18:24:13/They are among those who rebel against the light; they do not know its ways nor stay in its paths.
18:24:14/The murderer rises with the light, kills the poor and needy, and at night is like a thief.
18:24:15/The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk, saying, 'No eye will see me.' and disguises his face.
18:24:16/In the dark, they break into houses, which they marked for themselves in the daytime: they do not know the light.
18:24:17/For them, the morning is as dark as death; if someone recognizes them, they fear the terrors of the darkness of death.
18:24:18/He moves swiftly as the waters; their portion on earth is cursed: they do not turn towards the vineyards.
18:24:19/Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so does the grave those who have sinned.
18:24:20/The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feast on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken like a tree.
18:24:21/He mistreats the barren who does not bear: and does not help the widow.
18:24:22/He also pulls down the mighty with his power: he rises up, and no one is sure of life.
18:24:23/Though he is given safety, on which he relies; yet his eyes are on their ways.
18:24:24/They are lifted up for a little while, but then are gone and brought low; they are removed as all others, and cut off like the tops of the ears of corn.
18:24:25/And if it is not so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech worthless?
18:25:1/Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
18:25:2/Power and awe belong to him; he establishes peace in his heavenly realms.
18:25:3/Can his armies be counted? And who doesn't bask in his light? 
18:25:4/So how can a person be right with God? Or how can someone born of a woman be pure? 
18:25:5/Look even at the moon, it doesn't shine bright; even the stars aren't clean in his eyes.
18:25:6/How much less significant is a person, who is but a worm? And the children of humanity, who are also but worms?
18:26:1/But Job replied, saying,
18:26:2/"How have you helped the powerless? How have you saved the arm that lacks strength?
18:26:3/How have you advised someone without wisdom? And how have you clearly explained the facts?
18:26:4/To whom have you spoken these words? And whose spirit was inspired by you?
18:26:5/Dead things are formed from beneath the waters, along with their inhabitants.
18:26:6/The realm of the dead is fully exposed to him, and destruction is unhidden.
18:26:7/He stretches out the north over empty space and suspends the earth on nothing.
18:26:8/He wraps up the waters in his thick clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
18:26:9/He conceals the view of his throne, covering it with his cloud.
18:26:10/He has set a boundary for the waters, marking the limit between day and night.
18:26:11/The foundations of heaven tremble and are amazed at his rebuke.
18:26:12/With his power, he parts the sea, and with his wisdom, he strikes down the haughty.
18:26:13/By his spirit, he has adorned the heavens; his hand has shaped the fleeing serpent.
18:26:14/Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways; and how faint is the whisper we hear of him? But the thunder of his power, who can comprehend?
18:27:1/Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
18:27:2/As God lives, who has taken away my right to justice; and the Almighty, who has troubled my soul;
18:27:3/As long as I breathe, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 
18:27:4/My lips will not speak evil, nor will my tongue utter lies.
18:27:5/I refuse to justify you: until I die, I will not compromise my integrity.
18:27:6/I will firmly hold onto my righteousness and will not let it go: my heart will not reproach me as long as I live.
18:27:7/May my enemy be like the wicked, and those who rise up against me like the unrighteous.
18:27:8/For what hope does the hypocrite have, even if he gains, when God takes away his life? 
18:27:9/Will God listen to his cry when trouble comes upon him? 
18:27:10/Will he find joy in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God? 
18:27:11/I will teach you about the ways of God: I will not hide what is with the Almighty.
18:27:12/See, all of you have witnessed it; why then do you act so foolishly? 
18:27:13/This is what a wicked person will receive from God, and the inheritance of oppressors from the Almighty.
18:27:14/If his children multiply, they are destined for the sword: and his descendants will not have enough to eat.
18:27:15/Those who survive him will be buried in death: and his widows will not mourn.
18:27:16/Even if he accumulates silver like dust, and piles up clothing like clay; 
18:27:17/He may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will share the silver.
18:27:18/He builds his house as fragile as a moth's cocoon, and like a shack that a watchman makes.
18:27:19/The wealthy man will lie down, but he will not be gathered up: he opens his eyes, and he is gone.
18:27:20/Terrors seize him like water, a storm snatches him away in the night.
18:27:21/The east wind carries him off, and he goes: and it hurls him out of his place with a storm.
18:27:22/For God will hurl his wrath upon him, and not spare: he desperately tries to escape from His power.
18:27:23/People will clap their hands at him, and will jeer him out of his place.
18:28:1/There's definitely a source for silver, and a place where gold is refined.
18:28:2/Iron is extracted from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
18:28:3/He puts an end to darkness, and thoroughly explores every detail: the dark rocks, and the deepest shadows.
18:28:4/Water bursts forth from its source; even the streams that were forgotten by foot: they dry up, they vanish from human sight.
18:28:5/From the earth comes food, and beneath it, it's as if fire has transformed it.
18:28:6/Its rocks are the source of sapphires, and it contains particles of gold.
18:28:7/There's a path no bird knows, unseen by the vulture's eye:
18:28:8/Young lions have not walked it, nor has the mighty lion crossed it.
18:28:9/He reaches out his hand to the rock; he overturns mountains from their roots.
18:28:10/He carves out channels among the rocks; his eyes spot every valuable thing.
18:28:11/He controls the rivers to prevent them from overflowing; and brings hidden things to light.
18:28:12/But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
18:28:13/Humans do not know its value; it cannot be found in the land of the living.
18:28:14/The depths say, 'It's not in me'; and the sea says, 'It's not with me.'
18:28:15/It can't be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
18:28:16/It can't be measured with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx, or sapphires.
18:28:17/Gold and crystal cannot compare to it; nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold.
18:28:18/Coral and pearls are not even worth mentioning; the value of wisdom is far beyond rubies.
18:28:19/The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare to it; it cannot be valued with the purest gold.
18:28:20/So where does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?
18:28:21/It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the birds of the air.
18:28:22/Even Destruction and Death say, 'We've only heard rumors of it with our ears.'
18:28:23/God understands its way, and he knows its place.
18:28:24/For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens;
18:28:25/To establish the force of the wind; and he measures the waters with precision.
18:28:26/When he set a law for the rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
18:28:27/Then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and also searched it out.
18:28:28/And to humanity he said, 'Look, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding.'
18:29:1/Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
18:29:2/I wish I could go back to the months past, to the days when God looked after me; 
18:29:3/When his light shone over my head, and by his light, I walked through darkness; 
18:29:4/Back to the days of my youth, when God's mystery was over my home; 
18:29:5/When the Almighty was still with me, and my children were around me; 
18:29:6/When my paths were smooth as if washed with cream, and the rocks flowed with oil for me; 
18:29:7/When I walked out to the city gate, when I took my place in the public square!
18:29:8/Young men saw me and hid, while the elderly stood up in respect.
18:29:9/Leaders stopped speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.
18:29:10/The nobles were silent, their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
18:29:11/When people heard me, they praised me; and when they saw me, they approved. 
18:29:12/Because I helped the poor who cried out, the orphans, and those with no one to assist them.
18:29:13/The blessing of those about to perish came upon me; and I made the widow's heart sing with joy.
18:29:14/I wore righteousness like clothing; my fairness was like a robe and a crown.
18:29:15/I was eyes to the blind, and I was legs to the lame.
18:29:16/I was like a father to the needy: and I investigated cases I did not know.
18:29:17/And I broke the jaws of the wicked, taking the victims from their teeth.
18:29:18/Then I thought, 'I will die in my own home, and my days will be as numerous as the sand.'
18:29:19/My roots spread out to the waters, and the dew rested on my branches all night.
18:29:20/My honor was always fresh with me, and my strength was renewed in my grasp.
18:29:21/People listened to me and waited, staying silent for my advice.
18:29:22/After I spoke, they had nothing to add; my words fell gently on them.
18:29:23/They waited for my words like rain; they opened their mouths wide for the spring rain.
18:29:24/If I smiled at them, they could hardly believe it; they valued the favor of my face.
18:29:25/I chose their path and led, sitting as a chief, living like a king among his troops, comforting those who mourned.
18:30:1/But now, those younger than me mock me, whose fathers I wouldn't have considered worthy to sit with my sheepdogs.
18:30:2/Indeed, what use would I have for the strength of their hands, in those whose vigor has faded away?
18:30:3/Due to lack and hunger, they were isolated; fleeing into the wilderness, into places long deserted and barren.
18:30:4/They gathered mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their food.
18:30:5/They were expelled from society, (people shouted at them as they would at a thief;)
18:30:6/Forced to live in the cliffs of valleys, in caves of the earth, and among the rocks.
18:30:7/They cried out among the bushes; they huddled under the nettles.
18:30:8/They were offspring of fools, yes, children of worthless men: they were more despised than the earth itself.
18:30:9/And now I am the subject of their songs, yes, I am their mocking phrase.
18:30:10/They detest me, they keep their distance from me, and do not hesitate to spit in my direction.
18:30:11/Because he has loosened my bonds, and afflicted me, they have also thrown off restraint in my presence.
18:30:12/The young ones rise up against me on my right; they push aside my feet, and they pave their path of destruction against me.
18:30:13/They ruin my path, they contribute to my disaster, without anyone to help me.
18:30:14/They come at me like a flood breaking through: in my desolation, they roll themselves upon me.
18:30:15/Terrors turn against me: they chase my soul like the wind: and my well-being disappears like a cloud.
18:30:16/And now my soul is poured out within me; days of suffering grip me.
18:30:17/My bones are pierced within me at night, and my muscles get no rest.
18:30:18/The sheer force of my illness changes my clothing: it binds me tight like the collar of my coat.
18:30:19/He has thrown me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.
18:30:20/I cry out to you, but you do not answer me: I stand up, but you pay me no attention.
18:30:21/You have become harsh to me: with your strong hand you oppose me.
18:30:22/You lift me up to the wind; you make me ride on it, and you dissolve my being.
18:30:23/For I know that you will bring me to death, to the dwelling place appointed for all the living.
18:30:24/Yet, he will not reach out his hand to the grave, even though they cry out in his downfall.
18:30:25/Did I not weep for those in trouble? Was not my soul pained for the needy?
18:30:26/When I hoped for good, evil came to me; and when I waited for light, darkness arrived.
18:30:27/My insides churned and found no rest; days of affliction confronted me.
18:30:28/I walked in mourning without sunlight; I stood up and cried out in the assembly.
18:30:29/I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
18:30:30/My skin turns black on me, and my bones burn with fever.
18:30:31/My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of those who weep.
18:31:1/I made a promise to myself to stay pure; why then should I lust after a young woman?
18:31:2/For what connection to God could come from above? And what inheritance from the Almighty from the heavens?
18:31:3/Isn't destruction meant for the wicked? And a strange punishment for those who do wrong?
18:31:4/Doesn't he observe my ways, and count every step I take?
18:31:5/If I have lived a lie, or if I've rushed into deceit;
18:31:6/Let me be judged fairly so that God may see my honesty.
18:31:7/If I have strayed from the right path, and my heart has followed what my eyes see, and if I have stained my hands;
18:31:8/Then let me plant crops, but let someone else eat them; yes, let my descendants be uprooted.
18:31:9/If my heart has been led astray by a woman, or if I've lurked at my neighbor's door;
18:31:10/Then let my wife belong to another, and let others take advantage of her.
18:31:11/For this is a terrible sin; yes, it is a wrongdoing to be judged by the courts.
18:31:12/For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would eliminate all my gains.
18:31:13/If I have ignored the rights of my male or female servants when they had a grievance against me;
18:31:14/What will I do when God stands up? And when he holds me accountable, what will I say?
18:31:15/Didn't the same one who made me in the womb make them? And weren't we formed in the womb by the same hand?
18:31:16/If I have denied the needy their desires, or have caused the widow's eyes to shed tears;
18:31:17/Or have eaten my food alone, without sharing it with the orphan;
18:31:18/(For from my youth he was raised with me as a father, and I have been her guide since my mother's womb;)
18:31:19/If I have seen anyone dying for lack of clothing, or the needy without a cloak;
18:31:20/If they have not praised me for warming them with the wool of my sheep;
18:31:21/If I have raised my hand against the orphan, when I saw I had support in the community;
18:31:22/Then let my arm be torn from my shoulder, and be broken off at the joint.
18:31:23/For the thought of destruction from God was terrifying to me, and because of his majesty I could not stand.
18:31:24/If I have put my trust in gold, or said to pure gold, 'You are my security';
18:31:25/If I have rejoiced because my wealth was vast, and because I had amassed a great fortune;
18:31:26/If I have gazed at the sun shining, or the moon moving in splendor;
18:31:27/And my heart was secretly enticed, or my hand threw kisses in homage;
18:31:28/This too would be a sin deserving judgment, for I would have denied the God above.
18:31:29/If I have gloated over my enemy's misfortune, or exulted when harm befell him;
18:31:30/I have not allowed my mouth to sin by cursing his life.
18:31:31/If the people in my household have never said, 'If only we had meat to eat! We are never satisfied.'
18:31:32/I did not let strangers sleep in the streets; I opened my doors to the traveler.
18:31:33/If I have concealed my sins as people do, by hiding my guilt in my heart;
18:31:34/Because I feared the crowd, or was afraid of family scorn, so that I kept quiet and did not go outside;
18:31:35/Oh, how I wish someone would listen to me! Look, my defense is that the Almighty would answer me, and that my accuser had written down charges.
18:31:36/I would surely carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.
18:31:37/I would tell him the number of my steps; I would approach him like a prince.
18:31:38/If my land accuses me, or all its furrows cry out together;
18:31:39/If I have eaten its yield without payment, or caused its owners to lose their lives;
18:31:40/Let thorns grow instead of wheat, and weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
18:32:1/So these three men stopped responding to Job, because he believed he was right.
18:32:2/Then Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, from the family of Ram, became angry. He was upset with Job for justifying himself instead of God.
18:32:3/He was also angry with Job's three friends because they couldn't find an answer and yet had condemned Job.
18:32:4/Elihu had waited to speak until Job was done because the others were older than he.
18:32:5/When Elihu saw that there was no response from these three men, he became angry.
18:32:6/And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite said, "I am young, and you are much older; that's why I was hesitant and afraid to share my opinion with you.
18:32:7/"I thought, 'Let age speak; let the years teach wisdom.'
18:32:8/But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.
18:32:9/It's not only the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right.
18:32:10/Therefore, I say, listen to me; I too will share my insights.
18:32:11/Look, I waited for your arguments; I listened to your reasoning while you searched for the right words.
18:32:12/Yes, I paid attention to you, and none of you proved Job wrong; none of you had an answer to his statements.
18:32:13/So you shouldn't claim, 'We have found wisdom; God will defeat him, not a human.'
18:32:14/Job hasn't directed his words at me, and I won't respond to him with your arguments.
18:32:15/They were stunned; they had no more responses; they stopped talking.
18:32:16/When I had waited (for they didn't speak, but stood still and didn't respond anymore),
18:32:17/I thought, 'I will also give my answer; I too will share my opinion.'
18:32:18/For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me.
18:32:19/Look, my belly is like wine that has no vent; it's ready to burst like new wineskins.
18:32:20/I will speak so I can find relief; I will open my lips and reply.
18:32:21/Please, don't let me show favoritism to anyone or flatter any person.
18:32:22/For I don't know how to flatter; if I did, my Maker would soon take me away.
18:33:1/So, Job, please listen to what I have to say and pay attention to all my words.
18:33:2/Look, I've started speaking; my tongue is moving in my mouth.
18:33:3/My words come from a sincere heart, and my lips will speak knowledge clearly.
18:33:4/God's spirit created me, and the Almighty's breath gives me life.
18:33:5/If you can respond, get your arguments ready and stand up.
18:33:6/Look, I'm here as you wanted, in God's place: I too was made from clay.
18:33:7/Don't be scared by me; I won't come down hard on you.
18:33:8/You've definitely said these things in my hearing, and I've heard you claim,
18:33:9/"I am pure, without sin; I am innocent and have no guilt in me."
18:33:10/"Look, God finds faults in me; He treats me like an enemy,"
18:33:11/"He puts my feet in shackles and watches every move I make."
18:33:12/But you're wrong in this; let me tell you, God is greater than any human.
18:33:13/Why argue with Him? He doesn't have to explain His actions to anyone.
18:33:14/God speaks in one way, or in another, yet people don't notice.
18:33:15/In dreams, in visions at night, when deep sleep falls on people as they lie in bed,
18:33:16/He opens people's ears and seals their instruction,
18:33:17/To turn them from wrongdoing and keep pride away from them.
18:33:18/He keeps their souls from the pit, their lives from ending by the sword.
18:33:19/They're disciplined with pain on their beds, with constant distress in their bones,
18:33:20/So that they loathe bread and no longer crave their favorite foods.
18:33:21/Their bodies waste away unseen; their bones, once hidden, now stick out.
18:33:22/Their souls draw near to the grave, their lives to those who bring death.
18:33:23/If there's a messenger for them, a mediator, one out of a thousand, to show them how to be upright,
18:33:24/Then God is merciful to them and says, 'Save them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.'
18:33:25/Their bodies become healthier than when they were young; they return to the days of their youth.
18:33:26/They pray to God, who is pleased with them, they see His face with joy, for He restores to them their righteousness.
18:33:27/He looks at humans and if anyone says, 'I have sinned, I have twisted what is right, and it was not worth it,'
18:33:28/God will rescue their soul from going to the pit, and their life will see the light.
18:33:29/See, God does all these things for people, time and again,
18:33:30/To bring them back from the pit, so they may enjoy the light of life.
18:33:31/Pay attention, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
18:33:32/If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want to prove you right.
18:33:33/If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.
18:34:1/Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
18:34:2/Listen to my words, you wise people; and pay attention, you who have knowledge.
18:34:3/Just as the ear tests words, the mouth tastes food.
18:34:4/Let's decide what's right; let's figure out together what is good.
18:34:5/For Job has claimed, 'I am in the right, yet God has denied me justice.'
18:34:6/Should I lie against my own right? My wound is incurable, though I am without sin.
18:34:7/Who is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?
18:34:8/Who keeps company with those who do wrong, and walks with wicked people.
18:34:9/For he has said, 'It profits a person nothing to take delight in God.'
18:34:10/So listen to me, you people of understanding: it is unthinkable that God would do wrong, and that the Almighty would act unjustly.
18:34:11/For he repays a person for their work, and ensures that everyone gets what their actions deserve.
18:34:12/Indeed, God will not act wickedly, and the Almighty will not twist justice.
18:34:13/Who has put him in charge of the earth? Or who has laid out the whole world?
18:34:14/If he focused his heart on humanity, if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,
18:34:15/All flesh would perish together, and humans would return to dust.
18:34:16/If you have understanding, listen to this; pay attention to what I say.
18:34:17/Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the one who is most just?
18:34:18/Is it right to tell a king, 'You are wicked,' and to rulers, 'You are wrong'?
18:34:19/How much less to him who does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands.
18:34:20/In an instant they will die, and people will be troubled at midnight and pass away; the powerful will be removed without human intervention.
18:34:21/For his eyes are on the ways of humans, and he sees all their steps.
18:34:22/There is no darkness, nor deep shadow, where evildoers can hide themselves.
18:34:23/For he does not need to consider a person further, that they should go before God in judgment.
18:34:24/He shatters the powerful without investigation and sets others in their place.
18:34:25/Therefore he recognizes their deeds, and overturns them in the night, so they are destroyed.
18:34:26/He strikes them down as wicked in the sight of others,
18:34:27/Because they turned away from following him and had no regard for any of his ways,
18:34:28/So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted.
18:34:29/When he gives peace, who can cause trouble? And when he hides his face, who can see him? Whether it is against a nation or a single individual,
18:34:30/That the godless should not rule, lest the people be ensnared.
18:34:31/Surely it is right to say to God, 'I have been punished; I will not offend anymore;
18:34:32/Teach me what I do not see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'
18:34:33/Should it be according to your terms? He will repay it, whether you refuse or choose; and not I. So tell us what you know.
18:34:34/Let people of understanding speak to me, and let a wise person listen to me.
18:34:35/Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words lack insight.
18:34:36/My wish is that Job may be tested to the utmost for responding like wicked people.
18:34:37/For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.
18:35:1/Elihu continued speaking, saying,
18:35:2/Do you really think it's right to claim, "I am more righteous than God"?
18:35:3/You've asked, "What's in it for me?" and, "What do I gain by not sinning?"
18:35:4/I will respond to you and your friends as well.
18:35:5/Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.
18:35:6/If you sin, how does it affect Him? Or if you keep sinning, what does it do to Him?
18:35:7/If you're righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from you?
18:35:8/Your wrongdoing may harm another person like yourself; and your righteousness may benefit another human.
18:35:9/Because of widespread oppression, the oppressed cry out; they scream for relief from the power of the mighty.
18:35:10/Yet no one asks, "Where is God my Creator, who inspires songs in the night,
18:35:11/Who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?"
18:35:12/There they cry out, but no one answers, due to the arrogance of wicked people.
18:35:13/Indeed, God does not listen to empty pleas, nor does the Almighty pay attention to them.
18:35:14/Even though you claim you can't see Him, judgment is before Him; so you should trust in Him.
18:35:15/But now, because things are not as you say, He has acted out of anger; yet you do not recognize the severity of it.
18:35:16/Therefore, Job speaks without purpose; he multiplies words without understanding.
18:36:1/Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
18:36:2/Allow me a moment, and I will show you that I still have things to say about God.
18:36:3/I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will attribute righteousness to my Creator.
18:36:4/Indeed, my words will be truthful: someone with perfect knowledge is with you.
18:36:5/Look, God is powerful, and does not despise anyone: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
18:36:6/He does not preserve the life of the wicked: but gives justice to the poor.
18:36:7/He does not take his eyes off the righteous: but with kings, they are on the throne; yes, he establishes them forever, and they are lifted high.
18:36:8/And if they are bound in chains, and caught in the ropes of suffering; 
18:36:9/Then he shows them their actions, and their sins that they have gone beyond.
18:36:10/He also opens their ear to correction, and commands that they turn away from sin.
18:36:11/If they listen and serve him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in joy.
18:36:12/But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword, and they will die without understanding.
18:36:13/But the hypocrites in heart accumulate anger: they do not cry out when he binds them.
18:36:14/They die young, and their life ends among the impure.
18:36:15/He rescues the poor in their suffering, and opens their ears in oppression.
18:36:16/In the same way, he would have led you out of a tight spot into a spacious place, where there is no confinement; and what is set on your table would be rich in abundance.
18:36:17/But you have followed the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice catch up with you.
18:36:18/Because there is anger, be careful lest he sweep you away with a blow: then no great ransom can free you.
18:36:19/Will he value your wealth? No, not gold, nor all the forces of power.
18:36:20/Do not long for the night, when people are cut off in their place.
18:36:21/Be careful, do not look favorably on sin: for you have chosen this rather than suffering.
18:36:22/Look, God is lifted high by his power: who teaches like him? 
18:36:23/Who has directed his path? or who can say, You have done wrong? 
18:36:24/Remember to praise his work, which people observe.
18:36:25/Everyone can see it; people can view it from afar.
18:36:26/Look, God is immense, and we do not fully understand him, nor can the number of his years be discovered.
18:36:27/For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to its vapor: 
18:36:28/Which the clouds drop and distill upon people abundantly.
18:36:29/Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, or the thunder from his dwelling? 
18:36:30/Look, he spreads his light over it, and covers the depths of the sea.
18:36:31/For by these, he judges the people; he provides food in abundance.
18:36:32/With clouds, he covers the light; and commands it not to shine through the cloud that comes between.
18:36:33/The thunder announces his presence, the livestock also sense the approaching storm.
18:37:1/This also makes my heart tremble and moves it from its place.
18:37:2/Listen closely to the sound of his voice, and the noise that comes from his mouth.
18:37:3/He directs it across the entire sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
18:37:4/After it, a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his majesty; and he does not hold them back when his voice is heard.
18:37:5/God thunders wonderfully with his voice; he does great things that we cannot understand.
18:37:6/For he commands the snow, 'Fall on the earth'; likewise to the light rain, and to the heavy rain of his strength.
18:37:7/He seals up the hand of every person; so that all people may know his work.
18:37:8/Then the animals go into hiding and stay in their lairs.
18:37:9/From the south comes the storm, and cold from the north.
18:37:10/By the breath of God, frost is created, and the expanse of the waters is restricted.
18:37:11/Also, by watering, he tires the thick cloud; he scatters his bright cloud.
18:37:12/And it is turned around by his guidance: so that they may do whatever he commands them on the face of the inhabited earth.
18:37:13/He causes it to happen, whether for discipline, or for his land, or for kindness.
18:37:14/Pay attention to this, O Job: stop and consider the marvelous works of God.
18:37:15/Do you know when God dispatches them, and causes the light of his cloud to shine?
18:37:16/Do you know the balance of the clouds, the marvelous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
18:37:17/How your clothes become warm when he calms the earth with the south wind?
18:37:18/Have you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong, and like a cast mirror?
18:37:19/Teach us what we should say to him; we cannot arrange our words because of darkness.
18:37:20/Should it be reported to him that I wish to speak? If someone speaks, surely they will be swallowed up.
18:37:21/And now, people do not see the bright light in the clouds, but the wind passes and clears them.
18:37:22/Clear weather comes from the north: with God is awesome majesty.
18:37:23/Concerning the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, in judgment, and abundant in righteousness; he does not oppress.
18:37:24/Therefore, people revere him: he does not regard those who think themselves wise.
18:38:1/Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind, saying,
18:38:2/Who is this that obscures my plans with words lacking insight?
18:38:3/Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
18:38:4/Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you have understanding.
18:38:5/Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the measuring line across it?
18:38:6/On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone,
18:38:7/While the morning stars sang together, and all the angels shouted for joy?
18:38:8/Who contained the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
18:38:9/When I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,
18:38:10/When I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,
18:38:11/And said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?
18:38:12/Have you ever commanded the morning to appear and caused the dawn to know its place,
18:38:13/So that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
18:38:14/The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
18:38:15/But the light of the wicked is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken.
18:38:16/Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
18:38:17/Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
18:38:18/Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.
18:38:19/Where does light reside, and where is the place of darkness,
18:38:20/That you might lead it to its boundaries and discern the paths to its home?
18:38:21/Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!
18:38:22/Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,
18:38:23/Which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?
18:38:24/What is the path to where lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
18:38:25/Who has cut a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
18:38:26/To water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited desert,
18:38:27/To satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
18:38:28/Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
18:38:29/From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
18:38:30/When the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?
18:38:31/Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?
18:38:32/Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?
18:38:33/Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's dominion over the earth?
18:38:34/Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?
18:38:35/Can you send lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?
18:38:36/Who has put wisdom in the innermost being or given understanding to the mind?
18:38:37/Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
18:38:38/When the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?
18:38:39/Can you hunt the prey for the lion or satisfy the hunger of the young lions
18:38:40/When they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?
18:38:41/Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
18:39:1/Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Can you watch when the deer gives birth?
18:39:2/Can you count the months they carry their young? Do you know the time they give birth?
18:39:3/They crouch down, they give birth to their young, they get rid of their pain.
18:39:4/Their offspring thrive and grow strong in the wild; they leave and do not return.
18:39:5/Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has untied the ropes of the wild donkey?
18:39:6/I have made the wilderness its home, and the salt flats its habitat.
18:39:7/It laughs at the commotion of the town; it does not hear the shouts of a driver.
18:39:8/It roams the mountains for its pasture and searches for any green thing.
18:39:9/Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will it stay by your manger at night?
18:39:10/Can you hold the wild ox in a furrow with a harness? Will it plow the valleys behind you?
18:39:11/Would you rely on it for its great strength? Would you leave your heavy work to it?
18:39:12/Can you trust it to haul in your grain and bring it to your threshing floor?
18:39:13/Did you give the peacock its beautiful wings, or wings and feathers to the ostrich?
18:39:14/Which leaves its eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust,
18:39:15/Forgetting that a foot might crush them, or that wild animals might trample them.
18:39:16/She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she is unconcerned that her labor might be in vain,
18:39:17/Because God has not endowed her with wisdom, nor given her a share of understanding.
18:39:18/Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.
18:39:19/Have you given the horse its strength? Have you clothed its neck with a mane that quivers?
18:39:20/Can you make it leap like a locust? Its majestic snorting is terrifying.
18:39:21/It paws in the valley and rejoices in its strength; it charges into the fray.
18:39:22/It laughs at fear, unafraid; it does not shy away from the sword.
18:39:23/The quiver rattles against it, along with the flashing spear and shield.
18:39:24/With fierce and raging excitement it swallows the ground; it cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
18:39:25/At the trumpet's blast it snorts, 'Aha!' It smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the war cry.
18:39:26/Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, stretching her wings toward the south?
18:39:27/Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes her nest on high?
18:39:28/She lives and stays on the rock, on the crag of the rock and the stronghold.
18:39:29/From there she seeks out food; her eyes detect it from afar.
18:39:30/Her young ones also suck up blood; and where the slain are, there she is.
18:40:1/Furthermore, the LORD responded to Job, saying,
18:40:2/Does the one who argues with the Almighty think they can teach Him? Anyone who criticizes God, let them respond.
18:40:3/Then Job replied to the LORD, saying,
18:40:4/I am insignificant; what can I possibly say to you? I will cover my mouth with my hand.
18:40:5/I have spoken once, but I will not speak again; yes, twice, but I will add nothing more.
18:40:6/Then the LORD answered Job from the storm, saying,
18:40:7/Prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform me.
18:40:8/Do you also wish to nullify my judgment? Do you condemn me so you can be declared righteous?
18:40:9/Do you have an arm like God's? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?
18:40:10/Now adorn yourself with majesty and splendor; clothe yourself with glory and beauty.
18:40:11/Unleash the fury of your anger; look at everyone who is proud and humble them.
18:40:12/Observe everyone who is proud, bring them down; and crush the wicked where they stand.
18:40:13/Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in obscurity.
18:40:14/Then I will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
18:40:15/Look now at the behemoth, which I created just as I created you; it eats grass like an ox.
18:40:16/See now, its strength is in its hips, and its power is in the muscles of its belly.
18:40:17/It sways its tail like a cedar; the tendons of its thighs are tightly knit.
18:40:18/Its bones are like tubes of bronze; its limbs are like bars of iron.
18:40:19/It ranks first among the works of God; only its Maker can approach it with His sword.
18:40:20/The mountains yield food for it, where all the wild animals play.
18:40:21/It lies under the lotus plants, in the shelter of the reeds and marsh.
18:40:22/The lotus trees cover it with their shade; the willows by the brook surround it.
18:40:23/Behold, it drinks up a river and is not alarmed; it is confident, though the Jordan rushes into its mouth.
18:40:24/It catches sight with its eyes; its nostrils pierce through traps.
18:41:1/Can you catch Leviathan with a hook, or trap his tongue with a line you lower?
18:41:2/Can you put a hook into his nose, or pierce his jaw with a spike?
18:41:3/Will he beg you for mercy or speak gently to you?
18:41:4/Will he make a deal with you, to serve you forever?
18:41:5/Can you play with him like a bird, or tie him up for your girls?
18:41:6/Will your friends have a feast with him, will they divide him up among the traders?
18:41:7/Can you fill his skin with harpoons, or his head with fishing spears?
18:41:8/Touch him once and you'll never forget the battle that follows.
18:41:9/See, any hope of subduing him is false; will not one be overwhelmed at just the sight of him?
18:41:10/No one is so brave that they dare stir him up. Who then can stand against me?
18:41:11/Who has given to me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
18:41:12/I will not hide his limbs, his mighty power, or his graceful proportions.
18:41:13/Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can penetrate his double coat of armor?
18:41:14/Who can open the doors of his face, ringed about with fearsome teeth?
18:41:15/His back is made of rows of shields, shut up tightly as with a seal.
18:41:16/Each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
18:41:17/They are joined to one another, they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
18:41:18/His sneezing flashes forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of dawn.
18:41:19/Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap out.
18:41:20/Smoke pours from his nostrils, as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
18:41:21/His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.
18:41:22/Strength resides in his neck, and despair turns into joy before him.
18:41:23/The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
18:41:24/His heart is as hard as stone, even as hard as a lower millstone.
18:41:25/When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.
18:41:26/The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
18:41:27/He treats iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.
18:41:28/Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are turned to rubble against him.
18:41:29/Clubs are regarded as straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.
18:41:30/His undersides are like sharp potsherds; he spreads jagged marks in the mud.
18:41:31/He makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
18:41:32/Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.
18:41:33/On earth, there is nothing like him, a creature without fear.
18:41:34/He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.
18:42:1/Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
18:42:2/I know that you can do everything, and that no thought can be hidden from you.
18:42:3/Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore, I have spoken of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
18:42:4/Listen, please, and I will speak: I will ask you, and you inform me.
18:42:5/I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you.
18:42:6/Therefore, I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
18:42:7/And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
18:42:8/Therefore, take for yourselves now seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken of me what is right, like my servant Job.
18:42:9/So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
18:42:10/And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
18:42:11/Then all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him, and ate bread with him in his house: and they consoled him, and comforted him over all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him: each one also gave him a piece of money, and each a gold earring.
18:42:12/So the LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.
18:42:13/He also had seven sons and three daughters.
18:42:14/And he named the first Jemima; and the second, Kezia; and the third, Kerenhappuch.
18:42:15/And in all the land no women were found as beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
18:42:16/After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, to four generations.
18:42:17/So Job died, old and full of days.
19:1:1/Happy is the person who doesn't follow the advice of the wicked, doesn't stand in the path of sinners, nor sits in the company of mockers.
19:1:2/But finds joy in the teachings of the LORD, meditating on them day and night.
19:1:3/They will be like a tree planted by streams of water, producing fruit in its season, whose leaves do not wither, and everything they do will succeed.
19:1:4/The wicked are not like this; instead, they are like chaff that the wind blows away.
19:1:5/Therefore, the wicked will not withstand judgment, nor will sinners be part of the gathering of the righteous.
19:1:6/For the LORD watches over the path of the righteous, but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.
19:2:1/Why do nations rebel, and the people plot futile things?
19:2:2/The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers conspire together, against the LORD and against his anointed one, saying,
19:2:3/"Let's break their chains and throw off their shackles."
19:2:4/The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.
19:2:5/Then he will speak to them in his anger and terrify them in his fury.
19:2:6/Yet I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.
19:2:7/I will proclaim the LORD's decree: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your father.
19:2:8/Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.
19:2:9/You will break them with a rod of iron; you will shatter them like pottery."
19:2:10/So now, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
19:2:11/Serve the LORD with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling.
19:2:12/Pay homage to the Son, lest he become angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
19:3:1/Lord, how the number of my troubles has increased! Many are those who rise up against me.
19:3:2/Many are saying about me, "God won't save him." Selah.
19:3:3/But you, O LORD, are a shield around me; my glory, and the one who lifts my head high.
19:3:4/I called out to the LORD with my voice, and he answered me from his holy mountain. Selah.
19:3:5/I lay down and slept; I woke up again because the LORD supported me.
19:3:6/I will not fear even if tens of thousands assail me on every side.
19:3:7/Rise up, O LORD; save me, my God! For you have struck all my enemies on the jaw; you have broken the teeth of the wicked.
19:3:8/Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing is on your people. Selah.
19:4:1/Listen to me when I call, O God who makes me right: you've given me space when I was under pressure; be merciful to me, and listen to my prayer.
19:4:2/Hey, people, how long will you turn my honor into disgrace? How long will you chase after what's meaningless and pursue lies? Pause and think.
19:4:3/But understand that the LORD has chosen the devout for himself: the LORD will listen when I call to him.
19:4:4/Be amazed, and don't sin: talk with your own heart on your bed, and be quiet. Pause and think.
19:4:5/Make your sacrifices out of what's right, and place your trust in the LORD.
19:4:6/There are many who ask, "Who can show us anything good?" LORD, let the light of your face shine on us.
19:4:7/You have filled my heart with joy, more than when their grain and wine abound.
19:4:8/I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, LORD, make me live in safety.
19:5:1/Listen to my words, O LORD, pay attention to my thoughts.
19:5:2/Pay attention to my cry for help, my King and my God, because I will pray to you.
19:5:3/You will hear my voice in the morning, O LORD; in the morning, I will send my prayers to you and wait expectantly.
19:5:4/For you are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; wickedness cannot dwell with you.
19:5:5/The foolish cannot stand in your presence; you despise all who do wrong.
19:5:6/You will destroy those who tell lies; the LORD detests the violent and deceitful.
19:5:7/But as for me, I will enter your house because of your great mercy; in reverence, I will bow down towards your holy temple.
19:5:8/Guide me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way clear before me.
19:5:9/There is nothing reliable in what they say; their innermost self is full of malice; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
19:5:10/Eliminate them, O God; let them be caught in their own schemes; throw them out for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
19:5:11/But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them always sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
19:5:12/For you, LORD, will bless the righteous; you will surround them with your favor as with a shield.
19:6:1/O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.
19:6:2/Have mercy on me, O LORD; for I am frail: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are deeply troubled.
19:6:3/My soul is also deeply troubled: but you, O LORD, how long will it be?
19:6:4/Come back, O LORD, rescue my soul: save me because of your kindness.
19:6:5/For in death there is no memory of you: in the grave who will praise you?
19:6:6/I am exhausted from my moaning; every night my bed is drenched; I soak my couch with my tears.
19:6:7/My eye is dimmed because of sorrow; it grows old because of all my adversaries.
19:6:8/Go away from me, all you who do evil; for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
19:6:9/The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD will accept my prayer.
19:6:10/May all my enemies be disgraced and deeply troubled: may they turn back and be disgraced suddenly.
19:7:1/O LORD my God, I trust in you: save me from all who persecute me, and rescue me:
19:7:2/So they don't tear my soul apart like a lion, shredding it, with no one to save me.
19:7:3/O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is wrongdoing in my hands;
19:7:4/If I have repaid someone with evil who was at peace with me; (indeed, I have even helped the one who was unjustly my enemy:)
19:7:5/Let the enemy chase after my soul, and capture it; let him trample my life to the ground, and lay my honor in the dust. Pause and think about that.
19:7:6/Rise up, O LORD, in your anger, stand up against the fury of my enemies: and wake up for me to the judgment you have ordered.
19:7:7/Then the assembly of the people will surround you: for their sake, therefore, rise to your throne.
19:7:8/The LORD will judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and the integrity that is within me.
19:7:9/Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous: for the just God examines the heart and mind.
19:7:10/My defense comes from God, who saves those who are pure in heart.
19:7:11/God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every single day.
19:7:12/If they do not turn, he will sharpen his sword; he has drawn his bow, and prepared it.
19:7:13/He has also prepared deadly weapons for them; he makes his arrows fiery shafts against the persecutors.
19:7:14/See, they are in labor with evil, they conceive trouble, and give birth to lies.
19:7:15/They dig a pit, and excavate it, and then fall into the hole they have made.
19:7:16/Their trouble will come back on their own heads, and their violence will descend on their own skulls.
19:7:17/I will praise the LORD for his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
19:8:1/O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth! You have set your glory higher than the heavens.
19:8:2/From the mouths of infants and nursing babies, you have established strength because of your adversaries, to silence the enemy and the avenger.
19:8:3/When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place;
19:8:4/What is humanity, that you think of them? And the children of man, that you care for them?
19:8:5/For you have made them slightly less than divine beings, and have crowned them with glory and honor.
19:8:6/You have given them authority over the works of your hands; you have put everything under their feet:
19:8:7/All sheep and oxen, indeed, and the wild animals of the field;
19:8:8/The birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, and whatever swims the paths of the seas.
19:8:9/O LORD our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth!
19:9:1/I will praise you, LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
19:9:2/I will be joyful and delighted in you; I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.
19:9:3/When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before you.
19:9:4/For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging fairly.
19:9:5/You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked, you have erased their name forever and ever.
19:9:6/O enemy, your destructions are finished forever; and you have demolished cities; their very memory has perished with them.
19:9:7/But the LORD will reign forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
19:9:8/He will judge the world with righteousness; he will govern the peoples with fairness.
19:9:9/The LORD will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
19:9:10/And those who know your name will trust in you; for you, LORD, have never abandoned those who seek you.
19:9:11/Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim his deeds among the peoples.
19:9:12/When he avenges blood, he remembers them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
19:9:13/Be gracious to me, O LORD; see my affliction from those who hate me, you who lift me up from the gates of death,
19:9:14/So that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in your salvation.
19:9:15/The nations have fallen into the pit they made; in the net they hid, their own feet have been caught.
19:9:16/The LORD is known by the justice he executes; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
19:9:17/The wicked will be turned into hell, along with all the nations that forget God.
19:9:18/For the needy will not always be forgotten; the hope of the poor will not perish forever.
19:9:19/Rise up, O LORD; let not mortals prevail; let the nations be judged in your presence.
19:9:20/Instill fear in them, O LORD; let the nations know they are only human. Selah.
19:10:1/Why do you stand so far away, O LORD? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
19:10:2/The wicked, in their pride, persecute the poor: let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
19:10:3/For the wicked brag about their heart’s desire, and bless the greedy, whom the LORD detests.
19:10:4/The wicked, through the arrogance of their demeanor, do not seek God: God is not in any of their thoughts.
19:10:5/Their ways are always distressing; your judgments are out of their sight: as for all their enemies, they scoff at them.
19:10:6/They say to themselves, I will not be shaken: for I will never face hardship.
19:10:7/Their mouths are full of cursing, lies, and deceit; under their tongues are trouble and evil.
19:10:8/They sit in ambush in the villages; in hidden places they murder the innocent: their eyes stealthily watch for the helpless.
19:10:9/They lie in wait like a lion in its den; they lie in wait to catch the helpless: they catch the helpless when they draw them into their net.
19:10:10/They crouch and lower themselves, so that the helpless may fall by their strong hands.
19:10:11/They think, God has forgotten; he has hidden his face; he will never see it.
19:10:12/Rise up, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand: do not forget the humble.
19:10:13/Why does the wicked scorn God? They think in their heart, You will not call us to account.
19:10:14/But you see the trouble and grief; you consider it to take it into your hands. The helpless commits themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
19:10:15/Break the arm of the wicked and the evil person; search out their wickedness until you find none.
19:10:16/The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from his land.
19:10:17/LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble; you will strengthen their heart, you will incline your ear
19:10:18/To defend the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere mortals will no longer terrify them.
19:11:1/I put my trust in the LORD: why do you tell me to flee like a bird to the mountains?
19:11:2/See, the wicked are drawing their bows, they set their arrows on the strings, ready to secretly shoot at those who are upright in heart.
19:11:3/If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
19:11:4/The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: he watches and examines the sons and daughters of humanity.
19:11:5/The LORD tests the righteous, but he despises the wicked and those who love violence.
19:11:6/He will rain down traps, fire and sulfur, and a terrifying storm on the wicked: this will be their lot.
19:11:7/For the LORD, who is righteous, loves righteous deeds; his gaze is upon those who are upright.
19:12:1/Help, LORD; for the godly person is no more; the faithful have vanished from among humanity.
19:12:2/Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts.
19:12:3/The LORD will eliminate all who flatter and boast arrogantly.
19:12:4/Those who say, "We will triumph with our tongues; we own our lips—who is our master?"
19:12:5/Because of the oppression of the poor and the groans of the needy, I will now arise, says the LORD; I will provide safety for those who are scorned.
19:12:6/The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over.
19:12:7/You, O LORD, will protect them; You will preserve them from this generation forever.
19:12:8/The wicked prowl on every side when the vilest of humanity are elevated.
19:13:1/How long will you forget me, O LORD? Forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
19:13:2/How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and have sadness in my heart every day? How long will my enemy triumph over me?
19:13:3/Pay attention and answer me, O LORD my God: brighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death;
19:13:4/So my enemy won't say, "I have defeated him"; and my foes won't rejoice when I falter.
19:13:5/Yet I have trusted in your unfailing love; my heart will rejoice in your salvation.
19:13:6/I will sing to the LORD, for he has been generous to me.
19:14:1/The fool says in their heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.
19:14:2/The LORD looks down from heaven on all humanity to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
19:14:3/Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
19:14:4/Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the LORD.
19:14:5/There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.
19:14:6/You shame the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.
19:14:7/If only salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.
19:15:1/Lord, who can stay in your sacred tent? Who can live on your holy mountain?
19:15:2/Someone who lives with integrity, does what is right, and speaks the truth from their heart.
19:15:3/Someone who doesn't slander with their tongue, doesn't harm their neighbor, nor spreads rumors about them.
19:15:4/Someone who despises a vile person but honors those who respect the LORD. Someone who keeps their promises even when it hurts and does not change their mind.
19:15:5/Someone who doesn't lend money at interest or take a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will stand firm forever.
19:16:1/Protect me, O God, for I place my trust in you.
19:16:2/My soul, you have declared to the LORD, "You are my Lord; my goodness doesn't reach you;
19:16:3/But it is for the saints on earth, and the noble, in whom I find all my joy.
19:16:4/Those who chase after other gods will multiply their sorrows; I will not pour out offerings of blood to them, nor will I speak their names.
19:16:5/The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my destiny.
19:16:6/I have landed in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
19:16:7/I will praise the LORD, who has advised me; even at night, my heart guides me.
19:16:8/I keep the LORD constantly before me; because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
19:16:9/Therefore, my heart is joyful, and my soul rejoices; my body also will rest in hope.
19:16:10/For you will not abandon my soul to the grave; nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
19:16:11/You will show me the way of life; being in your presence brings complete joy; at your right hand, there are eternal pleasures.
19:17:1/Listen to what is right, LORD, pay attention to my cry, listen to my prayer that comes from sincere lips.
19:17:2/Let my judgment come directly from you; let your eyes see what is fair.
19:17:3/You have tested my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and will find nothing wrong; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.
19:17:4/Regarding the actions of people, by the words of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
19:17:5/Guide my steps in your paths, so that my feet do not slip.
19:17:6/I have called on you, because you will answer me, God: turn your ear to me, and listen to my words.
19:17:7/Show your wonderful love, O you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their adversaries.
19:17:8/Protect me as the apple of your eye, hide me in the shadow of your wings,
19:17:9/From the wicked who do me harm, from my mortal enemies who surround me.
19:17:10/They are closed in by their own fat: with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
19:17:11/They have now surrounded us in our steps; they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.
19:17:12/Like a lion eager for its prey, and like a young lion lurking in hiding places.
19:17:13/Rise up, LORD, confront them, bring them down: rescue my life from the wicked, who are your instruments.
19:17:14/From people who are your hand, LORD, from people of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly you fill with your hidden treasure: they are satisfied with children, and leave their abundance to their offspring.
19:17:15/As for me, I will see your face in righteousness: I will be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your likeness.
19:18:1/I will love you, O LORD, my strength.
19:18:2/The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
19:18:3/I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy of praise: so I will be saved from my enemies.
19:18:4/The pains of death surrounded me, and the floods of wickedness made me afraid.
19:18:5/The pains of hell surrounded me: the traps of death confronted me.
19:18:6/In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice from his temple, and my cry came before him, into his ears.
19:18:7/Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the mountains trembled and were shaken, because he was angry.
19:18:8/Smoke rose from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; coals were ignited by it.
19:18:9/He parted the heavens and came down; darkness was under his feet.
19:18:10/And he rode upon a cherub, and flew; yes, he flew upon the wings of the wind.
19:18:11/He made darkness his hiding place; his canopy around him was dark waters and thick clouds.
19:18:12/At the brightness before him, his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.
19:18:13/The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice; hailstones and coals of fire.
19:18:14/Yes, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and confused them.
19:18:15/Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were revealed at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
19:18:16/He reached down from on high, he took me; he drew me out of deep waters.
19:18:17/He rescued me from my powerful enemy, and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
19:18:18/They confronted me in the day of my disaster: but the LORD was my support.
19:18:19/He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.
19:18:20/The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has repaid me.
19:18:21/For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
19:18:22/For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
19:18:23/I was also blameless before him, and I kept myself from my sin.
19:18:24/Therefore the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
19:18:25/With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with an upright man you show yourself upright;
19:18:26/With the pure you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
19:18:27/For you will save the afflicted people; but will bring down high looks.
19:18:28/For you will light my lamp: the LORD my God will illuminate my darkness.
19:18:29/For by you I have run through a troop; and by my God I have leaped over a wall.
19:18:30/As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is proven: he is a shield to all those that trust in him.
19:18:31/For who is God except the LORD? or who is a rock except our God?
19:18:32/It is God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect.
19:18:33/He makes my feet like the feet of a deer, and sets me on my high places.
19:18:34/He trains my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
19:18:35/You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your right hand has held me up, and your gentleness has made me great.
19:18:36/You have broadened my path beneath me, so that my ankles did not turn.
19:18:37/I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back until they were destroyed.
19:18:38/I crushed them so they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
19:18:39/For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rose against me bow down under me.
19:18:40/You also gave me the necks of my enemies, so that I might destroy those who hate me.
19:18:41/They cried for help, but there was no one to save them; they even cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
19:18:42/Then I beat them as fine as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mud in the streets.
19:18:43/You have delivered me from the strife of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I had not known serve me.
19:18:44/As soon as they hear of me, they obey me; foreigners submit to me.
19:18:45/Foreigners lose heart and come trembling out of their fortresses.
19:18:46/The LORD lives; blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
19:18:47/It is God who avenges me, and subdues peoples under me.
19:18:48/He delivers me from my enemies; indeed, you lift me up above those who rise against me; you have rescued me from the violent man.
19:18:49/Therefore I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to your name.
19:18:50/Great salvation he brings to his king; and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his descendants forever.
19:19:1/The sky displays the majesty of God; the expanse shows the work of his hands.
19:19:2/Each day tells the next one, and each night reveals knowledge to the next.
19:19:3/There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
19:19:4/Their message has spread throughout the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. He has set a home in the heavens for the sun,
19:19:5/Which is like a groom leaving his room, and celebrates like an athlete eager to run a race.
19:19:6/It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.
19:19:7/The law of the LORD is flawless, refreshing the soul: the decree of the LORD is trustworthy, giving wisdom to the simple.
19:19:8/The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart: the command of the LORD is clear, giving insight for living.
19:19:9/Revering the LORD is pure, lasting forever: the decrees of the LORD are true, completely righteous.
19:19:10/They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold; they are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb.
19:19:11/Also, by them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
19:19:12/Who can discern their own mistakes? Forgive my hidden faults.
19:19:13/Also keep your servant from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great sin.
19:19:14/May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
19:20:1/May the LORD listen to you in times of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you;
19:20:2/Send you help from his holy place, and give you support from Zion;
19:20:3/Remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifices; Selah.
19:20:4/Give you what your heart desires, and make all your plans succeed.
19:20:5/We will celebrate your victory, and in the name of our God we will raise our flags: may the LORD grant all your requests.
19:20:6/Now I am certain that the LORD saves his chosen one; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the victorious power of his right hand.
19:20:7/Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will trust in the name of the LORD our God.
19:20:8/They are brought down and fall, but we rise and stand firm.
19:20:9/Save us, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
19:21:1/The king rejoices in your strength, O LORD; how greatly he celebrates your salvation!
19:21:2/You have granted him his heart's desire and have not denied the request of his lips. Selah.
19:21:3/You welcomed him with rich blessings; you placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
19:21:4/He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—length of days, forever and ever.
19:21:5/His glory is magnified by your salvation; you have bestowed upon him honor and majesty.
19:21:6/You have made him extremely blessed forever; you have filled him with joy by your presence.
19:21:7/The king trusts in the LORD, and through the kindness of the Most High, he will not be shaken.
19:21:8/Your hand will reach all your enemies; your right hand will reach those who hate you.
19:21:9/You will make them like a fiery furnace when you appear in anger; the LORD will engulf them in his wrath, and the fire will consume them.
19:21:10/You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among humanity.
19:21:11/For they plotted evil against you; they devised a scheme they cannot carry out.
19:21:12/Therefore, you will make them turn their backs when you aim your arrows at them.
19:21:13/Be exalted, O LORD, in your own strength; we will sing and praise your might.
19:22:1/My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why are you so far from saving me, and from hearing my cries of anguish?
19:22:2/Oh my God, I cry out during the day, but you do not answer; and at night, but I find no rest.
19:22:3/Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
19:22:4/Our ancestors put their trust in you; they trusted, and you rescued them.
19:22:5/They cried out to you and were saved; they trusted in you and were not disappointed.
19:22:6/But I am a worm, not even human; scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
19:22:7/All who see me mock me; they sneer and shake their heads, saying,
19:22:8/"He relied on the Lord; let the Lord rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him."
19:22:9/But you are the one who brought me forth from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother's breasts.
19:22:10/From birth I was cast on you; from my mother's womb, you have been my God.
19:22:11/Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
19:22:12/Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
19:22:13/They open their mouths wide at me, like a tearing and roaring lion.
19:22:14/I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of place. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted within me.
19:22:15/My strength is dried up like a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
19:22:16/For dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.
19:22:17/I can count all my bones. People stare and gloat over me.
19:22:18/They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.
19:22:19/But you, O Lord, do not be far off. O my Strength, come quickly to help me.
19:22:20/Rescue my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.
19:22:21/Save me from the lion's mouth; from the horns of the wild oxen, you have answered me.
19:22:22/I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly, I will praise you.
19:22:23/You who fear the Lord, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
19:22:24/For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.
19:22:25/My praise comes from you in the great assembly; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear him.
19:22:26/The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the Lord will praise him—may your hearts live forever!
19:22:27/All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him,
19:22:28/For dominion belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations.
19:22:29/All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—those who cannot keep themselves alive.
19:22:30/Future generations will serve him; they will be told about the Lord to the coming generation.
19:22:31/They will proclaim his righteousness, declaring to a people yet unborn: He has done it.
19:23:1/The LORD is my shepherd; I lack nothing.
19:23:2/He makes me lie down in lush meadows; he guides me beside calm waters.
19:23:3/He rejuvenates my soul; he leads me along paths of righteousness, honoring his name.
19:23:4/Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid: for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
19:23:5/You prepare a feast for me in front of my enemies; you bless me by anointing my head with oil; my cup overflows.
19:23:6/Indeed, goodness and love will pursue me all the days of my life: and I will live in the house of the LORD forever.
19:24:1/The earth belongs to the LORD, and everything in it; the world, and all who live in it.
19:24:2/For he established it on the seas and set it firmly on the waters.
19:24:3/Who can climb the mountain of the LORD? Who can stand in his sacred place?
19:24:4/Only those with clean hands and a pure heart; who have not given their soul to falsehood, nor sworn deceitfully.
19:24:5/They will receive a blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God who saves them.
19:24:6/These are the people who seek him, who seek your face, O Jacob. Selah.
19:24:7/Open up, you gates; open wide, you ancient doors, so the King of glory may come in.
19:24:8/Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle.
19:24:9/Open up, you gates; open them wide, you ancient doors, so the King of glory may come in.
19:24:10/Who is this King of glory? The LORD Almighty, he is the King of glory. Selah.
19:25:1/To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
19:25:2/My God, I trust in you: let me not be put to shame; don't let my enemies gloat over me.
19:25:3/Indeed, let no one who waits on you be put to shame; let those be ashamed who act treacherously without cause.
19:25:4/Show me your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths.
19:25:5/Guide me in your truth and teach me: for you are the God of my salvation; I wait for you all day long.
19:25:6/Remember, O LORD, your compassion and your unfailing love; for they have been from of old.
19:25:7/Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions: according to your mercy remember me, for your goodness’ sake, O LORD.
19:25:8/Good and upright is the LORD: therefore, he instructs sinners in his ways.
19:25:9/He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
19:25:10/All the ways of the LORD are loving and faithful toward those who keep his covenant and his decrees.
19:25:11/For your name’s sake, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
19:25:12/Who is the man who fears the LORD? Him will he instruct in the way chosen for him.
19:25:13/He will spend his days in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.
19:25:14/The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.
19:25:15/My eyes are always on the LORD, for he will free my feet from the snare.
19:25:16/Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
19:25:17/Relieve the troubles of my heart and free me from my anguish.
19:25:18/Look on my affliction and my distress and take away all my sins.
19:25:19/See how numerous are my enemies and how fiercely they hate me!
19:25:20/Guard my life and rescue me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
19:25:21/May integrity and uprightness protect me, because my hope, LORD, is in you.
19:25:22/Rescue Israel, O God, from all their troubles.
19:26:1/Judge me, O LORD; for I have lived with integrity: I have also trusted in the LORD; therefore, I will not falter.
19:26:2/Test me, O LORD, and examine me; assess my deepest thoughts and my heart.
19:26:3/For your steadfast love is always before me: and I have lived according to your truth.
19:26:4/I have not associated with deceitful people, nor will I keep company with hypocrites.
19:26:5/I have despised the gathering of those who do evil; and I will not sit with the wicked.
19:26:6/I will wash my hands in innocence: and so I will approach your altar, O LORD:
19:26:7/So that I may raise my voice in thanksgiving, and recount all your marvelous deeds.
19:26:8/LORD, I have cherished the dwelling of your house, and the place where your glory resides.
19:26:9/Do not group my soul with sinners, nor my life with those who are violent:
19:26:10/Who have schemes in their hands, and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
19:26:11/But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and show me mercy.
19:26:12/My feet stand on solid ground: in the assemblies, I will praise the LORD.
19:27:1/The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
19:27:2/When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, approached me to devour me, they stumbled and fell.
19:27:3/Even if an army surrounds me, my heart won't fear; even if war breaks out against me, I will remain confident.
19:27:4/There's one thing I've asked from the LORD, and I'll pursue it: to live in the LORD's house all my life, to gaze upon the LORD's beauty, and to seek guidance in his temple.
19:27:5/For in times of trouble, he will conceal me in his shelter; in the secrecy of his tent, he will hide me; he will lift me high upon a rock.
19:27:6/And now my head will be raised above my surrounding enemies; therefore, I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.
19:27:7/Hear me, O LORD, when I cry out; be merciful to me and answer me.
19:27:8/When you said, "Seek my face," my heart responded, "Your face, LORD, I will seek."
19:27:9/Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my help; do not leave me or forsake me, O God of my salvation.
19:27:10/When my father and my mother abandon me, then the LORD will take care of me.
19:27:11/Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.
19:27:12/Do not hand me over to the desires of my foes; for false witnesses have risen against me, spouting malice.
19:27:13/I would have lost hope if I had not believed I would see the LORD's goodness in the land of the living.
19:27:14/Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD.
19:28:1/I will call out to you, O LORD, my rock; do not ignore me, for if you remain silent, I might as well be one of those descending into the grave.
19:28:2/Listen to my pleas for mercy when I call out to you, when I raise my hands toward your holy sanctuary.
19:28:3/Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak kindly to their neighbors while plotting harm in their hearts.
19:28:4/Reward them according to their actions and the evil of their schemes; pay them back for what their hands have done, give them what they deserve.
19:28:5/Because they pay no attention to the works of the LORD or the deeds of his hands, he will tear them down and not build them up again.
19:28:6/Blessed be the LORD, for he has heard my plea for mercy.
19:28:7/The LORD is my strength and my protector; my heart trusts in him, and I have been helped. Therefore, my heart is joyful, and I will praise him with my song.
19:28:8/The LORD gives strength to his people; he is the fortress of salvation for his anointed.
19:28:9/Save your people and bless your heritage; care for them and lift them up forever.
19:29:1/Give to the LORD, you mighty ones, give to the LORD glory and strength.
19:29:2/Give to the LORD the glory he deserves; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.
19:29:3/The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the glorious God thunders; the LORD is over vast waters.
19:29:4/The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.
19:29:5/The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; indeed, the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
19:29:6/He makes them leap like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.
19:29:7/The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire.
19:29:8/The voice of the LORD shakes the desert; the LORD shakes the desert of Kadesh.
19:29:9/The voice of the LORD causes the deer to give birth and strips the forests bare; and in his temple, everyone shouts, "Glory!"
19:29:10/The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; indeed, the LORD sits as King forever.
19:29:11/The LORD will give strength to his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
19:30:1/I will praise you, O LORD; for you have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies gloat over me.
19:30:2/O LORD my God, I called out to you, and you healed me.
19:30:3/O LORD, you have raised my soul from the grave: you have kept me alive, so that I would not descend into the pit.
19:30:4/Sing to the LORD, O his faithful ones, and give thanks at the memory of his holiness.
19:30:5/For his anger lasts only a moment; in his favor is life: crying may last for a night, but joy arrives in the morning.
19:30:6/And in my prosperity I thought, I shall never be shaken.
19:30:7/LORD, by your favor you have made my mountain stand strong: when you hid your face, I was distressed.
19:30:8/I cried to you, O LORD; and to the LORD I pleaded for mercy.
19:30:9/What gain is there in my demise, when I descend to the pit? Can the dust praise you? Can it proclaim your truth?
19:30:10/Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me: LORD, be my aid.
19:30:11/You have turned my mourning into dancing for me: you have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with joy;
19:30:12/So that my soul may sing praise to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever.
19:31:1/In you, O LORD, I place my trust; let me never be put to shame: rescue me by your righteousness.
19:31:2/Turn your ear to me; save me quickly: be my solid rock, a fortress to protect me.
19:31:3/For you are my rock and my fortress; so for the sake of your name, lead me and guide me.
19:31:4/Rescue me from the trap they have secretly set for me: for you are my strength.
19:31:5/Into your hands I entrust my spirit: you have saved me, O LORD, God of truth.
19:31:6/I despise those who cling to worthless idols; but I trust in the LORD.
19:31:7/I will be joyful and rejoice in your mercy: for you have seen my affliction; you have known my soul in times of distress;
19:31:8/And you have not handed me over to the enemy: you have set my feet in a spacious place.
19:31:9/Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am in distress: my eyes are filled with sorrow, as well as my soul and my body.
19:31:10/For my life is consumed with sorrow, and my years with sighing: my strength fails because of my guilt, and my bones waste away.
19:31:11/I am scorned by all my enemies, especially by my neighbors, and dreaded by my acquaintances: those who see me outside flee from me.
19:31:12/I am forgotten as though I were dead, out of mind: I am like a shattered pot.
19:31:13/For I have heard the slander of many: fear is on every side: while they conspire against me, they plot to take my life.
19:31:14/But I trust in you, O LORD: I say, "You are my God."
19:31:15/My future is in your hands: rescue me from the clutches of my enemies, and from those who pursue me.
19:31:16/Let your face shine on your servant: save me in your unfailing love.
19:31:17/Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I call out to you: let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in the grave.
19:31:18/Silence the lying lips that speak boldly and with contempt against the righteous.
19:31:19/Oh, how immense is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you; which you have shown to those who trust in you, in the sight of everyone!
19:31:20/You hide them in the shelter of your presence from the conspiracies of people; you keep them safe in your dwelling from the strife of tongues.
19:31:21/Blessed be the LORD: for he has shown me his amazing kindness in a fortified city.
19:31:22/For I said in my panic, I am cut off from your sight: yet you heard the sound of my pleas when I cried to you for help.
19:31:23/Love the LORD, all his saints: the LORD protects the faithful, but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride.
19:31:24/Be strong, and he will strengthen your heart, all you who hope in the LORD.
19:32:1/Happy is the one whose wrongdoing is forgiven, whose sin is covered up.
19:32:2/Happy is the person to whom the LORD does not count sin, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
19:32:3/When I kept silent, my bones aged from my constant groaning all day long.
19:32:4/For day and night your hand was heavy on me: my vitality turned into the dryness of summer. Selah.
19:32:5/I admitted my sin to you, and I did not conceal my wrongdoing. I decided to confess my sins to the LORD; and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah.
19:32:6/For this, everyone who is devout should pray to you at a time when you can be found: surely during the overwhelming floods, they will not reach him.
19:32:7/You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble; you will surround me with songs of rescue. Selah.
19:32:8/I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will advise you with my eye upon you.
19:32:9/Do not be like the horse or the mule, which lack understanding: they must be controlled with bit and bridle, or they will not come to you.
19:32:10/Many sorrows come to the wicked, but the one who trusts in the LORD will be surrounded by mercy.
19:32:11/Be joyful in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous: and shout for joy, all you who are honest in heart.
19:33:1/Celebrate in the LORD, you who are righteous: for praise is fitting for the upright.
19:33:2/Praise the LORD with the harp: sing to him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
19:33:3/Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise.
19:33:4/For the word of the LORD is true; and all his actions are done with honesty.
19:33:5/He loves righteousness and justice: the earth is filled with the goodness of the LORD.
19:33:6/By the word of the LORD the heavens were made; and all their stars by the breath of his mouth.
19:33:7/He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap: he stores the depths in storehouses.
19:33:8/Let all the earth respect the LORD: let all the people of the world stand in awe of him.
19:33:9/For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.
19:33:10/The LORD nullifies the plans of the nations; he thwarts the schemes of the peoples.
19:33:11/The plan of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of his heart through all generations.
19:33:12/Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people he has chosen as his own inheritance.
19:33:13/The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all humanity.
19:33:14/From his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth.
19:33:15/He shapes their hearts alike; he considers all their deeds.
19:33:16/No king is saved by a large army; a warrior is not delivered by great strength.
19:33:17/A horse is a false hope for safety; it cannot save by its great power.
19:33:18/Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love;
19:33:19/To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in times of famine.
19:33:20/Our soul waits for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
19:33:21/For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
19:33:22/Let your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, just as we hope in you.
19:34:1/I will always praise the LORD; his praise will always be on my lips.
19:34:2/My soul will boast in the LORD; the humble will hear it and rejoice.
19:34:3/Let's magnify the LORD together and lift up his name as one.
19:34:4/I looked for the LORD, and he answered me, freeing me from all my fears.
19:34:5/Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.
19:34:6/This poor man called out, and the LORD listened and saved him from all his troubles.
19:34:7/The angel of the LORD surrounds those who fear him and rescues them.
19:34:8/Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
19:34:9/Respect the LORD, you his holy people; those who fear him lack nothing.
19:34:10/Even strong lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
19:34:11/Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you to fear the LORD.
19:34:12/Who is the person who desires life, loving many days to see good?
19:34:13/Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies.
19:34:14/Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and chase after it.
19:34:15/The LORD's eyes are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry.
19:34:16/The LORD's face is against those who do evil, to erase their memory from the earth.
19:34:17/The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles.
19:34:18/The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
19:34:19/The righteous face many troubles, but the LORD delivers them from every one.
19:34:20/He protects all their bones; not one of them will be broken.
19:34:21/Evil will kill the wicked; those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
19:34:22/The LORD rescues his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.
19:35:1/Defend me, O LORD, against those who challenge me: stand up against those who confront me.
19:35:2/Grab your shield and armor, and come to my aid.
19:35:3/Ready your spear, and block the path of those who chase me: tell me that you are my salvation.
19:35:4/May those who seek my life be embarrassed and shamed; may those who plot my downfall be turned back and confused.
19:35:5/Let them be like chaff in the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them away.
19:35:6/May their path be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD pursue them.
19:35:7/For no reason, they have set a trap for me, digging a pit for my downfall without cause.
19:35:8/May destruction catch him off guard; and may he be ensnared by his own trap: into that very ruin may he fall.
19:35:9/And my soul will be joyful in the LORD: it will delight in his salvation.
19:35:10/Every part of me will say, LORD, who is like you, rescuing the weak from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them?
19:35:11/False witnesses rose against me; they accused me of things I did not do.
19:35:12/They repaid my kindness with evil, to the detriment of my soul.
19:35:13/Yet when they were ill, I wore sackcloth: I deprived my soul with fasting; and my prayer remained heartfelt.
19:35:14/I acted as if he were my friend or brother: I was deeply bowed down, mourning as one mourns for a mother.
19:35:15/But at my misfortune they rejoiced, gathering against me: indeed, the outcasts came together against me, and I was unaware; they attacked me without ceasing:
19:35:16/Among mocking feasters, they gnashed at me with their teeth.
19:35:17/Lord, how long will you just watch? Save my life from their ravages, my precious life from the lions.
19:35:18/I will thank you in the large assembly: I will praise you among many people.
19:35:19/Do not let those who are my enemies unjustly gloat over me: nor let those who despise me without reason smirk at my expense.
19:35:20/For they do not promote peace: instead, they plot deceitful schemes against those who live peacefully in the land.
19:35:21/Indeed, they opened their mouths wide against me, saying, "Aha, aha, we have seen it with our own eyes."
19:35:22/You have seen this, O LORD: do not remain silent: O Lord, do not stay far from me.
19:35:23/Rise up and come to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord.
19:35:24/Judge me according to your righteousness, O LORD my God; and do not let them gloat over me.
19:35:25/Do not let them think, "Just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up."
19:35:26/May those who rejoice at my trouble be ashamed and confused together; may those who boast against me be clothed with shame and dishonor.
19:35:27/Let those who support my just cause shout for joy and be glad; let them always say, "May the LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant."
19:35:28/And my tongue will talk of your righteousness and your praise all day long.
19:36:1/The wrongdoing of the wicked whispers to me that they have no respect for God.
19:36:2/He praises himself until his sins are too obvious to ignore.
19:36:3/His words are full of wrongdoing and lies; he has stopped being wise and doing good.
19:36:4/He plots harm while lying in bed; he commits himself to a harmful path and doesn't reject evil.
19:36:5/Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens; your faithfulness to the skies.
19:36:6/Your righteousness is as solid as the mountains; your judgments are as vast as the ocean: O LORD, you protect both people and animals.
19:36:7/Your kindness is so wonderful, O God! That's why people find refuge in the shadow of your wings.
19:36:8/They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.
19:36:9/For you are the source of life; in your light, we see light.
19:36:10/Keep showing your love to those who know you; your righteousness to the pure in heart.
19:36:11/Don't let the arrogant come against me, nor the wicked drive me away.
19:36:12/There the doers of evil have fallen; they are thrown down and cannot get up.
19:37:1/Don't worry about those who do wrong or be jealous of those who do harm.
19:37:2/They will quickly fade like grass and wither like green plants.
19:37:3/Trust in the LORD and do good; then you will live safely in the land and prosper.
19:37:4/Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you your heart's desires.
19:37:5/Commit everything you do to the LORD. Trust him, and he will help you.
19:37:6/He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn, and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.
19:37:7/Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; don't worry about those who prosper in their ways, those who carry out evil schemes.
19:37:8/Stop being angry! Turn from your rage! Do not lose your temper—it only leads to harm.
19:37:9/For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.
19:37:10/Soon the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.
19:37:11/But the humble will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.
19:37:12/The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them.
19:37:13/But the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
19:37:14/The wicked draw their swords and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.
19:37:15/But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
19:37:16/Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked.
19:37:17/For the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.
19:37:18/The LORD watches over the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will endure forever.
19:37:19/They will not be disgraced in hard times; even in famine they will have more than enough.
19:37:20/But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish—vanish like smoke.
19:37:21/The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously.
19:37:22/Those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be destroyed.
19:37:23/The LORD makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him.
19:37:24/Though they stumble, they will not fall, for the LORD upholds them with his hand.
19:37:25/I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.
19:37:26/They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be a blessing.
19:37:27/Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.
19:37:28/For the LORD loves justice and does not abandon his faithful ones. They are protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.
19:37:29/The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
19:37:30/The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, and their tongues speak what is just.
19:37:31/The law of their God is in their hearts; their feet do not slip.
19:37:32/The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, intent on putting them to death.
19:37:33/But the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial.
19:37:34/Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
19:37:35/I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading themselves like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.
19:37:36/But they soon passed away and were gone; I looked for them, but they could not be found.
19:37:37/Consider the blameless, observe the upright; a future awaits those who seek peace.
19:37:38/But all sinners will be destroyed; there will be no future for the wicked.
19:37:39/The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
19:37:40/The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
19:38:1/O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
19:38:2/Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and your hand weighs heavily on me.
19:38:3/My body is not healthy because of your anger; my bones have no peace because of my sin.
19:38:4/My wrongdoings have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear.
19:38:5/My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness.
19:38:6/I am distressed; I am deeply bowed down and mourn all day long.
19:38:7/My body is filled with a disgusting sickness; there is no health in my flesh.
19:38:8/I am weak and utterly crushed; I cry out due to the turmoil of my heart.
19:38:9/Lord, all my longing is known to you; my sighing is not hidden from you.
19:38:10/My heart races, my strength fails me; even the light of my eyes has dimmed.
19:38:11/My friends and loved ones keep their distance from my affliction; my relatives stand far away.
19:38:12/Those who seek my life set traps for me; those who wish me harm talk of ruin and plot deception all day long.
19:38:13/But I am like a deaf man, not hearing; like a mute who cannot open his mouth.
19:38:14/I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth offers no reply.
19:38:15/For I put my hope in you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.
19:38:16/I said, "Hear me, lest they gloat over me; when my foot slips, they boast against me."
19:38:17/For I am about to fall, and my pain is always with me.
19:38:18/I will confess my wrongdoing; I am troubled by my sin.
19:38:19/But my enemies are vigorous and strong; those who hate me without reason are numerous.
19:38:20/Those who repay my good with evil oppose me because I pursue what is good.
19:38:21/Do not abandon me, O LORD; O my God, do not be far from me.
19:38:22/Hurry to help me, O Lord my savior.
19:39:1/I said, I will be careful with my actions, so I don't sin with my words: I will guard my mouth carefully, especially when the wicked are around.
19:39:2/I kept silent, not even speaking what was good; and my sorrow grew.
19:39:3/My heart burned with emotion inside me, and as I thought about it, the fire grew: then I spoke out.
19:39:4/LORD, let me understand my life's end and how fleeting my days are: so I can grasp how fragile I am.
19:39:5/You have made my life span incredibly short; and in your sight, my lifetime is insignificant: indeed, at their best, humans are just a breath. Selah.
19:39:6/Indeed, people go about in a meaningless parade: they worry for nothing, amassing wealth without knowing who will enjoy it.
19:39:7/And now, Lord, what am I waiting for? My hope is in you.
19:39:8/Save me from all my wrongdoings: don't let me be mocked by fools.
19:39:9/I kept quiet, I didn't open my mouth; because you were the one acting.
19:39:10/Take away your punishment from me: I am worn out from your heavy hand.
19:39:11/When you discipline someone for their sins, their beauty fades away like a moth: indeed, every person is just a breath. Selah.
19:39:12/Listen to my prayer, O LORD, and pay attention to my cry; don't ignore my tears: for I am just a visitor with you, a temporary resident like my ancestors.
19:39:13/Give me a break, so I can gain strength, before I leave and am gone forever.
19:40:1/I waited patiently for the LORD; and he turned to me, and heard my cry.
19:40:2/He lifted me out of a terrible pit, out of the muddy mess, and set my feet on solid ground, stabilizing my steps.
19:40:3/He placed a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see it, be in awe, and put their trust in the LORD.
19:40:4/Blessed is the person who makes the LORD their trust, and does not look up to the arrogant or those who stray into falsehood.
19:40:5/LORD my God, your amazing deeds and your thoughts toward us are too numerous to count. If I tried to speak of them, they would outnumber the grains of sand.
19:40:6/You did not desire sacrifices or offerings; you have opened my ears. Burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.
19:40:7/Then I said, "Here I am, I have come—it is written about me in the scroll.
19:40:8/I take joy in doing your will, my God; your law is written in my heart."
19:40:9/I have proclaimed your righteousness in the great assembly; I have not kept my lips sealed, LORD, you know.
19:40:10/I have not hidden your righteousness in my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your love and your truth from the great assembly.
19:40:11/Do not withhold your mercy from me, LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.
19:40:12/Countless troubles have surrounded me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more numerous than the hairs on my head, and my heart fails within me.
19:40:13/Please, LORD, come to my rescue; LORD, hurry to help me.
19:40:14/May those who seek to take my life be disgraced and confused; may those who wish me harm be turned back in shame.
19:40:15/May those who mock me be left desolate as a repayment for their shame.
19:40:16/May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, "The LORD is great!"
19:40:17/Though I am poor and needy, the Lord thinks of me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God.
19:41:1/Happy is the one who thinks about the needy: the LORD will save him in times of trouble.
19:41:2/The LORD will protect him, and keep him alive; he will be fortunate on the earth: and you will not let him fall into the hands of his enemies.
19:41:3/The LORD will give him strength when he is weak in bed: you will make his bed comfortable in his illness.
19:41:4/I said, LORD, have mercy on me: heal my soul; for I have wronged you.
19:41:5/My enemies speak badly of me, asking, "When will he die, and his name be forgotten?"
19:41:6/And if he comes to see me, he speaks lies: his heart collects evil intentions; when he leaves, he spreads them.
19:41:7/All who hate me whisper together against me: they plot harm against me.
19:41:8/They say a terrible illness clings to him: and now that he is down, he will never get up again.
19:41:9/Even my close friend, whom I trusted, who shared my bread, has turned against me.
19:41:10/But you, O LORD, have mercy on me, and lift me up, so I can pay them back.
19:41:11/This shows me that you favor me, because my enemy does not gloat over me.
19:41:12/And as for me, you support me because of my integrity, and place me in your presence forever.
19:41:13/Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity. Amen, and Amen.
19:42:1/Just as a deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O God.
19:42:2/My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when can I go and meet with God?
19:42:3/My tears have been my food day and night, while people constantly ask me, "Where is your God?"
19:42:4/When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me: for I used to go with the crowd, I walked with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a crowd celebrating a festival.
19:42:5/Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Put your hope in God: for I will yet praise him for the help of his presence.
19:42:6/O my God, my soul is downcast within me: therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from Mount Mizar.
19:42:7/Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.
19:42:8/Yet the LORD will command his steadfast love during the day, and at night his song will be with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
19:42:9/I will say to God my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"
19:42:10/Like a dagger in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19:42:11/Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Put your hope in God: for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19:43:1/Judge me, O God, and defend my cause against a nation without godliness: O rescue me from deceitful and unjust people.
19:43:2/For you are the God of my strength: why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?
19:43:3/O send out your light and your truth: let them guide me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, and to your dwellings.
19:43:4/Then I will approach the altar of God, to God, my utmost joy: and on the harp, I will praise you, O God, my God.
19:43:5/Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God: for I will yet praise him, who is the salvation of my face, and my God.
19:44:1/We've heard it ourselves, O God, our ancestors have shared with us the deeds you performed in their time, long ago.
19:44:2/How you drove out the nations with your power, and settled our ancestors in their place; how you punished the peoples and expelled them.
19:44:3/They didn't take the land by their own strength or save themselves with their own efforts: but by your strong hand, your arm, and the light of your presence, because you favored them.
19:44:4/You are my King, O God: command victories for Jacob.
19:44:5/With your help, we will push back our adversaries: in your name, we will trample those who oppose us.
19:44:6/For I will not rely on my bow, nor will my sword bring me victory.
19:44:7/But you have saved us from our foes, and have put to shame those who hate us.
19:44:8/In God we boast all day long, and will praise your name forever. Selah.
19:44:9/Yet you have rejected us, brought us to disgrace, and do not go out with our armies.
19:44:10/You make us retreat before the enemy, and our haters plunder us at will.
19:44:11/You have made us like sheep to be slaughtered; and have scattered us among the nations.
19:44:12/You sell your people for nothing, and have not profited by their sale.
19:44:13/You have made us a mockery to our neighbors, a source of scorn and ridicule to those around us.
19:44:14/You have made us a joke among the nations, a people who are shaken their heads at.
19:44:15/I am constantly humiliated, and shame covers my face,
19:44:16/Because of the taunts and blasphemies of the enemy and avenger.
19:44:17/All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, nor have we been untrue to your covenant.
19:44:18/Our hearts have not turned back, nor have our steps strayed from your path;
19:44:19/Even though you have crushed us in the lair of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
19:44:20/If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
19:44:21/Wouldn't God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
19:44:22/Indeed, for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
19:44:23/Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord? Arise, do not reject us forever.
19:44:24/Why do you hide your face, forgetting our misery and oppression?
19:44:25/For our souls are bowed down to the dust: our bodies cling to the earth.
19:44:26/Rise up to help us, and redeem us because of your unfailing love.
19:45:1/My heart is overflowing with a noble theme; I am speaking of the things I have composed about the king: my tongue is like the pen of a skilled writer.
19:45:2/You are more beautiful than anyone; grace flows from your lips: therefore, God has blessed you forever.
19:45:3/Strap your sword at your side, O mighty one, adorned in your glory and majesty.
19:45:4/In your majesty, ride victoriously for the cause of truth, humility, and justice; let your right hand show you awe-inspiring deeds.
19:45:5/Your arrows are sharp, piercing the hearts of the king's enemies; the nations fall beneath your feet.
19:45:6/Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever; the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
19:45:7/You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore, God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.
19:45:8/Your robes are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia; from the ivory palaces, music has made you glad.
19:45:9/Daughters of kings are among your honored women; at your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.
19:45:10/Listen, O daughter, consider and give ear; forget your people and your father's house.
19:45:11/Then the king will be captivated by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.
19:45:12/The city of Tyre will come with a gift; the wealthiest of people will seek your favor.
19:45:13/The princess within the palace is glorious; her gown is interwoven with gold.
19:45:14/In embroidered garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow her—those brought to be with you.
19:45:15/They are led in with joy and gladness; they enter the palace of the king.
19:45:16/Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.
19:45:17/I will ensure your name is remembered in all generations; therefore, the nations will praise you forever and ever.
19:46:1/God is our safe place and source of strength, always there to help in times of trouble.
19:46:2/So we won't be afraid, even if the earth shifts, and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea;
19:46:3/Even if its waters roar and foam, and the mountains tremble with its tumult. Selah.
19:46:4/There's a river whose streams bring joy to the city of God, the sacred home of the Most High.
19:46:5/God is right there in the city; it won't be shaken: God will assist it at the break of day.
19:46:6/The nations were in uproar, kingdoms fell; he raised his voice, the earth melted away.
19:46:7/The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah.
19:46:8/Come, see what the LORD has done, the astonishing acts of desolation he has brought on the earth.
19:46:9/He puts an end to wars all over the planet; he breaks the bow, snaps the spear, and sets the chariots ablaze.
19:46:10/Stop, and realize that I am God: I will be honored among the nations, I will be honored throughout the earth.
19:46:11/The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah.
19:47:1/Applaud with your hands, everyone; shout to God with joyful voices.
19:47:2/For the LORD most high is awe-inspiring; he is a supreme King over the entire earth.
19:47:3/He will bring peoples under our control, and nations under our authority.
19:47:4/He will select our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he adores. Pause and reflect.
19:47:5/God has ascended amid loud cheers, the LORD with the blast of the trumpet.
19:47:6/Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.
19:47:7/For God is the ruler of the whole earth; sing insightful praises.
19:47:8/God rules over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.
19:47:9/The leaders of the peoples come together, as the people of the God of Abraham: for the protectors of the earth are God's; he is highly lifted up.
19:48:1/The LORD is great and deserves immense praise in the city of our God, on His holy mountain.
19:48:2/Mount Zion, stunning in its setting, the joy of the whole earth, is located in the far north, the city of the great King.
19:48:3/God is recognized in her palaces as a place of refuge.
19:48:4/Indeed, kings gathered together, they passed by as one.
19:48:5/When they saw it, they were amazed; they were distressed and hurried away.
19:48:6/Fear gripped them there, and agony, like that of a woman in labor.
19:48:7/You shattered the ships of Tarshish with a strong east wind.
19:48:8/Just as we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will secure it forever. Selah.
19:48:9/We reflect on your steadfast love, O God, within your temple.
19:48:10/Just as your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.
19:48:11/Let Mount Zion be joyful, let the daughters of Judah be happy, because of your judgments.
19:48:12/Explore Zion, walk around her; count her towers.
19:48:13/Pay close attention to her ramparts, examine her palaces; so you can tell the next generation.
19:48:14/For this God is our God forever and ever; He will lead us even beyond death.
19:49:1/Listen up, everyone; pay attention, all you people of the world:
19:49:2/No matter if you're low or high, rich or poor, we're all in this together.
19:49:3/I'm going to speak wisdom; and the thoughts of my heart will be filled with insight.
19:49:4/I'll pay attention to a story: I'll explain my complex ideas with the music of the harp.
19:49:5/Why should I be afraid in bad times, when the wrongs I've done seem to surround me?
19:49:6/Those who rely on their wealth, and brag about how much they have;
19:49:7/None of them can actually save another person, or offer God a payment for them:
19:49:8/(Because saving a soul is priceless, and that opportunity is gone forever:)
19:49:9/So that they could live forever, without experiencing decay.
19:49:10/It's clear that wise people die just like fools and senseless people do, leaving their wealth to others.
19:49:11/They think their houses will last forever, and their homes for generations; they even name lands after themselves.
19:49:12/But even people of honor don't last; they're no different from animals that die.
19:49:13/This way of thinking is their folly: yet their descendants follow their example. Pause and think about that.
19:49:14/They're like sheep heading to the grave; death will devour them; but the righteous will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, far from their luxurious homes.
19:49:15/But God will save my soul from the power of the grave: for he will take me to himself. Pause and think about that.
19:49:16/Don't be afraid when someone becomes rich, when the splendor of their house increases;
19:49:17/Because when they die they won't take anything with them: their splendor won't follow them.
19:49:18/Even though in life they praised themselves: and people will praise you when you look after your own interests.
19:49:19/They'll join their ancestors in death; they will never see the light again.
19:49:20/A person of honor who lacks understanding is just like the animals that perish.
19:50:1/The mighty God, the LORD, has spoken, calling the earth from sunrise to sunset.
19:50:2/From Zion, the epitome of beauty, God has shone forth.
19:50:3/Our God will come and will not remain silent: a consuming fire will precede him, and a fierce storm will surround him.
19:50:4/He will summon the heavens above and the earth below to judge his people.
19:50:5/Bring my faithful ones together to me; those who have committed to me through sacrifice.
19:50:6/And the skies will proclaim his justice: for God himself is the judge. Pause and reflect.
19:50:7/Listen, my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you: I am God, your God.
19:50:8/I will not criticize you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are always before me.
19:50:9/I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your pens.
19:50:10/For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand hills.
19:50:11/I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine.
19:50:12/If I were hungry, I wouldn't tell you, for the world is mine, and everything in it.
19:50:13/Do you think I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
19:50:14/Offer to God your gratitude; and fulfill your promises to the Most High.
19:50:15/And call on me in times of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor me.
19:50:16/But to the wicked, God says, "What right do you have to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?
19:50:17/Considering you despise my instructions and toss my words aside.
19:50:18/When you see a thief, you join him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.
19:50:19/You use your mouth for evil and your tongue weaves lies.
19:50:20/You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.
19:50:21/You did these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But I will rebuke you and lay the charges before you.
19:50:22/Now consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, with no one to rescue you.
19:50:23/Whoever offers praise honors me; and to the one who sets their life on the right path, I will show the salvation of God.
19:51:1/Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving kindness: according to your great compassion, erase my wrongdoings.
19:51:2/Cleanse me thoroughly from my guilt, and purify me from my sin.
19:51:3/For I am fully aware of my wrongdoings: and my sin is constantly before me.
19:51:4/Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight: so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.
19:51:5/Indeed, I was born in guilt; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
19:51:6/Indeed, you desire truth in the inner being: and in the hidden part, you will teach me wisdom.
19:51:7/Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean: wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
19:51:8/Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
19:51:9/Hide your face from my sins, and erase all my wrongdoings.
19:51:10/Create in me a pure heart, O God; and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
19:51:11/Do not cast me away from your presence; and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
19:51:12/Restore to me the joy of your salvation; and sustain me with a willing spirit.
19:51:13/Then I will teach wrongdoers your ways; and sinners will turn back to you.
19:51:14/Rescue me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
19:51:15/O Lord, open my lips; and my mouth will declare your praise.
19:51:16/For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you are not pleased with burnt offering.
19:51:17/The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not scorn.
19:51:18/Do good in your good pleasure to Zion: rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
19:51:19/Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then bulls will be offered on your altar.
19:52:1/Why do you brag about your evil deeds, O powerful one? God's goodness lasts forever.
19:52:2/Your tongue plots harm; it's like a sharp razor, crafting lies.
19:52:3/You prefer evil over good, lying over speaking the truth. Selah.
19:52:4/You delight in destructive words, you deceitful tongue.
19:52:5/God will also destroy you completely, he will remove you, and uproot you from your home, and eliminate you from the land of the living. Selah.
19:52:6/The righteous will see, be afraid, and then laugh at you:
19:52:7/Look, this is the man who did not make God his stronghold; but relied on his great wealth, and fortified himself in his evil.
19:52:8/But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God: I trust in God's mercy forever and ever.
19:52:9/I will praise you forever, because you have acted: and I will wait on your name; for it is favorable in the eyes of your faithful.
19:53:1/The fool says in their heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt and commit terrible wrongs; no one does good.
19:53:2/God looks down from heaven on all humanity to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
19:53:3/Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
19:53:4/Do those who do evil never learn? They devour my people as though eating bread and never call on God.
19:53:5/There they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to fear. God has scattered the bones of those who attack you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
19:53:6/If only salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob be joyful, let Israel be glad.
19:54:1/Rescue me, O God, by your name, and vindicate me by your power.
19:54:2/Listen to my prayer, O God; pay attention to the words of my mouth.
19:54:3/For strangers have risen against me, and oppressors seek my life: they do not consider God in their actions. Selah.
19:54:4/See, God is my helper: the Lord supports those who sustain my life.
19:54:5/He will repay my enemies for their evil: eliminate them by your faithfulness.
19:54:6/I will offer sacrifices to you willingly: I will praise your name, O LORD, because it is gracious.
19:54:7/For he has rescued me from all troubles: and my eyes have witnessed his retribution on my foes.
19:55:1/Listen to my prayer, O God; do not ignore my plea.
19:55:2/Pay attention to me and answer me. I am overwhelmed by my troubles and I can't stop complaining.
19:55:3/Because of the enemy's voice, because of the oppression by the wicked. They pile sin upon me, and in anger they hate me.
19:55:4/My heart is deeply pained within me, and the fears of death have fallen upon me.
19:55:5/Fear and trembling have overtaken me, and horror has overwhelmed me.
19:55:6/And I said, "If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.
19:55:7/Indeed, I would wander far away, and stay in the wilderness. Selah.
19:55:8/I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and storm."
19:55:9/Destroy them, O Lord, and confuse their speech, for I see violence and conflict in the city.
19:55:10/Day and night they prowl around on its walls; evil and trouble are within it.
19:55:11/Wickedness is at its heart; deceit and dishonesty never leave its streets.
19:55:12/For it wasn't an enemy who insulted me—I could have tolerated that. It wasn't a foe who rose against me—for then I could have hidden from him.
19:55:13/But it was you, someone like me, my companion and close friend.
19:55:14/We shared sweet conversations together; we walked to the house of God with the crowd.
19:55:15/Let death take them by surprise; let them go down to the grave alive, for evil resides in their homes and among them.
19:55:16/As for me, I will call on God, and the Lord will save me.
19:55:17/Evening, morning, and noon, I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.
19:55:18/He has brought me peace from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
19:55:19/God will hear and humble them, even he who sits enthroned from ancient times. Selah. Because they do not change and do not fear God.
19:55:20/He has turned his hands against those who were at peace with him; he has violated his covenant.
19:55:21/His words were smoother than butter, but hostility was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
19:55:22/Cast your cares on the Lord, and he will support you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.
19:55:23/But you, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction; bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.
19:56:1/Have mercy on me, O God, because people are trying to consume me; they attack me every day and oppress me.
19:56:2/My enemies constantly try to devour me; there are so many fighting against me, O Most High.
19:56:3/Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.
19:56:4/In God, I will praise his word, in God I have placed my trust; I will not be afraid of what humans can do to me.
19:56:5/They twist my words every day; all their thoughts are aimed at harming me.
19:56:6/They come together, they hide, they watch my every move, waiting to take my life.
19:56:7/Will they get away with their wrongdoing? In your anger, bring down the nations, O God.
19:56:8/You keep track of all my wandering; you collect my tears in your bottle. Aren't they recorded in your book?
19:56:9/Whenever I call out to you, my enemies will turn back. I know this because God is on my side.
19:56:10/In God, I will praise his word; in the LORD, I will praise his word.
19:56:11/In God, I have placed my trust; I will not be afraid of what humans can do to me.
19:56:12/Your promises bind me, O God; I will offer you my praise.
19:56:13/For you have saved my life from death; won't you keep my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God in the light of life?
19:57:1/Show me kindness, O God, show me kindness: for my soul relies on you: indeed, under the protection of your wings will I find my shelter, until these disasters have passed.
19:57:2/I will call out to God most high; to God who accomplishes everything for me.
19:57:3/He will send help from heaven, and rescue me from the scorn of those who would devour me. Pause. God will dispatch his compassion and his truth.
19:57:4/My soul is surrounded by lions: and I dwell among those who are fiercely aggressive, even among humans, whose teeth are like spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
19:57:5/Lift yourself high above, O God, over the heavens; let your majesty be over the entire earth.
19:57:6/They have laid a trap for my steps; my soul is weighed down: they have dug a pit in my path, into which they themselves have fallen. Pause.
19:57:7/My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast: I will sing and offer praise.
19:57:8/Wake up, my soul; wake up, stringed instruments and harp: I will rise early myself.
19:57:9/I will praise you, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing to you among the nations.
19:57:10/For your kindness reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies.
19:57:11/Lift yourself high above, O God, over the heavens; let your majesty be over the entire earth.
19:58:1/Do you really speak truthfully, O community? Do you make fair judgments, O people?
19:58:2/Indeed, in your hearts you commit evil; you plan violence with your hands in the world.
19:58:3/The wicked are alienated from birth: they stray from the path as soon as they are born, telling lies.
19:58:4/Their venom is like that of a snake; they are like the deaf viper that plugs its ears;
19:58:5/Who refuses to listen to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillfully they charm.
19:58:6/Shatter their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smash the powerful teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
19:58:7/Let them dissolve like water that flows away; when he aims his arrows, let them be cut to pieces.
19:58:8/Like a snail that dissolves into slime, let each of them vanish; like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.
19:58:9/Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, he will sweep them away with a whirlwind, both the living and in his anger.
19:58:10/The righteous will celebrate when they see the retribution; they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.
19:58:11/So that people will say, "Indeed, there is a reward for the righteous; indeed, there is a God who judges on earth."
19:59:1/Rescue me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.
19:59:2/Save me from those who do evil, and rescue me from violent people.
19:59:3/For look, they lie in wait for my life; the powerful gather against me—not for any wrongdoing or sin of mine, O LORD.
19:59:4/They charge and prepare themselves without any guilt of mine: awaken to assist me, and take notice.
19:59:5/You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awaken to judge all the nations; show no mercy to any wicked traitors. Selah.
19:59:6/They come back at dusk, growling like dogs, and prowl around the city.
19:59:7/See, they spew insults from their mouths; sharp words are on their lips: for who, they think, can hear us?
19:59:8/But you, O LORD, will laugh at them; you will mock all the nations.
19:59:9/Because of your strength, I will wait for you; for God is my fortress.
19:59:10/The God who shows me unfailing love will come before me; God will let me look in triumph on my foes.
19:59:11/Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by your power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
19:59:12/For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter.
19:59:13/Destroy them in your anger, wipe them out completely, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.
19:59:14/Let them return at evening, growling like dogs, and prowling around the city.
19:59:15/Let them roam around for food, and howl if they are not satisfied.
19:59:16/But I will sing of your strength; in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
19:59:17/To you, O my Strength, I will sing praises; for God is my fortress, the God who shows me unfailing love.
19:60:1/O God, you have rejected us, scattered us, and shown your displeasure; please turn back to us.
19:60:2/You have caused the earth to quake; you have torn it open: repair its fractures, for it trembles.
19:60:3/You have made your people experience difficult times; you have given us the wine of bewilderment.
19:60:4/You have provided a flag for those who fear you, so it may be raised in the name of truth. Selah.
19:60:5/So that your loved ones may be rescued; save us with your mighty hand, and listen to me.
19:60:6/God has spoken in his sanctuary; I will celebrate, I will divide Shechem, and distribute the valley of Succoth.
19:60:7/Gilead belongs to me, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the fortress of my head; Judah is my commander.
19:60:8/Moab is my washbasin; over Edom, I will throw my shoe: Philistia, shout in triumph because of me.
19:60:9/Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will guide me into Edom?
19:60:10/Isn't it you, O God, who had rejected us? And you, O God, who did not march with our armies?
19:60:11/Provide us help against the adversary, for human help is worthless.
19:60:12/Through God, we will perform bravely: for it is he who will trample down our foes.
19:61:1/Listen to my cry, O God; pay attention to my prayer.
19:61:2/From the ends of the earth, I will call out to you when my heart is heavy: guide me to the rock that stands above me.
19:61:3/For you have been a refuge for me, and a strong tower against my foes.
19:61:4/I will dwell in your sanctuary forever: I will find safety under the shadow of your wings. Selah.
19:61:5/For you, O God, have listened to my commitments: you have granted me the legacy of those who revere your name.
19:61:6/You will extend the king's life: and his years for many generations.
19:61:7/He will stand in God's presence forever: Oh, provide mercy and truth, which may protect him.
19:61:8/So I will sing praises to your name forever, that I may fulfill my promises every day.
19:62:1/My soul truly waits for God: my salvation comes from him.
19:62:2/He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my protection; I will not be shaken much.
19:62:3/How long will you plot harm against someone? You will all be defeated: like a leaning wall or a shaky fence.
19:62:4/Their only plan is to bring him down from his high position; they take pleasure in lies: they speak blessings with their mouth, but inside they curse. Selah.
19:62:5/My soul, wait only for God; my hope comes from him.
19:62:6/He alone is my rock and my salvation: he is my protection; I will not be shaken.
19:62:7/In God is my salvation and my honor: the rock of my strength, and my safe place, is in God.
19:62:8/Trust in him at all times; people, open your hearts to him: God is our shelter. Selah.
19:62:9/Indeed, people of low status are nothing, and people of high status are a lie: when weighed, they are all less substantial than nothing.
19:62:10/Do not rely on oppression, and do not pride yourself in stolen goods: if your wealth grows, do not set your heart on it.
19:62:11/God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: that power belongs to God.
19:62:12/And to you, O Lord, belongs kindness: for you repay everyone according to their deeds.
19:63:1/O God, you are my God; I will seek you earnestly. My soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
19:63:2/To witness your power and your glory, just as I have seen you in the sanctuary.
19:63:3/Because your loving kindness is better than life itself, my lips will praise you.
19:63:4/So I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in your name.
19:63:5/My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods; and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.
19:63:6/When I think of you on my bed, and meditate on you in the night watches.
19:63:7/Because you have been my help, under the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.
19:63:8/My soul clings to you; your right hand supports me.
19:63:9/But those who seek to destroy my life will go down into the depths of the earth.
19:63:10/They will be given over to the sword and become food for foxes.
19:63:11/But the king will rejoice in God; everyone who swears by him will glory, but the mouths of liars will be silenced.
19:64:1/Listen to my voice, O God, in my prayer: protect my life from the fear of the enemy.
19:64:2/Conceal me from the secret plots of the wicked; from the rebellion of those who do evil:
19:64:3/Who sharpen their tongues like swords, and aim their words like arrows, even bitter words:
19:64:4/So they can shoot in secret at the blameless: suddenly they attack him, without fear.
19:64:5/They boost each other in their evil plans: they talk about setting traps in secret; they say, Who will see us?
19:64:6/They investigate sins; they conduct a thorough search: the thoughts and the hearts of each of them are deep.
19:64:7/But God will shoot them with an arrow; suddenly they will be wounded.
19:64:8/Thus, their own tongues will turn against them: everyone who sees them will run away.
19:64:9/And everyone will fear, and will proclaim the work of God; for they will thoughtfully consider what he has done.
19:64:10/The righteous will rejoice in the LORD, and will trust in him; and all the honest in heart will take pride.
19:65:1/Praise is waiting for you, O God, in Zion: and the vow will be fulfilled to you.
19:65:2/You who listen to prayer, all people will come to you.
19:65:3/Sins overwhelm me: but you will cleanse us from our wrongdoings.
19:65:4/Blessed is the person whom you choose and bring near to live in your courts: we will be filled with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
19:65:5/With awe-inspiring acts of righteousness, you will answer us, O God of our salvation; you are the hope of all the ends of the earth and of those far across the sea:
19:65:6/Who by his strength sets the mountains in place; being clothed with power:
19:65:7/Who calms the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
19:65:8/Even those at the farthest bounds are in awe of your signs; you make the dawn and the dusk sing for joy.
19:65:9/You visit the earth and water it, enriching it greatly with the river of God, full of water; you provide their grain, for so you have prepared it.
19:65:10/You soak its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its growth.
19:65:11/You crown the year with your bounty; your carts overflow with abundance.
19:65:12/They pour out on the desert pastures; the hills wrap themselves with joy.
19:65:13/The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
19:66:1/Make a joyful noise to God, all you lands:
19:66:2/Sing out the honor of his name: make his praise magnificent.
19:66:3/Tell God, How awesome are your deeds! Through the power of your might, your enemies cringe before you.
19:66:4/All the earth shall worship you, and shall sing to you; they shall sing praises to your name. Selah.
19:66:5/Come and see the works of God: he is awesome in his actions toward humanity.
19:66:6/He turned the sea into dry land: they walked through the river on foot: there we celebrated him.
19:66:7/He rules with his power forever; his eyes watch the nations: let the rebellious not rise up. Selah.
19:66:8/O bless our God, you people, and let the sound of his praise be heard:
19:66:9/Who keeps our soul alive, and does not allow our feet to slip.
19:66:10/For you, O God, have tested us: you have refined us as silver is refined.
19:66:11/You brought us into the net; you placed heavy burdens on our backs.
19:66:12/You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water: but you brought us out to a place of abundance.
19:66:13/I will enter your house with burnt offerings: I will fulfill my vows to you,
19:66:14/Which my lips have spoken, and my mouth declared, when I was in distress.
19:66:15/I will offer to you burnt sacrifices of fattened animals, with the aroma of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.
19:66:16/Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for my soul.
19:66:17/I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue.
19:66:18/If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;
19:66:19/But truly God has listened; he has paid attention to the voice of my prayer.
19:66:20/Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, nor withheld his mercy from me.
19:67:1/May God be merciful to us, bless us, and make his face shine upon us. Selah.
19:67:2/So that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations.
19:67:3/Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you.
19:67:4/May the nations be joyful and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with fairness and guide the nations on earth. Selah.
19:67:5/Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you.
19:67:6/Then the earth will yield its harvest, and God, our own God, will bless us.
19:67:7/God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will revere him.
19:68:1/May God rise up, may his enemies be scattered; may those who hate him run away from him.
19:68:2/Just as smoke is blown away, so blow them away; as wax melts before the fire, so may the wicked vanish at God's presence.
19:68:3/But let the righteous be joyful; let them be delighted before God; yes, let them celebrate with great joy.
19:68:4/Sing to God, sing praises to his name; praise him who rides through the skies, known as JAH, and be joyful in his presence.
19:68:5/God is a father to the fatherless and a defender of widows in his holy dwelling.
19:68:6/God places the lonely in families; he frees those imprisoned with chains; but the rebellious live in a parched land.
19:68:7/O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert; Selah:
19:68:8/The earth trembled, the skies poured down rain at God's presence; even Mount Sinai shook before God, the God of Israel.
19:68:9/You, O God, sent abundant rain, refreshing your weary inheritance.
19:68:10/Your people settled in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.
19:68:11/The Lord announced the word; a great crowd spread the news.
19:68:12/Kings and their armies fled in haste; those who stayed at home divided the plunder.
19:68:13/Even though you lay among the campfires, you will shine like the wings of a dove covered with silver, and its feathers with shimmering gold.
19:68:14/When the Almighty scattered kings there, it was like snow falling on Mount Zalmon.
19:68:15/The mountain of God is like the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of many peaks like the mountain of Bashan.
19:68:16/Why do you look with envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the LORD himself will dwell forever?
19:68:17/The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
19:68:18/You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God might dwell there.
19:68:19/Praise be to the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, the God who is our salvation. Selah.
19:68:20/Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death.
19:68:21/But God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who go on in their sins.
19:68:22/The Lord says, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
19:68:23/That your feet may wade in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share."
19:68:24/They have seen your processions, O God, the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
19:68:25/The singers lead the way, followed by musicians; among them are young women playing tambourines.
19:68:26/Praise God in the great congregation; praise the LORD in the assembly of Israel.
19:68:27/There is little Benjamin, leading them, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
19:68:28/Your God has decreed your strength; show your strength, O God, as you have done for us.
19:68:29/Because of your temple at Jerusalem, kings will bring gifts to you.
19:68:30/Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.
19:68:31/Princes will come from Egypt; Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.
19:68:32/Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord; Selah:
19:68:33/To him who rides across the ancient heavens, the heavens which were from long ago; he sends out his voice, a mighty voice.
19:68:34/Acknowledge the power of God: his majesty is over Israel, his power is in the skies.
19:68:35/O God, you are awe-inspiring from your sanctuaries; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God.
19:69:1/Save me, O God; for the waters have risen up to my soul.
19:69:2/I'm sinking in deep mud with no foothold; I've entered deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.
19:69:3/I'm exhausted from crying; my throat is parched: my eyes grow dim waiting for my God.
19:69:4/Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; those who seek to destroy me are powerful, even though I did nothing to them.
19:69:5/O God, you know my foolishness; my sins are not hidden from you.
19:69:6/Let not those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those who seek you be dishonored because of me, O God of Israel.
19:69:7/Because for your sake I have faced disgrace; shame has covered my face.
19:69:8/I have become a stranger to my brothers, an outsider to my own mother's children.
19:69:9/For zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
19:69:10/When I wept and fasted, it brought me scorn.
19:69:11/I made sackcloth my clothing, and I became a byword to them.
19:69:12/Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me, and drunkards make up songs about me.
19:69:13/But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD, at an acceptable time; O God, in your great mercy, answer me with your sure salvation.
19:69:14/Rescue me from the mud, don't let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, and from the deep waters.
19:69:15/Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up; do not let the pit close its mouth over me.
19:69:16/Hear me, O LORD, for your steadfast love is good; turn to me according to your abundant mercy.
19:69:17/Do not hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress; answer me quickly.
19:69:18/Come near and rescue my soul; redeem me because of my enemies.
19:69:19/You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; all my adversaries are before you.
19:69:20/Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I looked for sympathy, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.
19:69:21/They also gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
19:69:22/Let their own table before them become a snare; and when they are at peace, let it become a trap.
19:69:23/Let their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.
19:69:24/Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.
19:69:25/Let their camp be desolate; let no one dwell in their tents.
19:69:26/For they persecute those you have struck, and they recount the pain of those you have wounded.
19:69:27/Add guilt to their guilt; let them not enter into your righteousness.
19:69:28/Let them be wiped out of the book of life and not be recorded with the righteous.
19:69:29/But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high.
19:69:30/I will praise God's name with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
19:69:31/This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hooves.
19:69:32/The humble will see this and be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
19:69:33/For the LORD hears the needy and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.
19:69:34/Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moves in them.
19:69:35/For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; they shall live there and have it in possession.
19:69:36/The offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell there.
19:70:1/Hurry, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord, to help me.
19:70:2/May those who are trying to take my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who wish me harm be turned back and humiliated.
19:70:3/May those who mock me be turned away in disgrace.
19:70:4/May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, "God is great!"
19:70:5/But I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my rescuer; O Lord, do not delay.
19:71:1/In you, O LORD, I place my trust; let me never be embarrassed.
19:71:2/Rescue me by your righteousness, and help me escape; listen to me closely, and save me.
19:71:3/Be my strong refuge, to which I can always come; you have ordered my salvation, for you are my rock and fortress.
19:71:4/Save me, O my God, from the clutches of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
19:71:5/For you are my hope, O Lord GOD; you have been my confidence since my youth.
19:71:6/From birth, I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will always praise you.
19:71:7/I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong shelter.
19:71:8/May my mouth be full of your praise and your glory all day long.
19:71:9/Do not cast me aside in my old age; do not abandon me when my strength is gone.
19:71:10/For my enemies talk about me; those who watch for my life conspire together,
19:71:11/Saying, "God has abandoned him; pursue and seize him, for no one will rescue him."
19:71:12/O God, do not be distant from me; O my God, hurry to assist me.
19:71:13/Let those who are against me be disgraced and destroyed; let those who seek to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.
19:71:14/But I will always have hope and will praise you more and more.
19:71:15/My mouth will tell of your righteousness and your salvation all day long, though I cannot count them.
19:71:16/I will come with the might of the Lord GOD; I will mention your righteousness, yours alone.
19:71:17/O God, you have taught me since my youth, and I still proclaim your marvelous deeds.
19:71:18/Even now, when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, until I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.
19:71:19/Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; you who have done great things, O God, who is like you?
19:71:20/You, who have made me see many troubles and calamities, will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
19:71:21/You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.
19:71:22/I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
19:71:23/My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed.
19:71:24/My tongue will talk of your righteousness all day long, for those who sought to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.
19:72:1/Grant the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the king's son.
19:72:2/He will rule your people fairly, and treat the poor with justice.
19:72:3/The mountains will bring peace to the people, and the hills will do so through fairness.
19:72:4/He will defend the poor among the people, save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.
19:72:5/People will respect you as long as the sun and moon exist, through all generations.
19:72:6/He will descend like rain on cut grass, like showers that soak the earth.
19:72:7/During his reign, the righteous will thrive; and there will be an abundance of peace until the moon is no more.
19:72:8/He will rule from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
19:72:9/Those who live in the wilderness will kneel before him; and his foes will bite the dust.
19:72:10/The kings of Tarshish and the islands will bring tribute; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present gifts.
19:72:11/Indeed, all kings will bow down to him; all nations will serve him.
19:72:12/For he will rescue the needy who cry out, the poor, and anyone who has no one to help them.
19:72:13/He will have compassion on the poor and needy, and save the lives of the needy.
19:72:14/He will free their lives from deceit and violence, and their blood will be precious in his sight.
19:72:15/And he will live, and the gold of Sheba will be given to him; people will always pray for him and bless him all day long.
19:72:16/A handful of grain will flourish in the land, even on the mountain tops; its fruit will rustle like Lebanon, and the people in the cities will thrive like grass on the earth.
19:72:17/His name will last forever; his name will endure as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.
19:72:18/Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
19:72:19/And blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.
19:72:20/The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are concluded.
19:73:1/God is truly good to Israel, especially to those with a pure heart.
19:73:2/But as for me, I almost lost my footing; my steps nearly slipped.
19:73:3/I felt envious of the foolish when I saw the success of the wicked.
19:73:4/They don't suffer in their death; their strength remains strong.
19:73:5/They don't face troubles like others; they aren't afflicted like everyone else.
19:73:6/So pride surrounds them like a chain; violence covers them like clothing.
19:73:7/Their eyes bulge with fatness; they have more than they could ever want.
19:73:8/They are corrupt and speak maliciously about oppression; they speak arrogantly.
19:73:9/They blaspheme against heaven, and their tongues strut across the earth.
19:73:10/So God's people turn to them, and they drink their fill of the cup of abundance.
19:73:11/And they say, "How does God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"
19:73:12/Look, these are the wicked, always at ease, increasing in wealth.
19:73:13/Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence.
19:73:14/For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.
19:73:15/If I had said, "I will speak like them," I would have betrayed your children.
19:73:16/When I tried to understand this, it was oppressive to me,
19:73:17/Until I entered God's sanctuary; then I understood their final destiny.
19:73:18/Indeed, you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.
19:73:19/How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!
19:73:20/Like a dream when one awakens, Lord, when you arise, you will despise their fantasies.
19:73:21/My heart was grieved, and I felt a sharp pain within me.
19:73:22/I was senseless and ignorant; I was like a brute beast before you.
19:73:23/Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
19:73:24/You guide me with your counsel, and later you will take me into glory.
19:73:25/Whom do I have in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
19:73:26/My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19:73:27/Indeed, those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
19:73:28/But for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge, so I can tell of all your deeds.
19:74:1/O God, why have you abandoned us forever? Why is your anger so intense against the sheep of your own pasture?
19:74:2/Remember your community, which you have owned since ancient times; the tribe you have redeemed as your inheritance, this Mount Zion where you have lived.
19:74:3/Step into the endless ruins; see all the destruction the enemy has caused in the sanctuary.
19:74:4/Your enemies shout in the middle of your gatherings; they set up their banners as symbols of victory.
19:74:5/A person was once renowned for how he could chop down the dense forests.
19:74:6/But now they tear down its beautifully carved work all at once with axes and hammers.
19:74:7/They have thrown fire into your sanctuary, they have desecrated it by reducing the place where your name resides to rubble.
19:74:8/They thought to themselves, "Let's completely destroy them." They have burned every place of worship in the land.
19:74:9/We no longer see our symbols; there are no prophets left, and none of us knows how long this will last.
19:74:10/O God, how long will the adversary mock? Will the enemy disrespect your name forever?
19:74:11/Why do you hold back your hand, your powerful right hand? Take it out and use it!
19:74:12/For God is my King from long ago, bringing salvation on the earth.
19:74:13/You split the sea by your power; you shattered the heads of sea monsters in the waters.
19:74:14/You crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.
19:74:15/You opened up springs and streams; you dried up ever-flowing rivers.
19:74:16/The day is yours, and so is the night; you established the moon and the sun.
19:74:17/You set all the boundaries of the earth; you created summer and winter.
19:74:18/Remember how the enemy has mocked you, LORD, and how foolish people have disrespected your name.
19:74:19/Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
19:74:20/Pay attention to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are filled with the haunts of violence.
19:74:21/Do not let the downtrodden be turned away in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.
19:74:22/Stand up, O God, defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.
19:74:23/Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises constantly.
19:75:1/To you, O God, we give thanks, to you we give thanks: for your name is close and your amazing deeds proclaim it.
19:75:2/When I gather the assembly, I will judge with fairness.
19:75:3/The earth and all who live in it may crumble; I hold up its foundations. Selah.
19:75:4/I told the foolish, "Do not act recklessly," and to the wicked, "Do not raise your power:"
19:75:5/Do not raise your power proudly; do not speak with arrogance.
19:75:6/For advancement doesn't come from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert.
19:75:7/But God is the judge: He demotes one, and promotes another.
19:75:8/For in the LORD's hand there is a cup, with foaming wine, well mixed; and he pours from it, but its dregs, all the wicked of the earth shall drain and drink.
19:75:9/But I will declare forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19:75:10/I will cut off all the power of the wicked, but the power of the righteous shall be lifted high.
19:76:1/In Judah, God is known; his name is celebrated in Israel.
19:76:2/In Salem too, his tent is set up, and he lives in Zion.
19:76:3/There, he shattered the arrows, shields, swords, and the tools of war. Selah.
19:76:4/You are more majestic and splendid than the mountains of prey.
19:76:5/The brave have been plundered, they have fallen into their final sleep; and the warriors could not use their strength.
19:76:6/At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariots and horses are plunged into a deep sleep.
19:76:7/You, and only you, are to be revered; who can stand before you when you're angry?
19:76:8/You made your judgment known from heaven; the earth was afraid and fell silent,
19:76:9/When God stood up to judge, to rescue all the humble of the earth. Selah.
19:76:10/Indeed, human anger will end up praising you; you will hold back the remainder of wrath.
19:76:11/Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let everyone around him bring gifts to the one who should be revered.
19:76:12/He will diminish the spirit of princes; he is fearsome to the kings of the earth.
19:77:1/I called out to God loudly, to God with my voice; and he listened to me.
19:77:2/When I was in distress, I sought the Lord: my wound kept bleeding through the night, without stopping; my soul refused to be consoled.
19:77:3/I thought of God and felt disturbed: I complained, and my spirit felt crushed. Selah.
19:77:4/You keep me awake; I am so troubled that I'm speechless.
19:77:5/I've thought about the days gone by, the years of long ago.
19:77:6/I remember my nighttime song; I talk with my heart: and my spirit searches deeply.
19:77:7/Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he never show his favor again?
19:77:8/Has his steadfast love vanished forever? Does his promise no longer stand?
19:77:9/Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion? Selah.
19:77:10/And I said, "This is my weakness: but I will remember the years of the mighty right hand of the Most High."
19:77:11/I will recall the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your ancient wonders.
19:77:12/I will also reflect on all your work, and ponder your deeds.
19:77:13/Your way, O God, is holy: What god is as great as our God?
19:77:14/You are the God who performs miracles; you have made your power known among the peoples.
19:77:15/With your arm, you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
19:77:16/The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.
19:77:17/The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.
19:77:18/The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.
19:77:19/Your way is through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints are unseen.
19:77:20/You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19:78:1/Listen, my people, to my teaching; pay attention to the words I speak.
19:78:2/I will speak in parables; I will tell mysteries from long ago.
19:78:3/These are things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us.
19:78:4/We won't keep them from their descendants; we'll tell the next generation about the Lord's praiseworthy acts, his power, and the wonderful things he has done.
19:78:5/He set up a witness in Jacob and established a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children,
19:78:6/So the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.
19:78:7/Then they would put their trust in God and not forget his deeds but keep his commands.
19:78:8/They would not be like their ancestors—a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.
19:78:9/The warriors of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle.
19:78:10/They did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.
19:78:11/They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.
19:78:12/He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
19:78:13/He split the sea and led them through; he made the water stand up like a wall.
19:78:14/He guided them with a cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.
19:78:15/He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas.
19:78:16/He brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.
19:78:17/Yet they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.
19:78:18/They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved.
19:78:19/They spoke against God; they said, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?"
19:78:20/True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread? Can he supply meat for his people?"
19:78:21/When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
19:78:22/Because they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
19:78:23/Yet he had commanded the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;
19:78:24/He rained down manna for them to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
19:78:25/Humans ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.
19:78:26/He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow.
19:78:27/He rained meat down on them like dust, birds like sand on the seashore.
19:78:28/He made them fall inside their camp, all around their tents.
19:78:29/They ate till they were gorged—he had given them what they craved.
19:78:30/But before they turned from what they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths,
19:78:31/God's anger rose against them; he killed the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.
19:78:32/In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite his wonders, they did not believe.
19:78:33/So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.
19:78:34/Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned back to him.
19:78:35/They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.
19:78:36/But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;
19:78:37/Their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
19:78:38/Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.
19:78:39/He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
19:78:40/How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!
19:78:41/Again and again they tested God; they pushed the Holy One of Israel to the limit.
19:78:42/They did not remember his power—the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
19:78:43/How he displayed his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.
19:78:44/He turned their rivers into blood; they could not drink from their streams.
19:78:45/He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
19:78:46/He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
19:78:47/He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
19:78:48/He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
19:78:49/He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation, and hostility—a band of destroying angels.
19:78:50/He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave their lives over to the plague.
19:78:51/He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
19:78:52/But he brought his own people out like sheep and led them in the wilderness like a flock.
19:78:53/He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
19:78:54/Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.
19:78:55/He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.
19:78:56/But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.
19:78:57/Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.
19:78:58/They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
19:78:59/When God heard them, he was furious; he completely rejected Israel.
19:78:60/So he abandoned the dwelling at Shiloh, the tent he had set up among humans.
19:78:61/He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the enemy's hands.
19:78:62/He gave his people over to the sword; he was furious with his inheritance.
19:78:63/Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;
19:78:64/Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.
19:78:65/Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior refreshed with wine.
19:78:66/He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.
19:78:67/He rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
19:78:68/But he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.
19:78:69/He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.
19:78:70/He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;
19:78:71/From tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.
19:78:72/And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.
19:79:1/O God, foreign invaders have entered your land; they have desecrated your holy temple and turned Jerusalem into ruins.
19:79:2/They have left the bodies of your followers to be eaten by the birds of the sky, the flesh of your holy ones to the wild animals.
19:79:3/They have spilled their blood like water all around Jerusalem; and there was no one to bury them.
19:79:4/We have become an object of ridicule to our neighbors, mocked and laughed at by those around us.
19:79:5/How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?
19:79:6/Unleash your anger on the nations that don't acknowledge you, and on the kingdoms that don't call on your name.
19:79:7/For they have devoured Jacob and left his home in ruins.
19:79:8/Please don't hold our past sins against us. Let your compassion quickly meet us, for we are in desperate need.
19:79:9/Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of your name; rescue us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.
19:79:10/Why should the nations ask, "Where is their God?" Let it be known among the nations, in our sight, by avenging the blood of your servants that has been shed.
19:79:11/Let the groans of the prisoners reach you; by your great power, spare those doomed to die.
19:79:12/And repay our neighbors seven times over into their laps the insults they have hurled at you, Lord.
19:79:13/Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will thank you forever; from generation to generation, we will recount your praise.
19:80:1/Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who are enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth.
19:80:2/Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, awaken your might, and come to save us.
19:80:3/Restore us again, O God, and make your face shine upon us; then we will be saved.
19:80:4/O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with the prayers of your people?
19:80:5/You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears in abundance.
19:80:6/You have made us an object of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.
19:80:7/Restore us again, O God of hosts, make your face shine upon us, and we will be saved.
19:80:8/You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
19:80:9/You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.
19:80:10/The mountains were covered with its shadow, and its branches were like mighty cedars.
19:80:11/It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River.
19:80:12/Why have you then broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pluck its fruit?
19:80:13/The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed on it.
19:80:14/Come back, we beg you, O God of hosts; look down from heaven and see, and visit this vine,
19:80:15/The vineyard that your right hand has planted, and the branch that you made strong for yourself.
19:80:16/It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
19:80:17/Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, on the son of man you have raised up for yourself.
19:80:18/Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.
19:80:19/Restore us again, O LORD God of hosts; make your face shine upon us, and we will be saved.
19:81:1/Sing loudly to God, our strength; make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
19:81:2/Bring a psalm, and come with the timbrel, the lovely harp, and the psaltery.
19:81:3/Sound the trumpet at the new moon, at the set time, on our special feast day.
19:81:4/For this was a decree for Israel, and a rule from the God of Jacob.
19:81:5/He established this in Joseph as a witness, when he passed through the land of Egypt, where I heard a language I did not understand.
19:81:6/I lifted the burden from his shoulders; his hands were freed from carrying pots.
19:81:7/You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
19:81:8/Listen, my people, and I will speak to you; O Israel, if you would only listen to me!
19:81:9/You must have no foreign god among you; you shall not worship any foreign deity.
19:81:10/I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt: open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
19:81:11/But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel did not want me.
19:81:12/So I let them follow their own stubborn desires, living according to their own advice.
19:81:13/If only my people had listened to me, if Israel had followed my paths!
19:81:14/I would quickly have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their foes.
19:81:15/Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their fate would last forever.
19:81:16/I would have fed them also with the finest of wheat; and with honey from the rock I would have satisfied you.
19:82:1/God stands in the assembly of the powerful; he judges among the divine beings.
19:82:2/How long will you make unfair judgments and favor the wicked? Pause and think.
19:82:3/Stand up for the poor and the orphans; ensure justice for those who are suffering and in need.
19:82:4/Rescue the poor and the needy; save them from the grasp of evil people.
19:82:5/They are clueless and refuse to understand; they continue in their ignorance while the very foundations of the earth are shaken.
19:82:6/I have declared, 'You are divine beings; all of you are offspring of the Most High.'
19:82:7/Yet, you will die as mortals do, and fall just like any ruler.
19:82:8/Rise up, O God, and judge the earth: for all nations are your inheritance.
19:83:1/Do not remain silent, O God: do not hold your peace, and do not stand still, O God.
19:83:2/See, your enemies are causing chaos: and those who hate you have become bold.
19:83:3/They have devised sneaky plans against your people, and have plotted against those you protect.
19:83:4/They have said, "Come, let's erase them as a nation; so that the name of Israel will be forgotten."
19:83:5/For they have plotted together unanimously: they have formed an alliance against you:
19:83:6/The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
19:83:7/Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines along with the people of Tyre;
19:83:8/Assur has also joined them: they have helped the descendants of Lot. Pause and reflect.
19:83:9/Treat them like the Midianites; like Sisera, like Jabin, at the Kishon River:
19:83:10/Who were destroyed at Endor: they became like manure on the ground.
19:83:11/Make their leaders like Oreb, and like Zeeb: indeed, all their princes like Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
19:83:12/Who said, "Let's take the homes of God for ourselves."
19:83:13/O my God, make them like tumbleweeds; like chaff before the wind.
19:83:14/Like fire consumes a forest, and like flames set the mountains ablaze;
19:83:15/So chase them with your storm, and terrify them with your tempest.
19:83:16/Cover their faces with shame; so that they may seek your name, O LORD.
19:83:17/Let them be confused and troubled forever; yes, let them be put to shame, and vanish:
19:83:18/So that people may know that you, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, are the most high over all the earth.
19:84:1/How lovely are your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts!
19:84:2/My soul longs, yes, even faints for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
19:84:3/Indeed, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
19:84:4/Blessed are those who live in your house: they will always praise you. Selah.
19:84:5/Blessed is the person whose strength is in you; in whose heart are your paths.
19:84:6/Those passing through the valley of Baca turn it into a place of springs; the rain also covers it with pools.
19:84:7/They move from strength to strength, each one appears before God in Zion.
19:84:8/O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: listen, O God of Jacob. Selah.
19:84:9/Look, O God our shield, and gaze upon the face of your anointed.
19:84:10/For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
19:84:11/For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
19:84:12/O LORD of hosts, blessed is the person who trusts in you.
19:85:1/Lord, you have been kind to your land; you have restored the fortunes of Jacob.
19:85:2/You have forgiven the wrongdoing of your people; you have covered all their sins. Selah.
19:85:3/You have withdrawn all your anger; you have turned from your intense wrath.
19:85:4/Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put an end to your displeasure toward us.
19:85:5/Will you stay angry with us forever? Will you extend your anger through all generations?
19:85:6/Won't you bring us back to life again, so that your people can rejoice in you?
19:85:7/Show us your mercy, O LORD, and give us your salvation.
19:85:8/I will listen to what God the LORD says; for he will promise peace to his people and to his faithful ones. But let them not return to foolishness.
19:85:9/Indeed, his salvation is near those who fear him, so that glory may reside in our land.
19:85:10/Love and truth have met; justice and peace have embraced.
19:85:11/Truth will emerge from the earth; and justice will look down from heaven.
19:85:12/Yes, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.
19:85:13/Justice will pave the way for him; it will set us on the path of his steps.
19:86:1/Bend your ear down, O LORD, listen to me: for I am in need and lacking.
19:86:2/Keep my life safe; for I am devoted: O my God, rescue your servant who relies on you.
19:86:3/Show me kindness, O Lord: for I reach out to you every day.
19:86:4/Bring joy to the heart of your servant: for to you, O Lord, I offer my soul.
19:86:5/For you, Lord, are kind, always ready to forgive; and abundant in mercy to all who call on you.
19:86:6/Pay attention, O LORD, to my prayer; and listen to the sound of my pleas.
19:86:7/In my time of distress I will call on you: for you will respond to me.
19:86:8/Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord; nor are there any deeds like yours.
19:86:9/All nations you have created shall come and bow down before you, O Lord; and shall honor your name.
19:86:10/For you are magnificent, and perform marvelous deeds: you are God alone.
19:86:11/Teach me your ways, O LORD; I will follow your truth: make my heart single in honoring your name.
19:86:12/I will thank you, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will honor your name forever.
19:86:13/For your mercy towards me is vast: and you have saved my soul from the deepest darkness.
19:86:14/O God, the arrogant have risen against me, and gangs of violent men have targeted my life; they do not consider you.
19:86:15/But you, O Lord, are a God of compassion, generous, patient, and abundant in mercy and faithfulness.
19:86:16/Turn to me, and show me mercy; strengthen your servant, and save the child of your servant.
19:86:17/Show me a sign of your favor; so that those who hate me may see it and be embarrassed: because you, LORD, have helped and comforted me.
19:87:1/Its foundation is in the sacred mountains.
19:87:2/The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the homes of Jacob.
19:87:3/Magnificent things are said about you, O city of God. Pause and reflect.
19:87:4/I will mention Rahab and Babylon to those who acknowledge me: look, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this person was born there.
19:87:5/And about Zion, it will be said, "This person and that person were born in her; and the Most High himself will make her firm."
19:87:6/The LORD will count, when he records the people, that this person was born there. Pause and reflect.
19:87:7/Both the singers and the musicians will be there: all my sources of joy are in you.
19:88:1/O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried out day and night before you:
19:88:2/Let my prayer reach you; listen to my cry for help;
19:88:3/For my soul is overwhelmed with troubles, and my life is on the brink of the grave.
19:88:4/I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength:
19:88:5/Free among the dead, like those slain and lying in the grave, whom you no longer remember and who are cut off from your care.
19:88:6/You have put me in the deepest pit, in places of darkness, in the depths.
19:88:7/Your anger weighs heavily on me, and you have overwhelmed me with all your waves. Selah.
19:88:8/You have driven my friends away from me; you have made me repulsive to them: I am trapped and cannot escape.
19:88:9/My eyes are dim with grief. Lord, I call to you every day; I spread out my hands to you.
19:88:10/Will you perform wonders for the dead? Will the dead rise up and praise you? Selah.
19:88:11/Will your love be declared in the grave, your faithfulness in destruction?
19:88:12/Will your wonders be known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
19:88:13/But I cry to you for help, Lord; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
19:88:14/Lord, why do you reject me and hide your face from me?
19:88:15/I have been afflicted and close to death from my youth; I suffer your terrors and am in despair.
19:88:16/Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me.
19:88:17/All day long they surround me like water; they have engulfed me completely.
19:88:18/You have taken my loved ones and friends far from me; the darkness is my closest friend.
19:89:1/I will sing of the Lord's mercies forever: with my mouth, I will make your faithfulness known to every generation.
19:89:2/For I have declared, Mercy will be established forever: your faithfulness will be as firm as the heavens.
19:89:3/I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have made a promise to David, my servant,
19:89:4/I will make your descendants endure forever, and build up your throne for all generations. Selah.
19:89:5/And the heavens will praise your miracles, O Lord: your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.
19:89:6/For who in the skies can compare to the Lord? Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord?
19:89:7/God is greatly revered in the council of the holy ones, and awesome to all around him.
19:89:8/O Lord God of hosts, who is as mighty as you, O Lord? Your faithfulness surrounds you.
19:89:9/You control the raging of the sea: when its waves rise, you calm them.
19:89:10/You crushed Rahab like one who is slain; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
19:89:11/The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.
19:89:12/The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.
19:89:13/You have a powerful arm; strong is your hand, high is your right hand.
19:89:14/Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; mercy and truth go before you.
19:89:15/Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound: they walk, O Lord, in the light of your face.
19:89:16/In your name, they rejoice all day long; and in your righteousness, they are exalted.
19:89:17/For you are the splendor of their strength: and by your favor, our horn is lifted high.
19:89:18/For the Lord is our shield; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
19:89:19/Then you spoke in a vision to your faithful one, and said, I have given strength to one who is mighty; I have raised up one chosen from the people.
19:89:20/I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil, I have anointed him:
19:89:21/With whom my hand will be established; my arm also will strengthen him.
19:89:22/The enemy will not outwit him; nor the wicked one oppress him.
19:89:23/And I will crush his adversaries before him, and strike down those who hate him.
19:89:24/But my faithfulness and my mercy will be with him: and in my name, his horn will be lifted high.
19:89:25/I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand over the rivers.
19:89:26/He will call out to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.'
19:89:27/Also, I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
19:89:28/My mercy I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.
19:89:29/His descendants I will make endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
19:89:30/If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my judgments;
19:89:31/If they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments;
19:89:32/Then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes.
19:89:33/Yet, I will not withdraw my lovingkindness from him, nor will I betray my faithfulness.
19:89:34/I will not break my covenant, nor change what has gone out of my lips.
19:89:35/Once I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.
19:89:36/His descendants will endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.
19:89:37/It will be established forever like the moon, and like a faithful witness in the sky. Selah.
19:89:38/But you have rejected and spurned, you have been angry with your anointed.
19:89:39/You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.
19:89:40/You have broken down all his walls; you have brought his strongholds to ruin.
19:89:41/All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
19:89:42/You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
19:89:43/You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and have not supported him in battle.
19:89:44/You have made his splendor to cease, and cast his throne to the ground.
19:89:45/The days of his youth you have shortened; you have covered him with shame. Selah.
19:89:46/How long, Lord? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
19:89:47/Remember how fleeting my life is; for what futility you have created all humanity!
19:89:48/Who can live and not see death, or save themselves from the power of the grave? Selah.
19:89:49/Lord, where are your former acts of love, which you swore to David in your faithfulness?
19:89:50/Remember, Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,
19:89:51/With which your enemies mock, O Lord, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.
19:89:52/Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen, and Amen.
19:90:1/Lord, you have been our home through all the ages.
19:90:2/Before the mountains were born, or you brought the earth and the world into being, from forever to forever, you are God.
19:90:3/You turn people back to dust, saying, "Return to dust, you mortals."
19:90:4/For you, a thousand years are like yesterday when it's gone, like a watch in the night.
19:90:5/You sweep them away as if in a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is new in the morning.
19:90:6/In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered.
19:90:7/We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.
19:90:8/You have set our sins before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
19:90:9/All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.
19:90:10/The length of our days is seventy years—or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their span is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
19:90:11/Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.
19:90:12/Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
19:90:13/Relent, LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.
19:90:14/Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
19:90:15/Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.
19:90:16/Let your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.
19:90:17/Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands.
19:91:1/Whoever lives in the secret place of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
19:91:2/I will declare, "The LORD is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."
19:91:3/He will surely save you from the fowler's trap and from deadly disease.
19:91:4/He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings, you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your protective shield.
19:91:5/You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
19:91:6/Nor the disease that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday.
19:91:7/A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
19:91:8/You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
19:91:9/Because you have made the LORD, my refuge, the Most High, your dwelling place,
19:91:10/No harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your home.
19:91:11/For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways;
19:91:12/They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
19:91:13/You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.
19:91:14/"Because he loves me," says the LORD, "I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name."
19:91:15/He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.
19:91:16/With long life, I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.
19:92:1/It's a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises to your name, O Most High:
19:92:2/To display your love in the morning, and your faithfulness every night,
19:92:3/With a ten-stringed instrument, and with the psaltery; with the harp and a solemn sound.
19:92:4/For you, LORD, have made me joyful through your work: I will celebrate the works of your hands.
19:92:5/O LORD, how magnificent are your works! and your thoughts are incredibly profound.
19:92:6/A thoughtless person doesn't know; neither does a fool understand this.
19:92:7/When the wicked grow like the grass, and all the wrongdoers seem to thrive; it's so they will be destroyed forever:
19:92:8/But you, LORD, are the Most High forever.
19:92:9/For, look, your enemies, O LORD, for, look, your enemies will perish; all the wrongdoers will be scattered.
19:92:10/But you will lift my strength like the horn of a unicorn: I will be refreshed with new oil.
19:92:11/My eyes will also see my desires on my enemies, and my ears will hear my desires about the wicked who rise up against me.
19:92:12/The righteous will thrive like the palm tree: he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
19:92:13/Those who are planted in the house of the LORD will thrive in the courts of our God.
19:92:14/They will still bear fruit in old age; they will be vibrant and thriving;
19:92:15/To show that the LORD is just: he is my rock, and there is no wrongdoing in him.
19:93:1/The LORD reigns, adorned with majesty; the LORD is wrapped in strength, which he has secured around himself: the world too is established, so it cannot be shaken.
19:93:2/Your throne has been set up from the beginning; you are from all eternity.
19:93:3/The oceans have risen, O LORD, the oceans have raised their voice; the oceans lift up their pounding waves.
19:93:4/The LORD on high is more powerful than the roar of great waters, yes, more than the mighty breakers of the sea.
19:93:5/Your decrees are utterly reliable; holiness adorns your house, O LORD, forever.
19:94:1/O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself.
19:94:2/Rise up, you judge of the earth: give the proud what they deserve.
19:94:3/Lord, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked celebrate?
19:94:4/How long will they speak harshly and all the wrongdoers boast about themselves?
19:94:5/They crush your people, O Lord, and oppress your heritage.
19:94:6/They kill the widow and the foreigner, and murder the orphans.
19:94:7/Yet they say, "The Lord won't see, nor will the God of Jacob pay attention."
19:94:8/Understand, you senseless among the people: and you fools, when will you become wise?
19:94:9/He who planted the ear, won't he hear? He who formed the eye, won't he see?
19:94:10/He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish? He who teaches humans knowledge, doesn't he know?
19:94:11/The Lord knows the thoughts of humans, that they are futile.
19:94:12/Blessed is the person whom you discipline, O Lord, and teach from your law;
19:94:13/So that you may give them peace from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
19:94:14/For the Lord will not reject his people, nor will he abandon his inheritance.
19:94:15/But justice will return to righteousness: and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19:94:16/Who will stand up for me against the wrongdoers? Or who will take a stand for me against those who do evil?
19:94:17/If the Lord had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
19:94:18/When I thought, "My foot slips," your mercy, O Lord, held me up.
19:94:19/In the multitude of my anxious thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.
19:94:20/Can the throne of destruction be allied with you, which devises harm by decree?
19:94:21/They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
19:94:22/But the Lord is my fortress; my God is the rock of my refuge.
19:94:23/And he will repay them for their iniquity and destroy them in their own wickedness; yes, the Lord our God will destroy them.
19:95:1/Come, let's sing to the LORD: let's joyfully shout to the rock of our salvation.
19:95:2/Let's approach his presence with thanksgiving, and joyfully shout to him with songs.
19:95:3/For the LORD is an incredible God, and a supreme King above all gods.
19:95:4/He holds the depths of the earth in his hand: he also owns the strength of the mountains.
19:95:5/The sea belongs to him, for he created it: and his hands shaped the land.
19:95:6/Come, let's worship and bow down: let's kneel before the LORD, our creator.
19:95:7/For he is our God; we are the people he cares for, the sheep led by his hand. Today, if you listen to his voice,
19:95:8/Don't harden your hearts as you did during the rebellion, on that day of testing in the desert.
19:95:9/When your ancestors tested me, they tried me, even though they had seen what I can do.
19:95:10/For forty years, I was frustrated with that generation, and said, 'They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they do not know my ways.'
19:95:11/So I declared in my anger, 'They shall never enter my place of rest.'
19:96:1/Sing to the LORD a new song: sing to the LORD, all the earth.
19:96:2/Sing to the LORD, praise his name; spread the news of his salvation every day.
19:96:3/Tell of his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
19:96:4/For the LORD is great, and worthy of great praise: he is to be revered above all gods.
19:96:5/For all the gods of the nations are mere idols: but the LORD created the heavens.
19:96:6/Honor and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
19:96:7/Give to the LORD, O families of the peoples, give to the LORD glory and strength.
19:96:8/Give to the LORD the glory due to his name: bring an offering, and enter his courts.
19:96:9/Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness: tremble before him, all the earth.
19:96:10/Declare among the nations that the LORD reigns: the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved: he will judge the peoples with fairness.
19:96:11/Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice; let the sea and all that fills it resound.
19:96:12/Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy
19:96:13/Before the LORD, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth: he will judge the world with justice, and the peoples with his truth.
19:97:1/The LORD reigns; let the earth be joyful; let the multitude of islands be glad.
19:97:2/Clouds and darkness surround him: righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
19:97:3/A fire goes before him, and burns up his enemies on all sides.
19:97:4/His lightning lights up the world: the earth sees, and shakes.
19:97:5/The hills melt like wax in the presence of the LORD, in the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
19:97:6/The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
19:97:7/Let all who worship carved images be ashamed, those who boast in idols: worship him, all you gods.
19:97:8/Zion heard, and was joyful; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments, O LORD.
19:97:9/For you, LORD, are most high over all the earth: you are exalted far above all gods.
19:97:10/You who love the LORD, hate evil: he protects the lives of his faithful; he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.
19:97:11/Light is planted for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
19:97:12/Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; and give thanks at the memory of his holiness.
19:98:1/Sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done amazing things: his right hand, and his holy arm, have brought him victory.
19:98:2/The LORD has revealed his salvation; he has openly shown his righteousness in the presence of the nations.
19:98:3/He has remembered his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel: the whole world has witnessed the salvation of our God.
19:98:4/Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and be glad, and sing praises.
19:98:5/Sing to the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the sound of a song.
19:98:6/With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
19:98:7/Let the sea and everything in it roar; the world, and all who live in it.
19:98:8/Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains sing together for joy
19:98:9/Before the LORD; for he comes to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with fairness.
19:99:1/The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: He sits between the cherubim; let the earth shake.
19:99:2/The LORD is great in Zion; and He is exalted above all the people.
19:99:3/Let them praise Your great and awe-inspiring name; it is holy.
19:99:4/The King's power loves justice; You establish fairness, You administer justice and righteousness in Jacob.
19:99:5/Exalt the LORD our God, and bow down at His footstool; for He is holy.
19:99:6/Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who called on His name; they called on the LORD, and He answered them.
19:99:7/He spoke to them from the cloud; they kept His decrees, and the laws that He gave them.
19:99:8/You answered them, O LORD our God: You were a God who forgave them, even though You took vengeance on their misdeeds.
19:99:9/Exalt the LORD our God, and bow down at His holy mountain; for the LORD our God is holy.
19:100:1/Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth.
19:100:2/Serve the LORD with joy; come before him with singing.
19:100:3/Know that the LORD is God. He made us, and we belong to him; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
19:100:4/Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.
19:100:5/For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.
19:101:1/I will sing about love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing praises.
19:101:2/I will conduct myself with wisdom and integrity. Oh, when will you come to me? I will live with a pure heart within my home.
19:101:3/I will not set anything evil before my eyes; I despise the actions of those who stray; they will not influence me.
19:101:4/A perverse heart will be far from me; I will not associate with those who are evil.
19:101:5/Anyone who secretly slanders their neighbor, I will silence; those with arrogant attitudes and haughty hearts, I will not tolerate.
19:101:6/My focus will be on the loyal people of the land, so they may live with me; those who walk in the way of integrity will be in my service.
19:101:7/Anyone practicing deceit will not live in my house; those who lie will not stand in my presence.
19:101:8/I will promptly rid the land of all the wicked; so that I may eliminate all evildoers from the city of the LORD.
19:102:1/Listen to my prayer, O LORD, and hear my cry for help.
19:102:2/Do not hide from me in my time of trouble; listen to me closely: when I call, answer me quickly.
19:102:3/My days disappear like smoke, and my bones burn like glowing embers.
19:102:4/My heart is struck down and dried up like grass; I even forget to eat.
19:102:5/Because of my loud sighing, my bones stick to my skin.
19:102:6/I am like a pelican in the wilderness; I am like an owl in the wastelands.
19:102:7/I lie awake, isolated like a sparrow on the rooftop.
19:102:8/My enemies insult me all day long; those who rage against me use my name as a curse.
19:102:9/I eat ashes for bread and mix my drink with tears.
19:102:10/Because of your anger and wrath; for you have picked me up and thrown me aside.
19:102:11/My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
19:102:12/But you, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.
19:102:13/You will rise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show her favor; the appointed time has come.
19:102:14/Your servants care deeply for her stones and feel pity for her dust.
19:102:15/So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
19:102:16/When the LORD rebuilds Zion, he will appear in his glory.
19:102:17/He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.
19:102:18/This will be written for future generations, and a people not yet created will praise the LORD.
19:102:19/For he has looked down from his holy height; from heaven the LORD has viewed the earth,
19:102:20/To hear the groans of the prisoners, to release those condemned to die,
19:102:21/So that the name of the LORD may be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem,
19:102:22/When the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.
19:102:23/He has weakened my strength along the way; he has shortened my days.
19:102:24/I say, "My God, do not take me in the middle of my life, your years go on through all generations."
19:102:25/In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
19:102:26/They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded,
19:102:27/But you remain the same, and your years will never end.
19:102:28/The children of your servants will live on, and their descendants will be established before you.
19:103:1/Praise the LORD, my soul; with all my heart, praise his holy name.
19:103:2/Praise the LORD, my soul, and never forget all the good he has done:
19:103:3/He forgives all your sins and heals all your illnesses;
19:103:4/He rescues your life from the brink, crowns you with love and compassion;
19:103:5/He fills your life with good things, rejuvenating you like an eagle.
19:103:6/The LORD ensures justice and fairness for all who are wronged.
19:103:7/He revealed his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel.
19:103:8/The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.
19:103:9/He won't always accuse us, nor remain angry forever.
19:103:10/He hasn't treated us as our sins deserve, nor repaid us according to our wrongs.
19:103:11/Just as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his love for those who respect him.
19:103:12/As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our sins from us.
19:103:13/Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who respect him.
19:103:14/For he knows how we were made; he remembers that we are dust.
19:103:15/As for humans, their days are like grass; they flourish like a flower of the field;
19:103:16/But when the wind blows over it, it's gone, and its place remembers it no more.
19:103:17/But the LORD's love is everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;
19:103:18/To those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
19:103:19/The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.
19:103:20/Praise the LORD, you his angels, mighty in power, who obey his word.
19:103:21/Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.
19:103:22/Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the LORD, my soul.
19:104:1/Praise the LORD, my soul. O LORD my God, you are incredibly great; you are adorned with honor and majesty.
19:104:2/You wrap yourself in light as if it were a cloak; you stretch out the heavens like a tent:
19:104:3/You lay the beams of your upper chambers in the waters; you make the clouds your chariot; you ride on the wings of the wind:
19:104:4/You make your angels messengers; your servants flames of fire:
19:104:5/You set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.
19:104:6/You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
19:104:7/At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they rushed away.
19:104:8/They rose up to the mountains, ran down to the valleys to the place that you appointed for them.
19:104:9/You set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never again cover the earth.
19:104:10/You send springs into the valleys; they flow between the mountains.
19:104:11/They give water to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19:104:12/Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches.
19:104:13/You water the mountains from your upper chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.
19:104:14/You cause the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for people to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth:
19:104:15/And wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts.
19:104:16/The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he has planted;
19:104:17/Where the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the junipers.
19:104:18/The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.
19:104:19/He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to go down.
19:104:20/You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals prowl.
19:104:21/The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.
19:104:22/When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens.
19:104:23/People go out to their work, to their labor until evening.
19:104:24/O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
19:104:25/There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number—living things both large and small.
19:104:26/There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
19:104:27/All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
19:104:28/When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
19:104:29/When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
19:104:30/When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
19:104:31/The glory of the LORD will endure forever; the LORD will rejoice in his works.
19:104:32/He looks at the earth, and it trembles; he touches the mountains, and they smoke.
19:104:33/I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist.
19:104:34/My contemplation of him will be sweet; I will be glad in the LORD.
19:104:35/Let sinners vanish from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, my soul. Praise the LORD.
19:105:1/Give thanks to the LORD; call on his name: share his deeds with everyone.
19:105:2/Sing to him, sing hymns to him: talk about all his amazing works.
19:105:3/Take pride in his holy name: let the hearts of those who seek the LORD be joyful.
19:105:4/Search for the LORD and his strength: always seek his presence.
19:105:5/Remember the incredible works he has done; his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced;
19:105:6/You descendants of Abraham his servant, you offspring of Jacob, his chosen ones.
19:105:7/He is the LORD our God: his judgments are everywhere on earth.
19:105:8/He has always remembered his covenant, the promise he made for a thousand generations.
19:105:9/The covenant he made with Abraham, and his promise to Isaac;
19:105:10/And confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, and to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
19:105:11/Saying, "I will give you the land of Canaan as your inheritance."
19:105:12/When they were few in number, indeed very few, and strangers in it.
19:105:13/When they moved from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
19:105:14/He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:
19:105:15/Saying, "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
19:105:16/He also called for a famine on the land; he destroyed all the supplies of bread.
19:105:17/He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
19:105:18/They bruised his feet with shackles; his neck was put in iron,
19:105:19/Until what he foretold came to pass, until the word of the LORD proved him true.
19:105:20/The king sent and released him; the ruler of the people set him free.
19:105:21/He made him master of his household, and ruler over all his possessions,
19:105:22/To instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
19:105:23/Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
19:105:24/And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their foes.
19:105:25/He turned their hearts to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.
19:105:26/He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
19:105:27/They performed his signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.
19:105:28/He sent darkness and made it dark; they did not rebel against his words.
19:105:29/He turned their waters into blood, killing their fish.
19:105:30/Their land teemed with frogs, even in the royal chambers.
19:105:31/He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
19:105:32/He gave them hail instead of rain, and flaming fire in their land.
19:105:33/He struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
19:105:34/He spoke, and locusts came, young locusts without number,
19:105:35/And ate up all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the fruit of their soil.
19:105:36/He also struck down all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their strength.
19:105:37/He brought them out with silver and gold, and there was no one among their tribes who stumbled.
19:105:38/Egypt was happy when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
19:105:39/He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to light up the night.
19:105:40/They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
19:105:41/He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed in the desert like a river.
19:105:42/For he remembered his sacred promise to Abraham his servant.
19:105:43/And he led out his people with joy, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;
19:105:44/And gave them the lands of the nations, and they inherited what others had toiled for;
19:105:45/So that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD.
19:106:1/Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love lasts forever.
19:106:2/Who can fully speak of the LORD's mighty deeds? Who can show all his praise?
19:106:3/Blessed are those who uphold justice, and the one who does what is right at all times.
19:106:4/Remember me, LORD, with the favor you show to your people: come to me with your salvation;
19:106:5/So I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the joy of your nation, that I may boast with your inheritance.
19:106:6/We have sinned along with our ancestors, we have committed wrong, we have acted wickedly.
19:106:7/Our ancestors didn't understand your wonders in Egypt; they didn't remember your many acts of kindness but rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.
19:106:8/Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.
19:106:9/He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.
19:106:10/And he saved them from the hand of the foe, and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.
19:106:11/The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.
19:106:12/Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
19:106:13/But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
19:106:14/Instead, they craved intensely in the wilderness, and tested God in the desert.
19:106:15/And he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.
19:106:16/They were envious of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
19:106:17/The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, and covered the group of Abiram.
19:106:18/Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.
19:106:19/They made a calf at Horeb and worshiped a cast image.
19:106:20/Thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eats grass.
19:106:21/They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt;
19:106:22/Miraculous deeds in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.
19:106:23/So he said he would destroy them—had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.
19:106:24/Yet they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.
19:106:25/But grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the LORD's voice.
19:106:26/Therefore he raised his hand and swore to overthrow them in the wilderness,
19:106:27/To overthrow their descendants among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
19:106:28/They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;
19:106:29/They provoked him to anger with their practices, and a plague broke out among them.
19:106:30/Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stopped.
19:106:31/And that was credited to him as righteousness for all generations to come.
19:106:32/They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went badly for Moses because of them;
19:106:33/For they rebelled against his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
19:106:34/They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,
19:106:35/But mingled with the nations and adopted their practices.
19:106:36/They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
19:106:37/They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,
19:106:38/And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was desecrated by their blood.
19:106:39/They were defiled by their actions, and unfaithful in their deeds.
19:106:40/So the LORD's anger burned against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.
19:106:41/He handed them over to the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
19:106:42/Their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their power.
19:106:43/Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.
19:106:44/Yet he took note of their distress, when he heard their cry;
19:106:45/And he remembered his covenant for their sake, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
19:106:46/He also made them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.
19:106:47/Save us, LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
19:106:48/Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD.
19:107:1/Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good: his mercy lasts forever.
19:107:2/Let those the LORD has redeemed say so, those he has rescued from the clutches of the enemy;
19:107:3/And brought them back from different lands, from the east and west, from the north and south.
19:107:4/They wandered in the desert, a lonely path; they found no city to settle in.
19:107:5/Hungry and thirsty, they were at their breaking point.
19:107:6/Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19:107:7/And he guided them on the right path, so they could find a city to live in.
19:107:8/If only people would praise the LORD for his kindness, and for his amazing deeds for humanity!
19:107:9/For he satisfies the thirsty soul, and fills the hungry soul with good things.
19:107:10/Those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, shackled in misery and chains;
19:107:11/Because they defied the words of God, and disregarded the advice of the Most High:
19:107:12/So he humbled their hearts through hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
19:107:13/Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19:107:14/He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and shattered their chains.
19:107:15/If only people would praise the LORD for his kindness, and for his amazing deeds for humanity!
19:107:16/For he has shattered the gates of bronze, and cut through the bars of iron.
19:107:17/Fools, because of their sinful ways, and because of their wrongdoings, suffer affliction.
19:107:18/They loathe all kinds of food; and they come near to the gates of death.
19:107:19/Then they cry out to the LORD in their trouble, and he saves them from their distress.
19:107:20/He sends his word, and heals them, and rescues them from the grave.
19:107:21/If only people would praise the LORD for his kindness, and for his amazing deeds for humanity!
19:107:22/And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his works with joy.
19:107:23/Those who go down to the sea in ships, doing business on the vast waters;
19:107:24/They see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
19:107:25/For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves.
19:107:26/They rise up to the heavens, they go down to the depths; their courage melts away in their plight.
19:107:27/They reel and stagger like drunkards, and are at their wits' end.
19:107:28/Then they cry out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress.
19:107:29/He calms the storm to a whisper, so that the waves are still.
19:107:30/Then they are glad because the waters are calm; and he leads them to their desired haven.
19:107:31/If only people would praise the LORD for his kindness, and for his amazing deeds for humanity!
19:107:32/Let them exalt him also in the gathering of the people, and praise him in the meeting of the elders.
19:107:33/He turns rivers into a desert, and springs of water into thirsty ground;
19:107:34/A fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who live there.
19:107:35/He turns the desert into pools of water, and parched land into springs of water.
19:107:36/And there he lets the hungry live, so they may establish a city to dwell in;
19:107:37/And sow fields, and plant vineyards, which yield a fruitful harvest.
19:107:38/He blesses them so they multiply greatly; and he does not let their livestock diminish.
19:107:39/Yet again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
19:107:40/He pours contempt on princes, and makes them wander in trackless wastes.
19:107:41/But he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like flocks.
19:107:42/The upright see it and are glad; and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
19:107:43/Whoever is wise, let them heed these things and consider the steadfast love of the LORD.
19:108:1/Oh God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise, even with all my being.
19:108:2/Wake up, stringed instruments and harp: I will wake up the dawn.
19:108:3/I will praise you, O LORD, among the peoples: and I will sing praises to you among the nations.
19:108:4/For your mercy is greater than the heavens: and your truth extends to the clouds.
19:108:5/Be lifted up, O God, above the heavens: and let your glory be over all the earth;
19:108:6/So that your beloved may be rescued: save with your right hand, and answer me.
19:108:7/God has spoken in his sanctuary; I will celebrate, I will divide Shechem, and distribute the valley of Succoth.
19:108:8/Gilead belongs to me; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the stronghold of my head; Judah is my ruler;
19:108:9/Moab is my washbasin; over Edom, I will throw my shoe; over Philistia, I will shout in triumph.
19:108:10/Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will guide me into Edom?
19:108:11/Isn't it you, O God, who has rejected us? And won't you, O God, march out with our armies?
19:108:12/Provide us help against the adversary: for human help is worthless.
19:108:13/Through God, we will perform bravely: for it is he who will trample down our foes.
19:109:1/Do not stay silent, O God of my praise;
19:109:2/For the mouths of the wicked and deceitful are open against me: they have lied about me.
19:109:3/They have also surrounded me with words of hate; and attacked me without reason.
19:109:4/Even though I showed them love, they are my enemies: but I dedicate myself to prayer.
19:109:5/And they have repaid me with evil for good, and hatred for my love.
19:109:6/Appoint a wicked person over him: and let Satan stand at his right side.
19:109:7/When he is judged, let him be found guilty: and let his prayers be considered sinful.
19:109:8/May his life be short; and may someone else take his position.
19:109:9/May his children become orphans, and his wife a widow.
19:109:10/Let his children wander and beg; let them seek their food from desolate places.
19:109:11/May the extortioner seize all he has; and let strangers plunder his work.
19:109:12/Let no one show him kindness; nor anyone care for his fatherless children.
19:109:13/May his descendants be wiped out; and in the next generation, may their names be erased.
19:109:14/May the sins of his ancestors be remembered by the LORD; and may the sins of his mother not be erased.
19:109:15/Let them always be before the LORD, so he may erase their memory from the earth.
19:109:16/Because he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy, intending to kill those with broken hearts.
19:109:17/As he loved to curse, let curses come upon him; as he did not delight in blessing, may it be far from him.
19:109:18/As he wrapped himself in curses as his clothing, may they soak into his body like water, and into his bones like oil.
19:109:19/May it be like a cloak wrapped around him, and a belt tied forever around him.
19:109:20/Let this be the reward for my adversaries from the LORD, and for those who speak evil against me.
19:109:21/But you, O GOD the Lord, act on my behalf for your name's sake; because your mercy is good, rescue me.
19:109:22/For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
19:109:23/I fade away like a shadow at dusk; I am shaken off like a locust.
19:109:24/My knees are weak from fasting; and my body lacks fat.
19:109:25/I have become a disgrace to them; when they see me, they shake their heads.
19:109:26/Help me, O LORD my God; save me according to your mercy.
19:109:27/So they may know that this is your doing; that you, LORD, have done it.
19:109:28/Let them curse, but you bless; when they attack, let them be disgraced; but let your servant rejoice.
19:109:29/May my accusers be clothed with dishonor, and wrap themselves in their shame as in a cloak.
19:109:30/I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; indeed, I will praise him among the masses.
19:109:31/For he stands at the right side of the needy, to save them from those who would condemn them.
19:110:1/The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."
19:110:2/The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion: rule in the midst of your enemies.
19:110:3/Your people will volunteer freely on the day of your power, in holy splendor from the dawn of the morning; you have the vigor of youth.
19:110:4/The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
19:110:5/The Lord at your right hand will shatter kings on the day of His anger.
19:110:6/He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter leaders over wide areas.
19:110:7/He will drink from the stream along the way; therefore, he will lift up his head.
19:111:1/Celebrate the LORD. I will praise the LORD with all my heart, in the gathering of the righteous, and in the community.
19:111:2/The works of the LORD are magnificent, sought after by all who delight in them.
19:111:3/His work is noble and splendid: and his righteousness lasts forever.
19:111:4/He has made his marvelous deeds memorable: the LORD is kind and full of mercy.
19:111:5/He has provided food for those who respect him: he will always remember his agreement.
19:111:6/He has shown his people the strength of his actions, so that he can give them the lands of other nations.
19:111:7/The deeds of his hands are truth and justice; all his guidelines are reliable.
19:111:8/They remain firm forever and ever, executed with faithfulness and integrity.
19:111:9/He delivered freedom to his people: he has decreed his covenant forever: holy and awe-inspiring is his name.
19:111:10/Respecting the LORD is the start of wisdom: all who follow his commands have a good understanding: his praise lasts forever.
19:112:1/Praise the LORD. Blessed is the person who respects the LORD, who finds great joy in his commands.
19:112:2/Their descendants will be powerful in the land; the family of the upright will be blessed.
19:112:3/Wealth and riches will be in their home; and their righteousness lasts forever.
19:112:4/For the upright, light shines in the darkness: they are generous, compassionate, and just.
19:112:5/A good person shows kindness and lends; they manage their affairs wisely.
19:112:6/They will never be shaken; the righteous will be remembered forever.
19:112:7/They will not fear bad news; their heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.
19:112:8/Their heart is secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.
19:112:9/They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.
19:112:10/The wicked will see it and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longing of the wicked will come to nothing.
19:113:1/Praise the LORD. Praise, all you servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
19:113:2/May the name of the LORD be blessed from now and forevermore.
19:113:3/From sunrise to sunset, the LORD’s name deserves to be praised.
19:113:4/The LORD is supreme over all nations, and his glory is beyond the skies.
19:113:5/Who can compare to the LORD our God, who is seated on high,
19:113:6/Who lowers himself to look at the things in the heavens and on the earth!
19:113:7/He lifts the poor from the dust and raises the needy from the trash heap;
19:113:8/So he can seat them with princes, with the princes of his people.
19:113:9/He gives the childless woman a home, making her the happy mother of children. Praise the LORD.
19:114:1/When Israel left Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people who spoke a different language;
19:114:2/Judah became his holy place, and Israel his realm.
19:114:3/The sea saw it and ran away; the Jordan River turned back.
19:114:4/The mountains jumped like rams, and the small hills like young sheep.
19:114:5/What was wrong with you, O sea, that you ran away? O Jordan, that you turned back?
19:114:6/You mountains, why did you jump like rams; and you small hills, like young sheep?
19:114:7/Shake, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
19:114:8/Who transformed the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
19:115:1/Not for us, O LORD, not for us, but for your name give glory, because of your mercy and your truth.
19:115:2/Why should the nations ask, "Where is their God now?"
19:115:3/But our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases.
19:115:4/Their idols are just silver and gold, made by human hands.
19:115:5/They have mouths, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see;
19:115:6/They have ears, but they cannot hear; they have noses, but they cannot smell;
19:115:7/They have hands, but they cannot feel; they have feet, but they cannot walk; they cannot make a sound with their throats.
19:115:8/Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.
19:115:9/O Israel, trust in the LORD; he is their help and their shield.
19:115:10/O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; he is their help and their shield.
19:115:11/You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; he is their help and their shield.
19:115:12/The LORD remembers us and will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
19:115:13/He will bless those who fear the LORD, both the small and the great.
19:115:14/The LORD will increase you more and more, you and your children.
19:115:15/You are blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
19:115:16/The heavens are the LORD's, but the earth he has given to humanity.
19:115:17/The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence.
19:115:18/But we will bless the LORD now and forevermore. Praise the LORD.
19:116:1/I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy.
19:116:2/Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live.
19:116:3/The pains of death surrounded me, and the agony of the grave overtook me: I encountered distress and grief.
19:116:4/Then I called on the name of the LORD; "O LORD, I beg you, save my life."
19:116:5/The LORD is gracious and righteous; indeed, our God is compassionate.
19:116:6/The LORD protects the naive; when I was at my lowest, he saved me.
19:116:7/Return to your rest, my soul; for the LORD has been generous to you.
19:116:8/For you have rescued my life from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
19:116:9/I will walk in the LORD's presence in the land of the living.
19:116:10/I believed, therefore I have spoken: I was deeply afflicted.
19:116:11/I said in my haste, "Everyone is a liar."
19:116:12/What can I give back to the LORD for all his goodness to me?
19:116:13/I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.
19:116:14/I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people.
19:116:15/The death of his faithful ones is precious in the LORD's sight.
19:116:16/O LORD, I am truly your servant; I am your servant, the child of your maidservant; you have freed me from my chains.
19:116:17/I will offer you a thanksgiving sacrifice and call on the name of the LORD.
19:116:18/I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people.
19:116:19/In the courts of the LORD’s house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.
19:117:1/Praise the Lord, all you nations; honor him, all you peoples.
19:117:2/His loving kindness toward us is immense, and the Lord's truth lasts forever. Praise the Lord.
19:118:1/Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love lasts forever.
19:118:2/Let Israel say now, his love lasts forever.
19:118:3/Let the house of Aaron say now, his love lasts forever.
19:118:4/Let those who fear the LORD say now, his love lasts forever.
19:118:5/When I was in trouble, I called out to the LORD; he answered me and brought me into a spacious place.
19:118:6/The LORD is with me; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?
19:118:7/The LORD is on my side, helping me; I will see my desires fulfilled on those who hate me.
19:118:8/It's better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in humans.
19:118:9/It's better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in leaders.
19:118:10/All nations surrounded me, but in the name of the LORD, I cut them off.
19:118:11/They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the LORD, I cut them off.
19:118:12/They swarmed around me like bees, but they were extinguished like burning thorns; in the name of the LORD, I cut them off.
19:118:13/You pushed me hard to make me fall, but the LORD helped me.
19:118:14/The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.
19:118:15/Sounds of joy and victory are in the tents of the righteous: the LORD's right hand has done mighty things.
19:118:16/The LORD's right hand is lifted high; the LORD's right hand has done mighty things.
19:118:17/I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the LORD has done.
19:118:18/The LORD has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death.
19:118:19/Open for me the gates of righteousness; I will enter and give thanks to the LORD.
19:118:20/This is the LORD's gate; the righteous will enter through it.
19:118:21/I will give you thanks, for you answered me; you have become my salvation.
19:118:22/The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
19:118:23/This is the LORD's doing; it is wonderful in our eyes.
19:118:24/This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
19:118:25/Please, LORD, save us; please, LORD, grant us success.
19:118:26/Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the LORD; we bless you from the house of the LORD.
19:118:27/The LORD is God, and he has made his light shine on us. Bind the festal sacrifice with ropes, up to the horns of the altar.
19:118:28/You are my God, and I will praise you; you are my God, and I will exalt you.
19:118:29/Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love lasts forever.
19:119:1/Happy are those who are flawless in their path, who follow the LORD's law.
19:119:2/Happy are those who observe his instructions, and seek him with all their heart.
19:119:3/They also commit no wrongdoing: they follow his paths.
19:119:4/You have ordered us to diligently follow your rules.
19:119:5/I wish my ways were steadfast in obeying your decrees!
19:119:6/Then I will not feel shame, when I consider all your commands.
19:119:7/I will praise you with a sincere heart, when I learn your righteous laws.
19:119:8/I will follow your decrees: please don't completely abandon me.
19:119:9/How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word.
19:119:10/With all my heart I have sought you; don't let me stray from your commands.
19:119:11/I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.
19:119:12/Blessed are you, O LORD; teach me your decrees.
19:119:13/With my lips, I recount all the laws that come from your mouth.
19:119:14/I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great wealth.
19:119:15/I will meditate on your precepts and consider your paths.
19:119:16/I will delight in your decrees; I will not forget your word.
19:119:17/Be generous to your servant, so I may live and keep your word.
19:119:18/Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.
19:119:19/I am a stranger on earth; do not hide your commands from me.
19:119:20/My soul is consumed with longing for your laws at all times.
19:119:21/You rebuke the arrogant, who are cursed and stray from your commands.
19:119:22/Remove scorn and contempt from me, for I have kept your testimonies.
19:119:23/Even though rulers sit and plot against me, your servant will meditate on your statutes.
19:119:24/Your statutes are my delight; they are my counselors.
19:119:25/My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to your word.
19:119:26/I have told you my ways, and you answered me; teach me your decrees.
19:119:27/Help me understand the meaning of your precepts, so I can meditate on your wonders.
19:119:28/My soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to your word.
19:119:29/Keep me from deceitful ways; be gracious to me through your law.
19:119:30/I have chosen the way of truth; I have set my heart on your laws.
19:119:31/I hold fast to your statutes, LORD; do not let me be put to shame.
19:119:32/I run in the path of your commands, for you have broadened my understanding.
19:119:33/Teach me, LORD, the way of your decrees, that I may follow it to the end.
19:119:34/Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law and obey it with all my heart.
19:119:35/Direct me in the path of your commands, for there I find delight.
19:119:36/Turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain.
19:119:37/Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word.
19:119:38/Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you may be feared.
19:119:39/Take away the disgrace I dread, for your laws are good.
19:119:40/How I long for your precepts! In your righteousness, preserve my life.
19:119:41/May your unfailing love come to me, LORD, your salvation, according to your promise.
19:119:42/Then I can answer anyone who taunts me, for I trust in your word.
19:119:43/Never take your word of truth from my mouth, for I have put my hope in your laws.
19:119:44/I will always obey your law, for ever and ever.
19:119:45/I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts.
19:119:46/I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame.
19:119:47/For I delight in your commands because I love them.
19:119:48/I reach out for your commands, which I love, that I may meditate on your decrees.
19:119:49/Remember your word to your servant, for you have given me hope.
19:119:50/My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promise preserves my life.
19:119:51/The arrogant mock me unmercifully, but I do not turn from your law.
19:119:52/I remember, LORD, your ancient laws, and I find comfort in them.
19:119:53/Indignation grips me because of the wicked, who have forsaken your law.
19:119:54/Your decrees are the theme of my song wherever I lodge.
19:119:55/In the night, LORD, I remember your name, that I may keep your law.
19:119:56/This has been my practice: I obey your precepts.
19:119:57/You are my portion, LORD; I have promised to obey your words.
19:119:58/I have sought your face with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise.
19:119:59/I have considered my ways and have turned my steps to your statutes.
19:119:60/I will hasten and not delay to obey your commands.
19:119:61/Though the wicked bind me with ropes, I will not forget your law.
19:119:62/At midnight I rise to give you thanks for your righteous laws.
19:119:63/I am a friend to all who fear you, to all who follow your precepts.
19:119:64/The earth is filled with your love, LORD; teach me your decrees.
19:119:65/You have done good to your servant, LORD, according to your word.
19:119:66/Teach me knowledge and good judgment, for I trust your commands.
19:119:67/Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.
19:119:68/You are good, and what you do is good; teach me your decrees.
19:119:69/Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies, I keep your precepts with all my heart.
19:119:70/Their hearts are callous and unfeeling, but I delight in your law.
19:119:71/It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees.
19:119:72/The law from your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.
19:119:73/Your hands made me and formed me; give me understanding to learn your commands.
19:119:74/May those who fear you rejoice when they see me, for I have put my hope in your word.
19:119:75/I know, LORD, that your laws are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
19:119:76/May your unfailing love be my comfort, according to your promise to your servant.
19:119:77/Let your compassion come to me that I may live, for your law is my delight.
19:119:78/May the arrogant be put to shame for wronging me without cause; but I will meditate on your precepts.
19:119:79/May those who fear you turn to me, those who understand your statutes.
19:119:80/May my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may not be put to shame.
19:119:81/My soul longs for your salvation; I have put my hope in your word.
19:119:82/My eyes fail, looking for your promise; I ask, "When will you comfort me?"
19:119:83/Though I am like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget your decrees.
19:119:84/How long must your servant wait? When will you punish my persecutors?
19:119:85/The arrogant dig pits to trap me, contrary to your law.
19:119:86/All your commands are trustworthy; help me, for I am being persecuted without cause.
19:119:87/They almost wiped me from the earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts.
19:119:88/In your unfailing love, preserve my life, that I may obey the statutes of your mouth.
19:119:89/Your word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens.
19:119:90/Your faithfulness continues through all generations; you established the earth, and it endures.
19:119:91/Your laws endure to this day, for all things serve you.
19:119:92/If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
19:119:93/I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have preserved my life.
19:119:94/Save me, for I am yours; I have sought out your precepts.
19:119:95/The wicked are waiting to destroy me, but I will ponder your statutes.
19:119:96/I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commandment is exceedingly broad.
19:119:97/Oh, how I love your law! It is my meditation all day long.
19:119:98/Your commands make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever with me.
19:119:99/I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes.
19:119:100/I have more understanding than the elders, for I obey your precepts.
19:119:101/I have kept my feet from every evil path so that I might obey your word.
19:119:102/I have not turned away from your laws, for you yourself have taught me.
19:119:103/How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
19:119:104/Through your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every wrong path.
19:119:105/Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
19:119:106/I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will follow your righteous laws.
19:119:107/I am severely afflicted; give me life, LORD, according to your word.
19:119:108/Accept, LORD, the willing praise of my mouth, and teach me your laws.
19:119:109/Though I constantly take my life in my hands, I will not forget your law.
19:119:110/The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts.
19:119:111/Your statutes are my heritage forever; they are the joy of my heart.
19:119:112/My heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end.
19:119:113/I hate double-minded people, but I love your law.
19:119:114/You are my refuge and my shield; I have put my hope in your word.
19:119:115/Away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commands of my God!
19:119:116/Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed.
19:119:117/Hold me up, and I will be safe and always have regard for your statutes.
19:119:118/You reject all who stray from your decrees, for their deceitfulness is in vain.
19:119:119/You discard all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore I love your statutes.
19:119:120/My flesh trembles in fear of you; I stand in awe of your laws.
19:119:121/I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors.
19:119:122/Ensure your servant's well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me.
19:119:123/My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, looking for your righteous promise.
19:119:124/Deal with your servant according to your love and teach me your decrees.
19:119:125/I am your servant; give me discernment that I may understand your statutes.
19:119:126/It is time for you to act, LORD; your law is being broken.
19:119:127/Because I love your commands more than gold, more than pure gold,
19:119:128/and because I consider all your precepts right, I hate every wrong path.
19:119:129/Your statutes are wonderful; therefore I obey them.
19:119:130/The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.
19:119:131/I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commands.
19:119:132/Look on me and be merciful to me, as you always do to those who love your name.
19:119:133/Direct my footsteps according to your word; let no sin rule over me.
19:119:134/Redeem me from human oppression, that I may obey your precepts.
19:119:135/Make your face shine on your servant and teach me your decrees.
19:119:136/Streams of tears flow from my eyes, for your law is not obeyed.
19:119:137/You are righteous, LORD, and your laws are right.
19:119:138/The statutes you have laid down are righteous; they are fully trustworthy.
19:119:139/My zeal wears me out, for my enemies ignore your words.
19:119:140/Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them.
19:119:141/Though I am lowly and despised, I do not forget your precepts.
19:119:142/Your righteousness is everlasting and your law is true.
19:119:143/Trouble and distress have come upon me, but your commands give me delight.
19:119:144/Your statutes are always righteous; give me understanding that I may live.
19:119:145/I call with all my heart; answer me, LORD, and I will obey your decrees.
19:119:146/I call out to you; save me and I will keep your testimonies.
19:119:147/I rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word.
19:119:148/My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises.
19:119:149/Hear my voice in accordance with your love; give me life, LORD, according to your laws.
19:119:150/Those who devise wicked schemes are near, but they are far from your law.
19:119:151/You are near, LORD, and all your commands are true.
19:119:152/Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.
19:119:153/Look on my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law.
19:119:154/Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise.
19:119:155/Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek out your decrees.
19:119:156/Your compassion, LORD, is great; preserve my life according to your laws.
19:119:157/Many are my persecutors and my enemies, yet I do not turn from your statutes.
19:119:158/I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word.
19:119:159/See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, LORD, in accordance with your love.
19:119:160/All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.
19:119:161/Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word.
19:119:162/I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great treasure.
19:119:163/I hate and detest falsehood but I love your law.
19:119:164/Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws.
19:119:165/Those who love your law have great peace, and nothing can make them stumble.
19:119:166/LORD, I wait for your salvation, and I follow your commands.
19:119:167/I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly.
19:119:168/I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you.
19:119:169/May my cry come before you, LORD; give me understanding according to your word.
19:119:170/May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise.
19:119:171/May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees.
19:119:172/May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous.
19:119:173/May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
19:119:174/I long for your salvation, LORD, and your law gives me delight.
19:119:175/Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me.
19:119:176/I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I have not forgotten your commands.
19:120:1/In my distress, I called out to the LORD, and he listened to me.
19:120:2/Save my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.
19:120:3/What will be given to you? Or what will be done to you, you deceitful tongue?
19:120:4/Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
19:120:5/How miserable I am, living as a foreigner in Mesech, dwelling among the tents of Kedar!
19:120:6/My soul has lived too long with those who despise peace.
19:120:7/I am for peace, but when I speak, they are ready for battle.
19:121:1/I will look up to the mountains—where does my help come from?
19:121:2/My help comes from the LORD, the Creator of heaven and earth.
19:121:3/He won't let your foot slip—he who watches over you won't fall asleep.
19:121:4/Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
19:121:5/The LORD is your protector; the LORD is your shade at your right hand.
19:121:6/The sun won't harm you during the day, nor the moon at night.
19:121:7/The LORD will keep you safe from all harm—he will watch over your life.
19:121:8/The LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
19:122:1/I was happy when they suggested, "Let's go to the house of the LORD."
19:122:2/We will stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.
19:122:3/Jerusalem is built as a city closely united:
19:122:4/Where the tribes ascend, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony to Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
19:122:5/For there, thrones of judgment are set, the thrones of the house of David.
19:122:6/Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: those who love you will prosper.
19:122:7/May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
19:122:8/For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will now say, "Peace be within you."
19:122:9/Because of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your welfare.
19:123:1/I look up to you, who lives in the heavens.
19:123:2/Just as servants watch their master's hand, and a maiden watches her mistress's hand; we keep our eyes on the LORD our God, waiting for his mercy.
19:123:3/Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us, for we are overwhelmed with contempt.
19:123:4/Our souls are deeply burdened with the mockery of those at ease and the disdain of the proud.
19:124:1/If it hadn't been for the LORD on our side, let Israel now say;
19:124:2/If it hadn't been for the LORD on our side, when people attacked us:
19:124:3/Then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger flared against us:
19:124:4/Then the waters would have engulfed us, the stream would have swept over our soul:
19:124:5/Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul.
19:124:6/Blessed be the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.
19:124:7/Our soul has escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.
19:124:8/Our help is in the name of the LORD, who created heaven and earth.
19:125:1/Those who trust in the LORD will be like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but remains forever.
19:125:2/Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people now and forever.
19:125:3/The wicked will not oppress the righteous forever, so that the righteous won't be tempted to do wrong.
19:125:4/Please bless those who are good, O LORD, and those who have integrity in their hearts.
19:125:5/Those who turn to their crooked ways, the LORD will deal with them along with the evildoers. But peace will be with Israel.
19:126:1/When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
19:126:2/Then our mouths were filled with laughter, and our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."
19:126:3/The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.
19:126:4/Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.
19:126:5/Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.
19:126:6/Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.
19:127:1/Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it work for nothing: unless the LORD protects the city, the guard keeps watch for nothing.
19:127:2/It's pointless for you to get up early and stay up late, working hard for a living: for he gives his beloved rest.
19:127:3/Indeed, children are a gift from the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his blessing.
19:127:4/Just as arrows are in the hand of a warrior; so are children born in one's youth.
19:127:5/Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them: they will not be disgraced, but will confront their adversaries at the city gates.
19:128:1/Blessed is everyone who respects the LORD; who follows his path.
19:128:2/You will enjoy the fruits of your labor: you will be happy and it will go well for you.
19:128:3/Your wife will be like a fruitful vine by the sides of your house; your children like young olive trees around your table.
19:128:4/Indeed, this is how the man who respects the LORD will be blessed.
19:128:5/The LORD will bless you from Zion: and you will witness the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
19:128:6/Yes, you will see your children’s children, and peace upon Israel.
19:129:1/Time and again they've troubled me since I was young, let Israel now declare:
19:129:2/Time and again they've troubled me since my youth, but they haven't defeated me.
19:129:3/They plowed over my back, making their furrows long.
19:129:4/The LORD is just: he has severed the ties of the wicked.
19:129:5/May all who despise Zion be confused and turned away.
19:129:6/May they be like the grass on the rooftops, which dries up before it can grow.
19:129:7/So that the reaper cannot fill his hand, nor the one who gathers sheaves his arms.
19:129:8/Nor do passersby say, "The LORD's blessing be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD."
19:130:1/From the depths, I've cried out to you, O LORD.
19:130:2/Lord, listen to my voice: be attentive to my pleas for mercy.
19:130:3/If you, LORD, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand?
19:130:4/But with you there is forgiveness, so that you may be revered.
19:130:5/I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and I put my hope in his word.
19:130:6/My soul waits for the Lord more eagerly than those who watch for the morning, yes, more than those who watch for the morning.
19:130:7/Let Israel put their hope in the LORD, for with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is abundant redemption.
19:130:8/And he will redeem Israel from all their sins.
19:131:1/Lord, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes arrogant: I don't concern myself with matters too grand or beyond my reach.
19:131:2/Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself, like a child who has been weaned from its mother: my soul is like a weaned child.
19:131:3/Let Israel put their hope in the LORD from now on and forever.
19:132:1/Lord, remember David and all his hardships.
19:132:2/How he swore to the LORD and made a promise to the mighty God of Jacob;
19:132:3/"I certainly won't enter my house or get into my bed;
19:132:4/I won't allow myself to sleep or even to rest,
19:132:5/Until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the mighty God of Jacob."
19:132:6/Indeed, we heard about it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
19:132:7/We will go into his dwelling places; we will worship at his footstool.
19:132:8/Rise up, O LORD, to your resting place; you and the ark of your might.
19:132:9/May your priests be clothed with integrity; and let your faithful ones shout for joy.
19:132:10/Do not turn your back on your servant David for the sake of your anointed one.
19:132:11/The LORD has made a faithful promise to David; he will not go back on it: "From your descendants, I will place one on your throne.
19:132:12/If your children keep my covenant and my teachings that I will teach them, then their children too will sit on your throne forever."
19:132:13/For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling.
19:132:14/"This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
19:132:15/I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her needy with bread.
19:132:16/I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will shout for joy.
19:132:17/There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
19:132:18/His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him, his crown will shine."
19:133:1/Look, how wonderful and delightful it is when brothers live together in harmony!
19:133:2/It's like the valuable oil on the head, flowing down onto the beard, even Aaron's beard, flowing down to the hem of his robes.
19:133:3/It's like the dew of Hermon falling on Mount Zion's slopes. For there, the LORD has decreed blessings, even eternal life.
19:134:1/Look, praise the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, who stand by night in the house of the LORD.
19:134:2/Raise your hands in the holy place, and praise the LORD.
19:134:3/May the LORD who created heaven and earth bless you from Zion.
19:135:1/Praise the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD; praise him, all you servants of the LORD.
19:135:2/You who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of our God's house.
19:135:3/Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises to his name, for it is delightful.
19:135:4/For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel as his special treasure.
19:135:5/For I know that the LORD is great, and our Lord is above all gods.
19:135:6/Whatever the LORD wishes, he does in heaven and on earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
19:135:7/He makes the vapors rise from the ends of the earth; he creates lightning for the rain; he brings the wind from his storehouses.
19:135:8/Who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both human and animal.
19:135:9/Who sent miraculous signs and wonders into the heart of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
19:135:10/Who defeated great nations and killed mighty kings;
19:135:11/Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;
19:135:12/And gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people.
19:135:13/Your name, O LORD, endures forever; your renown, O LORD, through all generations.
19:135:14/For the LORD will judge his people, and he will have compassion on his servants.
19:135:15/The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by human hands.
19:135:16/They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
19:135:17/They have ears, but cannot hear; nor is there any breath in their mouths.
19:135:18/Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.
19:135:19/Bless the LORD, O house of Israel; bless the LORD, O house of Aaron;
19:135:20/Bless the LORD, O house of Levi; all who revere the LORD, bless the LORD.
19:135:21/Blessed be the LORD from Zion, who lives in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.
19:136:1/Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love lasts forever.
19:136:2/Give thanks to the God of gods; his love lasts forever.
19:136:3/Give thanks to the Lord of lords; his love lasts forever.
19:136:4/To the one who alone performs great wonders; his love lasts forever.
19:136:5/To the one who skillfully created the heavens; his love lasts forever.
19:136:6/To the one who spread out the earth over the waters; his love lasts forever.
19:136:7/To the one who made the great lights; his love lasts forever:
19:136:8/The sun to govern the day; his love lasts forever:
19:136:9/The moon and stars to govern the night; his love lasts forever.
19:136:10/To the one who struck down Egypt's firstborn; his love lasts forever:
19:136:11/And brought Israel out from among them; his love lasts forever:
19:136:12/With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; his love lasts forever.
19:136:13/To the one who split the Red Sea in two; his love lasts forever:
19:136:14/And made Israel walk through the middle of it; his love lasts forever:
19:136:15/But swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea; his love lasts forever.
19:136:16/To the one who led his people through the wilderness; his love lasts forever.
19:136:17/To the one who struck down great kings; his love lasts forever:
19:136:18/And killed mighty kings; his love lasts forever:
19:136:19/Sihon, king of the Amorites; his love lasts forever:
19:136:20/And Og, king of Bashan; his love lasts forever:
19:136:21/And gave their land as an inheritance; his love lasts forever:
19:136:22/An inheritance to Israel his servant; his love lasts forever.
19:136:23/Who remembered us in our lowly state; his love lasts forever:
19:136:24/And freed us from our enemies; his love lasts forever.
19:136:25/Who provides food for all living things; his love lasts forever.
19:136:26/Give thanks to the God of heaven; his love lasts forever.
19:137:1/By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we cried, when we remembered Zion.
19:137:2/We hung our harps on the willow trees there.
19:137:3/For there, our captors demanded a song from us; our oppressors demanded joy, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
19:137:4/How can we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land?
19:137:5/If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand lose its skill.
19:137:6/If I do not remember you, let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth; if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy.
19:137:7/Remember, O LORD, the Edomites on the day Jerusalem fell; they said, "Tear it down, tear it down, all the way to its foundations."
19:137:8/O daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction; happy is the one who repays you according to what you have done to us.
19:137:9/Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
19:138:1/I will praise you with all my heart; in the presence of the gods, I will sing your praise.
19:138:2/I will bow down toward your holy temple and praise your name for your unfailing love and your faithfulness, for you have elevated your promise above your entire reputation.
19:138:3/When I called out, you answered me; you made me bold and strong.
19:138:4/All the kings of the earth will praise you, LORD, when they hear what you have promised.
19:138:5/Yes, they will sing about the LORD's ways, for the glory of the LORD is great.
19:138:6/Though the LORD is exalted, he looks kindly on the lowly; though lofty, he sees them from afar.
19:138:7/Even when I'm surrounded by troubles, you will keep me alive. You will oppose my enemies' anger, and your right hand will save me.
19:138:8/The LORD will accomplish what concerns me; your love, O LORD, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands.
19:139:1/Lord, you have searched me and know me well.
19:139:2/You know when I sit and when I rise; you understand my thoughts from afar.
19:139:3/You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.
19:139:4/Before a word is on my tongue, you, LORD, know it completely.
19:139:5/You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.
19:139:6/Such knowledge is too amazing for me; it is so high, I cannot grasp it.
19:139:7/Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?
19:139:8/If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
19:139:9/If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,
19:139:10/Even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.
19:139:11/If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,"
19:139:12/Even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
19:139:13/For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.
19:139:14/I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.
19:139:15/My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
19:139:16/Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.
19:139:17/How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!
19:139:18/Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand—when I awake, I am still with you.
19:139:19/Surely you will slay the wicked, O God; away from me, you who are bloodthirsty.
19:139:20/They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.
19:139:21/Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?
19:139:22/I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.
19:139:23/Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.
19:139:24/See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
19:140:1/Save me, O LORD, from evil people; protect me from those who are violent;
19:140:2/Who plan evil things in their hearts and constantly stir up conflicts.
19:140:3/They make their tongues as sharp as a snake's; the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah.
19:140:4/Protect me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; keep me safe from violent people who try to trip me up.
19:140:5/The arrogant have hidden traps for me; they have spread out nets by the roadside; they have set snares for me. Selah.
19:140:6/I say to the LORD, "You are my God; listen to my pleas for mercy, O LORD."
19:140:7/O LORD, my mighty savior, you shield my head on the day of battle.
19:140:8/Do not grant the wicked their desires, O LORD; do not let their plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah.
19:140:9/May the trouble they cause recoil on themselves; may the harm of their own lips engulf them.
19:140:10/May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.
19:140:11/May no slanderer be established in the land; may disaster hunt down the violent to overthrow them.
19:140:12/I am confident that the LORD will uphold the cause of the oppressed and the rights of the poor.
19:140:13/Indeed, the righteous will praise your name; the upright will live in your presence.
19:141:1/Lord, I call out to you: hurry to help me; listen to my voice when I call to you.
19:141:2/May my prayer be like incense before you; and the raising of my hands like the evening offering.
19:141:3/Place a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; protect the entrance to my lips.
19:141:4/Don't let my heart be drawn to evil, to engage in wicked deeds with those who do wrong: and let me not partake in their delicacies.
19:141:5/If the righteous correct me, it's a kindness; if they reprimand me, it's like precious oil that won't harm me: for even then, my prayer will be for their well-being in their troubles.
19:141:6/When their leaders are toppled on rocky grounds, they will listen to my words; for they are gentle.
19:141:7/Our bones are scattered at the edge of the grave, like wood chopped and split on the ground.
19:141:8/But my eyes are on you, O GOD the Lord: I trust in you; do not leave me helpless.
19:141:9/Protect me from the traps they have set for me, and from the snares of those who do evil.
19:141:10/May the wicked fall into their own traps, while I pass by safely.
19:142:1/I cried out to the LORD with my voice; I made my plea to the LORD with my voice.
19:142:2/I spilled out my concerns before him; I revealed my troubles to him.
19:142:3/When my spirit felt crushed within me, you knew my path. In the way I walked, they secretly set a trap for me.
19:142:4/I looked to my right and saw no one recognized me: I found no refuge; no one cared for my soul.
19:142:5/I cried to you, O LORD: I said, You are my refuge and my share in the land of the living.
19:142:6/Listen to my cry; for I am very low: rescue me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
19:142:7/Free my soul from prison, so I may praise your name: the righteous will surround me; for you will treat me generously.
19:143:1/Listen to my prayer, O LORD, pay attention to my pleas for help: in your faithfulness give me an answer, and in your righteousness.
19:143:2/And do not judge your servant too harshly: because no one alive can be considered righteous before you.
19:143:3/For the enemy has pursued me relentlessly; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has forced me to live in darkness, like those long dead.
19:143:4/That's why my spirit feels so overwhelmed; my heart is desolate and lonely.
19:143:5/I think back on the days gone by; I ponder all your deeds; I reflect on the work of your hands.
19:143:6/I reach out for you with all my being: my soul longs for you, like a parched land yearns for rain. Selah.
19:143:7/Answer me quickly, O LORD: my spirit is failing: do not hide your face from me, or I will be like those who fall into the abyss.
19:143:8/Let me hear of your unfailing love in the morning; for I put my trust in you: show me the path I should follow; for I offer my soul to you.
19:143:9/Rescue me, O LORD, from my enemies: I run to you to find shelter.
19:143:10/Teach me to follow your will; for you are my God: your spirit is good; guide me to a land of righteousness.
19:143:11/Revive me, O LORD, for the sake of your name: for the sake of your righteousness, bring my soul out of distress.
19:143:12/In your mercy, eliminate my foes, and destroy all those who trouble my soul: for I am your servant.
19:144:1/Praise be to the LORD, my strength, who trains my hands for battle and my fingers for war.
19:144:2/My kindness, and my stronghold; my towering refuge, and my savior; my protector, and the one I trust; who brings my people under my control.
19:144:3/LORD, what is a human, that you are mindful of them! Or a human being, that you care for them!
19:144:4/Humans are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.
19:144:5/Part the heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so they smoke.
19:144:6/Send out your lightning and scatter them; shoot your arrows and rout them.
19:144:7/Stretch out your hand from on high; rescue me and deliver me from deep waters, from the grasp of foreigners,
19:144:8/Whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are hands of deceit.
19:144:9/I will sing a new song to you, O God; on a ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you.
19:144:10/It is you who gives victory to kings; who rescues David your servant from the deadly sword.
19:144:11/Rescue me and deliver me from the grasp of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are hands of deceit.
19:144:12/So that our sons may be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
19:144:13/So that our barns may be filled with every kind of provision. That our sheep may increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;
19:144:14/That our oxen may be loaded with produce; that there be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of distress in our streets.
19:144:15/Blessed are the people who are in such a state; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.
19:145:1/I will praise you, my God, O king; and I will bless your name forever and ever.
19:145:2/Every day I will bless you; and I will praise your name forever and ever.
19:145:3/The LORD is great, and highly to be praised; and his greatness is beyond understanding.
19:145:4/One generation will praise your works to another, and will tell of your mighty acts.
19:145:5/I will talk about the glorious splendor of your majesty, and about your amazing works.
19:145:6/And people will talk about the power of your awesome acts: and I will proclaim your greatness.
19:145:7/They will overflow with memories of your great goodness, and will sing of your righteousness.
19:145:8/The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and rich in mercy.
19:145:9/The LORD is good to everyone: and his compassion is over all his creations.
19:145:10/All your works will praise you, O LORD; and your faithful ones will bless you.
19:145:11/They will talk about the glory of your kingdom, and discuss your power;
19:145:12/To make known to humanity your mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
19:145:13/Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion lasts through all generations.
19:145:14/The LORD supports all who fall, and lifts up all who are bowed down.
19:145:15/The eyes of all look to you; and you give them their food at the right time.
19:145:16/You open your hand, and satisfy the desires of every living thing.
19:145:17/The LORD is just in all his ways, and kind in all his works.
19:145:18/The LORD is close to all who call on him, to all who call on him sincerely.
19:145:19/He will fulfill the desires of those who fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
19:145:20/The LORD watches over all who love him: but all the wicked he will destroy.
19:145:21/My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD: and let all beings bless his holy name forever and ever.
19:146:1/Celebrate the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
19:146:2/As long as I live, I will praise the LORD: I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
19:146:3/Don't place your trust in leaders, nor in humans, who cannot save.
19:146:4/When they breathe their last, they return to the earth; on that very day their plans come to nothing.
19:146:5/Joyful is the one who has the God of Jacob for their help, whose hope is in the LORD their God.
19:146:6/Who created the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything in them, who keeps faith forever.
19:146:7/Who acts justly for those who are oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free.
19:146:8/The LORD gives sight to the blind, lifts up those who are bowed down, the LORD loves the just.
19:146:9/The LORD protects the foreigners; He supports the fatherless and the widow, but He frustrates the ways of the wicked.
19:146:10/The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Celebrate the LORD.
19:147:1/Praise the LORD, because it's good to sing praises to our God; it's delightful, and praise looks good on us.
19:147:2/The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; he brings back the exiles of Israel.
19:147:3/He heals those with broken hearts and wraps up their wounds.
19:147:4/He counts the stars and calls each by name.
19:147:5/Our Lord is great and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.
19:147:6/The LORD lifts up the humble; he throws the wicked down to the ground.
19:147:7/Sing to the LORD with gratitude; play the harp and sing praises to our God.
19:147:8/He covers the sky with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, and makes grass grow on the hills.
19:147:9/He provides food for the animals and for the young ravens when they cry.
19:147:10/He doesn't care for the strength of a horse or admire the legs of a man.
19:147:11/The LORD delights in those who respect him, those who hope in his loving kindness.
19:147:12/Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.
19:147:13/For he has fortified your gates; he has blessed your children within you.
19:147:14/He brings peace to your borders and fills you with the finest wheat.
19:147:15/He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly.
19:147:16/He gives snow like wool; he scatters frost like ashes.
19:147:17/He hurls down his hail like crumbs; who can withstand his cold?
19:147:18/He sends out his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.
19:147:19/He reveals his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to Israel.
19:147:20/He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the LORD.
19:148:1/Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the highest places.
19:148:2/Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly forces.
19:148:3/Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.
19:148:4/Praise him, highest heavens, and you waters above the skies.
19:148:5/Let them praise the name of the LORD, for at his command they were created.
19:148:6/He has established them forever and ever; he issued a decree that will never pass away.
19:148:7/Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths;
19:148:8/Fire and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding;
19:148:9/Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars;
19:148:10/Wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds;
19:148:11/Kings of the earth and all nations, princes and all rulers on earth;
19:148:12/Young men and women, old people and children;
19:148:13/Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens.
19:148:14/He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his faithful servants, for the children of Israel, a people close to him. Praise the LORD.
19:149:1/Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song, and praise him in the gathering of his faithful people.
19:149:2/Let Israel be glad in their Maker; let the people of Zion rejoice in their King.
19:149:3/Let them praise his name with dancing; let them sing praises to him with the drum and harp.
19:149:4/For the LORD delights in his people; he crowns the humble with victory.
19:149:5/Let the faithful rejoice in this honor; let them sing for joy on their beds.
19:149:6/Let the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands;
19:149:7/To carry out vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples;
19:149:8/To bind their kings with chains and their nobles with iron shackles;
19:149:9/To carry out the sentence written against them—this is the glory of all his faithful people. Praise the LORD.
19:150:1/Celebrate the LORD. Praise God in his holy place; praise him in the vast expanse of his power.
19:150:2/Praise him for his powerful deeds; praise him for his immense greatness.
19:150:3/Praise him with the blast of the trumpet; praise him with the lyre and harp.
19:150:4/Praise him with the tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and pipe.
19:150:5/Praise him with the loud clashing cymbals; praise him with the resounding cymbals.
19:150:6/Let everything that breathes celebrate the LORD. Celebrate the LORD.
20:1:1/The sayings of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel;
20:1:2/To grasp wisdom and instruction; to understand the meaning of insightful words;
20:1:3/To receive guidance on wisdom, fairness, justice, and integrity;
20:1:4/To offer cleverness to the naive, and to the young person, knowledge and thoughtfulness.
20:1:5/A wise person listens and gains more knowledge; a person of understanding seeks out wise advice;
20:1:6/To grasp a proverb and its meaning; the sayings of the wise and their riddles.
20:1:7/Respecting the LORD is the start of knowledge: but fools reject wisdom and guidance.
20:1:8/My child, listen to your father's guidance, and do not ignore your mother's teachings;
20:1:9/For they will be like a graceful garland on your head and necklaces around your neck.
20:1:10/My child, if sinners try to tempt you, do not give in.
20:1:11/If they say, "Come with us, let's hide and wait to attack someone innocent for no reason;
20:1:12/Let's swallow them whole, like the grave; completely, as those who go down to the pit;
20:1:13/We'll find all kinds of valuable things and fill our homes with loot;
20:1:14/Join us, and we'll all share the loot";
20:1:15/My child, do not go along with them, stay away from their path;
20:1:16/For their feet rush into evil, they're quick to shed blood.
20:1:17/Indeed, it's pointless to set a net where any bird can see it.
20:1:18/But these people set a trap for their own blood; they ambush only themselves.
20:1:19/That's the fate of all who are greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.
20:1:20/Wisdom calls out in the open; she raises her voice in the public squares;
20:1:21/She cries out at the busiest corners, at the city gates she speaks her words, saying,
20:1:22/"How long, you naive people, will you love being simple-minded? Scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
20:1:23/Turn at my warning: see, I will pour out my spirit on you, I will make my words known to you.
20:1:24/Because I called and you refused; I reached out, and no one paid attention;
20:1:25/But you ignored all my advice, and did not want my correction;
20:1:26/I too will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when what you fear comes;
20:1:27/When what you fear comes like a storm, and your disaster comes like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you.
20:1:28/Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will look for me, but will not find me:
20:1:29/Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose to respect the LORD:
20:1:30/They wanted none of my advice; they despised all my correction.
20:1:31/Therefore, they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes.
20:1:32/For the waywardness of the naive will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
20:1:33/But whoever listens to me will live securely and be at ease, without fear of harm.
20:2:1/My child, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you;
20:2:2/So that you turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;
20:2:3/Indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding;
20:2:4/If you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure;
20:2:5/Then you will understand what it means to fear the LORD, and you will gain knowledge of God.
20:2:6/For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20:2:7/He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
20:2:8/He guards the courses of justice and protects the way of his faithful ones.
20:2:9/Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—every good path.
20:2:10/When wisdom enters your heart, and knowledge is delightful to your soul,
20:2:11/Discretion will protect you, understanding will guard you,
20:2:12/To save you from the way of the wicked, from those who speak twisted things;
20:2:13/Who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways;
20:2:14/Who take joy in doing wrong and delight in the perverseness of evil,
20:2:15/Whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their course;
20:2:16/To save you from the outsider woman, from the foreigner with her smooth words,
20:2:17/Who leaves the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.
20:2:18/For her house leads down to death, and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
20:2:19/None who go to her come back or regain the paths of life.
20:2:20/So you may walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
20:2:21/For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
20:2:22/But the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
20:3:1/My child, do not forget my teaching; let your heart hold onto my instructions.
20:3:2/For they will bring you a long and peaceful life.
20:3:3/Never let go of kindness and truth; wear them like a necklace, write them deep within your heart.
20:3:4/Then you will gain favor and a good reputation in the sight of God and people.
20:3:5/Trust in the LORD with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.
20:3:6/In everything you do, put God first, and he will guide your steps.
20:3:7/Do not think you know everything; respect the LORD and avoid wrongdoing.
20:3:8/This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.
20:3:9/Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce.
20:3:10/Then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.
20:3:11/My child, do not resent the LORD's discipline, and do not be upset by his correction.
20:3:12/For the LORD disciplines those he loves, just as a father disciplines the child he delights in.
20:3:13/Joyful is the person who finds wisdom, the one who gains understanding.
20:3:14/For wisdom is more profitable than silver, and her wages are better than gold.
20:3:15/She is more valuable than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.
20:3:16/Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
20:3:17/Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.
20:3:18/She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy.
20:3:19/The LORD created the earth by wisdom; by understanding he established the heavens.
20:3:20/By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth, and the dew settles from the sky.
20:3:21/My child, don't lose sight of them; preserve sound wisdom and discretion.
20:3:22/They will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.
20:3:23/Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.
20:3:24/When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
20:3:25/Do not fear sudden terror or the ruin that overtakes the wicked.
20:3:26/For the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.
20:3:27/Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help.
20:3:28/Do not say to your neighbor, "Go away, come back later; I'll give it tomorrow" when you have it with you.
20:3:29/Do not plan harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.
20:3:30/Do not quarrel with someone for no reason when they have done you no harm.
20:3:31/Do not envy a violent person or choose any of their ways.
20:3:32/For the LORD detests the perverse but takes the upright into his confidence.
20:3:33/The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.
20:3:34/He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
20:3:35/The wise will inherit honor, but fools get only shame.
20:4:1/Listen, children, to a father's guidance, and pay attention to gain understanding.
20:4:2/For I offer you sound teaching; do not abandon my instruction.
20:4:3/I was once my father's child, gentle and the only one cherished by my mother.
20:4:4/He also taught me, saying, "Hold my words in your heart: follow my commands, and you will live."
20:4:5/Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding: do not forget it; nor turn away from what I say.
20:4:6/Do not abandon her, and she will protect you; love her, and she will guard you.
20:4:7/Wisdom is the most important thing; so get wisdom, and with all your efforts gain understanding.
20:4:8/Value her highly, and she will elevate you; she will honor you if you embrace her.
20:4:9/She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will present you with a glorious crown.
20:4:10/Listen, my son, and accept my words; and you will have a long life.
20:4:11/I have guided you in the ways of wisdom; I have led you on straight paths.
20:4:12/When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; and if you run, you will not stumble.
20:4:13/Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life.
20:4:14/Do not set foot on the path of the wicked, or walk in the way of evildoers.
20:4:15/Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn away from it and pass on.
20:4:16/For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.
20:4:17/For they consume the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
20:4:18/But the path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
20:4:19/The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.
20:4:20/My son, pay attention to my words; turn your ear to my sayings.
20:4:21/Do not let them out of your sight; keep them within your heart.
20:4:22/For they are life to those who find them, and health to one's whole body.
20:4:23/Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.
20:4:24/Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
20:4:25/Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.
20:4:26/Carefully consider the path for your feet, and all your ways will be sure.
20:4:27/Do not swerve to the right or to the left; keep your foot from evil.
20:5:1/My son, pay attention to my wisdom, and listen closely to my understanding:
20:5:2/So you may exercise caution, and your words may hold knowledge.
20:5:3/For the words of a seductive woman are sweet as honey, and her speech is smoother than oil:
20:5:4/But in the end, she is as bitter as poison, sharp as a double-edged sword.
20:5:5/Her path leads to death; her steps are bound for destruction.
20:5:6/So you might not think about the path of life, her ways are unpredictable, and you cannot know them.
20:5:7/Listen to me now, therefore, O children, and do not stray from the words of my mouth.
20:5:8/Stay far away from her, and do not go near the door of her house:
20:5:9/Or you might lose your dignity to others, and your years to someone merciless:
20:5:10/Or strangers might consume your wealth; and your hard work might end up in the house of a stranger;
20:5:11/And you grieve at the end, when your flesh and body are spent,
20:5:12/And say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart scorned correction;
20:5:13/And did not listen to the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!
20:5:14/I was on the verge of complete ruin in the midst of the community and assembly."
20:5:15/Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
20:5:16/Let your springs spread out, streams of water in the public squares.
20:5:17/Keep them for yourself alone, not for sharing with strangers.
20:5:18/May your fountain be blessed, and take joy in the wife of your youth.
20:5:19/May she be as a loving deer and graceful doe; let her breasts always satisfy you; be intoxicated always with her love.
20:5:20/And why, my son, would you be captivated by a seductive woman, and embrace the chest of a stranger?
20:5:21/For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.
20:5:22/His own wrongdoings will trap the wicked man, and he will be caught in the ropes of his sin.
20:5:23/He will die for lack of discipline; led astray by his great folly.
20:6:1/My child, if you've promised to pay for a friend's debt or shaken hands on a deal with a stranger,
20:6:2/You've trapped yourself with your own words, caught by what you've said.
20:6:3/Do this now, my child, and free yourself, since you've fallen into your friend's hands; go, humble yourself, and plead with your friend.
20:6:4/Don't allow yourself to sleep or even to blink until you've escaped.
20:6:5/Free yourself like a deer from a hunter's grasp, and like a bird from the snare of a fowler.
20:6:6/Consider the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and become wise:
20:6:7/It has no leader, overseer, or ruler,
20:6:8/Yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.
20:6:9/How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?
20:6:10/Just a little more sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest:
20:6:11/And then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.
20:6:12/A troublemaker and a villain goes around with a corrupt mouth.
20:6:13/He signals with his eyes, shuffles his feet, and points with his fingers;
20:6:14/Deceit is in his heart, he constantly schemes evil; he stirs up conflict.
20:6:15/Therefore, his disaster will strike suddenly; in an instant, he will be broken beyond healing.
20:6:16/There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:
20:6:17/Arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent,
20:6:18/A heart that plots evil, feet that hurry to do wrong,
20:6:19/A false witness who pours out lies, and anyone who stirs up conflict among friends.
20:6:20/My child, obey your father's commands, and don't neglect your mother's instruction:
20:6:21/Keep them always in your heart; tie them around your neck.
20:6:22/When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.
20:6:23/For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,
20:6:24/To protect you from the wicked woman, from the smooth talk of a wayward woman.
20:6:25/Don't lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.
20:6:26/For a prostitute can reduce you to a loaf of bread, and an adulteress preys upon your very life.
20:6:27/Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?
20:6:28/Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?
20:6:29/So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
20:6:30/People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving;
20:6:31/Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.
20:6:32/But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.
20:6:33/He will suffer wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
20:6:34/For jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
20:6:35/He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse a bribe, no matter how great.
20:7:1/My child, hold onto my words, and treasure my commandments within you.
20:7:2/Follow my commandments, and you will live; cherish my law as you would the pupil of your eye.
20:7:3/Tie them around your fingers, inscribe them on the tablet of your heart.
20:7:4/Tell wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your close relative:
20:7:5/So they can protect you from the unfamiliar woman, from the outsider who sweet talks with her words.
20:7:6/From the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice,
20:7:7/And saw among the naive, I noticed among the young men, a young man lacking sense,
20:7:8/Walking down the street near her corner; he took the path to her house,
20:7:9/In the twilight, in the evening, in the pitch-black night:
20:7:10/And there, he met a woman dressed like a prostitute, cunning of heart.
20:7:11/(She is loud and defiant; her feet do not stay at home:
20:7:12/Now in the streets, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.)
20:7:13/So she grabbed him, kissed him, and with a brazen face said to him,
20:7:14/"I have peace offerings with me; today I have fulfilled my vows.
20:7:15/That's why I came out to meet you, to search for you eagerly, and I have found you.
20:7:16/I have adorned my bed with colorful linens, with intricate carvings, with fine linen from Egypt.
20:7:17/I have scented my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
20:7:18/Come, let's enjoy passionate love until morning; let's delight ourselves with love.
20:7:19/For my husband is not at home, he has gone on a long trip:
20:7:20/He took a bag of money with him, and will return at the set time."
20:7:21/With her persuasive speech she led him astray; with her smooth talk she seduced him.
20:7:22/He followed her immediately, like an ox going to the slaughter, or like a fool to the punishment of the stocks;
20:7:23/Until an arrow pierces his liver; like a bird rushing into a trap, not knowing it will cost him his life.
20:7:24/Listen to me now then, my children, and pay attention to the words of my mouth.
20:7:25/Do not let your heart turn to her ways, do not stray into her paths.
20:7:26/For she has brought down many wounded; indeed, many strong men have been killed by her.
20:7:27/Her house is the path to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.
20:8:1/Doesn't wisdom call out? And understanding raise her voice?
20:8:2/She stands at the top of high places, by the road, at the crossroads.
20:8:3/She cries out at the city gates, at the entrance of the city, at the doorways.
20:8:4/To you, O people, I call out; my voice is for all humanity.
20:8:5/You who are naive, grasp wisdom; and you fools, gain a heart of understanding.
20:8:6/Listen, for I will speak of noble things; and from my lips will come what is right.
20:8:7/For my mouth will utter truth; and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
20:8:8/All the words of my mouth are just; there is nothing twisted or deceitful in them.
20:8:9/They are clear to those who understand, and straightforward to those who find knowledge.
20:8:10/Choose my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge over the finest gold.
20:8:11/For wisdom is more precious than rubies; and nothing you desire can compare with her.
20:8:12/I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I attain knowledge and discretion.
20:8:13/The fear of the LORD means hating evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior, and perverse speech.
20:8:14/I possess counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have power.
20:8:15/Through me kings reign, and rulers issue decrees that are just.
20:8:16/Through me princes govern, and nobles, all the judges of the earth.
20:8:17/I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently will find me.
20:8:18/With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.
20:8:19/My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.
20:8:20/I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
20:8:21/Granting wealth to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
20:8:22/The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old.
20:8:23/I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be.
20:8:24/When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, when there were no springs overflowing with water.
20:8:25/Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,
20:8:26/Before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.
20:8:27/When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the surface of the deep,
20:8:28/When he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,
20:8:29/When he set the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
20:8:30/Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,
20:8:31/Rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.
20:8:32/Now then, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.
20:8:33/Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not disregard it.
20:8:34/Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.
20:8:35/For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.
20:8:36/But those who miss me harm themselves; all who hate me love death.
20:9:1/Wisdom has built her house; she has set up its seven pillars.
20:9:2/She has prepared her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
20:9:3/She has sent out her servants, and she calls from the highest points of the city,
20:9:4/"If you're naive, come this way." To those lacking sense, she says,

20:27:16/Hiding them is like trying to grasp the wind, or like holding oil in your right hand.
20:27:17/Iron sharpens iron; so one person sharpens another.
20:27:18/Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit; so he who looks after his master will be honored.
20:27:19/Just as water reflects a face, so a person's heart reflects the person.
20:27:20/Death and destruction are never satisfied; likewise, human eyes are never content.
20:27:21/Just as refining silver and gold tests their quality, so a person is tested by the praise they receive.
20:27:22/Even if you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, their foolishness will not leave them.
20:27:23/Make sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds.
20:27:24/For wealth is not forever, nor does a crown last from generation to generation.
20:27:25/When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
20:27:26/The lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.
20:27:27/And you will have enough goat's milk for your food, for the food of your household, and for the sustenance of your servant girls.
20:28:1/The wicked run away when no one is chasing them, but the righteous are as confident as a lion.
20:28:2/When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but with a person of understanding and knowledge, its stability will last.
20:28:3/A poor person who oppresses the less fortunate is like a rain that destroys all crops.
20:28:4/Those who abandon the law praise the wicked, but those who follow the law fight against them.
20:28:5/Wicked people do not understand what is fair, but those who seek the LORD understand everything.
20:28:6/It's better to be poor and live with integrity than to be crooked in your ways, even if you're wealthy.
20:28:7/Someone who follows the law is a wise child, but a companion of gluttons disgraces their father.
20:28:8/Someone who increases their wealth through excessive interest and unfair gain collects it for someone who will be kind to the poor.
20:28:9/Anyone who turns their ear away from listening to the law, even their prayers are detestable.
20:28:10/Whoever leads the righteous astray in an evil path will fall into their own trap, but the upright will inherit good things.
20:28:11/A rich person may think they're wise, but a poor person with discernment can see right through them.
20:28:12/When the righteous triumph, there is great celebration, but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.
20:28:13/Someone who hides their sins won't succeed, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.
20:28:14/Blessed is the person who always fears the LORD, but one who hardens their heart will fall into trouble.
20:28:15/A wicked ruler over the poor is as threatening as a roaring lion or a charging bear.
20:28:16/A ruler lacking in understanding is also a great oppressor, but one who hates dishonest gain will live a long life.
20:28:17/A person who is violent against another's life will run to the pit; let no one hold them back.
20:28:18/Those who walk in integrity will be rescued, but those who are crooked in their ways will fall all at once.
20:28:19/Someone who works their land will have plenty of food, but one who chases fantasies will have their fill of poverty.
20:28:20/A trustworthy person will be showered with blessings, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.
20:28:21/Showing favoritism is not good—because for a piece of bread, a person will do wrong.
20:28:22/Someone eager to get rich has an envious eye and doesn't realize that poverty will come upon them.
20:28:23/Someone who rebukes a person will later find more favor than one who flatters with their tongue.
20:28:24/Anyone who steals from their father or mother and says, "It's not wrong," is a partner to a destroyer.
20:28:25/Someone with a haughty heart stirs up conflict, but those who trust in the LORD will prosper.
20:28:26/Those who trust in their own heart are fools, but those who walk in wisdom will be kept safe.
20:28:27/Whoever gives to the poor will not want, but one who closes their eyes to them will receive many curses.
20:28:28/When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding, but when they perish, the righteous increase.
20:29:1/Someone who is repeatedly corrected but remains stubborn will suddenly be destroyed beyond repair.
20:29:2/When good leaders are in charge, the people are happy; but when the bad ones rule, the people grieve.
20:29:3/Anyone who loves wisdom makes their father proud, but someone who hangs out with prostitutes wastes their wealth.
20:29:4/A king establishes the country through fair judgment, but one who accepts bribes ruins it.
20:29:5/A person who flatters their neighbor is setting a trap for them.
20:29:6/An evil person's wrongdoing is a trap for them, but the righteous can sing and be happy.
20:29:7/Good people care about the needs of the poor; the wicked couldn't care less.
20:29:8/Mockers can cause trouble in a city, but the wise can calm anger.
20:29:9/Arguing with a fool, whether they get angry or laugh, leads to no peace.
20:29:10/Those who are violent hate the honest, but the righteous care about their lives.
20:29:11/A fool spills all their thoughts, but a wise person holds them back until later.
20:29:12/If a leader listens to lies, all their followers are corrupt.
20:29:13/The poor and the liar have this in common: the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.
20:29:14/A king who judges the poor fairly will have a stable reign forever.
20:29:15/Discipline and correction lead to wisdom, but a child left to themselves brings shame to their mother.
20:29:16/When the wicked increase, wrongdoing increases, but the righteous will see their downfall.
20:29:17/Discipline your child, and they will bring you peace; they will bring joy to your soul.
20:29:18/Without guidance, people fall apart, but those who follow the law are happy.
20:29:19/A servant won't be corrected by mere words; even if they understand, they won't respond.
20:29:20/Do you see someone who speaks without thinking? They have less hope than a fool.
20:29:21/Someone who spoils their servant from childhood will end up with them as a child.
20:29:22/An angry person causes conflict, and someone with a temper commits many sins.
20:29:23/Pride leads to downfall, but humility brings honor.
20:29:24/Being an accomplice to a thief is hating oneself; they hear the curse but don't reveal it.
20:29:25/Fearing people is a trap, but trusting in the Lord means safety.
20:29:26/Many seek the favor of a ruler, but justice for each person comes from the Lord.
20:29:27/The unjust are detestable to the righteous, and those who are upright are detestable to the wicked.
20:30:1/The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal,
20:30:2/I am more ignorant than anyone, lacking the understanding of a human.
20:30:3/I haven't learned wisdom, nor do I possess knowledge of the holy.
20:30:4/Who has gone up to heaven and come back down? Who has collected the wind in their hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?
20:30:5/Every word of God is flawless; he is a protector to those who trust in him.
20:30:6/Do not add to his words, or he will correct you, and you will be proven a liar.
20:30:7/Two things I ask of you; do not deny them to me before I die:
20:30:8/Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches but only my daily bread.
20:30:9/Otherwise, I may have too much and deny you, saying, "Who is the LORD?" or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.
20:30:10/Do not slander a servant to their master, or they may curse you, and you will be found guilty.
20:30:11/There is a generation that curses their father and does not bless their mother.
20:30:12/There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, yet is not cleansed of their filth.
20:30:13/There is a generation—oh, how arrogant are their eyes! How their eyelids are lifted up!
20:30:14/There is a generation whose teeth are like swords and their jaws like knives, to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among humanity.
20:30:15/The leech has two daughters, crying, "Give, give." There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, "Enough":
20:30:16/The grave; the barren womb; the earth that is never satisfied with water; and the fire that never says, "Enough."
20:30:17/The eye that mocks a father and scorns obedience to a mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and young eagles will eat it.
20:30:18/There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand:
20:30:19/The way of an eagle in the sky; the way of a snake on a rock; the way of a ship on the high seas; and the way of a man with a young woman.
20:30:20/This is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I've done nothing wrong."
20:30:21/For three things the earth trembles, for four it cannot bear:
20:30:22/For a servant when they become king; a fool when they are filled with food;
20:30:23/For an unloved woman when she gets a husband; and a servant girl who displaces her mistress.
20:30:24/There are four things on earth that are small but exceedingly wise:
20:30:25/Ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;
20:30:26/Rock badgers are creatures of little power, yet they make their homes in the crags;
20:30:27/Locusts have no king, yet they all advance in ranks;
20:30:28/A lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.
20:30:29/There are three things that move with dignity, four that move well:
20:30:30/A lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing;
20:30:31/A strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king secure against rebellion.
20:30:32/If you have acted foolishly by exalting yourself or if you have planned evil, put your hand over your mouth.
20:30:33/Indeed, churning milk produces butter, and twisting a nose produces blood; so stirring up anger produces strife.
20:31:1/The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy his mother taught him.
20:31:2/What, my son? And what, the son of my womb? And what, the son of my commitments?
20:31:3/Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to those that can ruin kings.
20:31:4/It's not for kings, O Lemuel, it's not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to indulge in strong drink:
20:31:5/Otherwise, they might drink and forget the laws, and twist the rights of all the afflicted.
20:31:6/Provide strong drink to those who are dying, and wine to those with heavy hearts.
20:31:7/Let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more.
20:31:8/Speak up for those who cannot speak, in the cause of all who are destined for destruction.
20:31:9/Speak up, judge fairly, and defend the rights of the poor and needy.
20:31:10/Who can find a virtuous woman? For her value is far beyond rubies.
20:31:11/The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.
20:31:12/She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.
20:31:13/She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.
20:31:14/She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.
20:31:15/She also rises while it is still night, and provides food for her household and tasks for her maidens.
20:31:16/She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
20:31:17/She equips herself with strength, and strengthens her arms.
20:31:18/She senses that her profit is good; her lamp does not go out at night.
20:31:19/She puts her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
20:31:20/She extends her hand to the poor; yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.
20:31:21/She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
20:31:22/She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
20:31:23/Her husband is respected at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land.
20:31:24/She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.
20:31:25/Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.
20:31:26/She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
20:31:27/She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
20:31:28/Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
20:31:29/Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.
20:31:30/Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
20:31:31/Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gates.
21:1:1/The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
21:1:2/Everything is utterly meaningless, says the Teacher, completely meaningless; everything is meaningless.
21:1:3/What benefit does a person get from all their hard work under the sun?
21:1:4/One generation goes, another comes, but the earth remains forever.
21:1:5/The sun rises, and the sun sets, then rushes back to where it rises.
21:1:6/The wind blows to the south, then turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.
21:1:7/All rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the rivers come from, there they return again.
21:1:8/Everything is wearisome beyond description; no one can express it fully. The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
21:1:9/What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
21:1:10/Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.
21:1:11/Nobody remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them.
21:1:12/I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21:1:13/And I applied my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens: this heavy burden God has laid on mankind.
21:1:14/I have seen all the deeds that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is meaningless and a chasing after the wind.
21:1:15/What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.
21:1:16/I said to myself, "Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; my mind has experienced wisdom and knowledge."
21:1:17/And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I realized that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.
21:1:18/For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.
21:2:1/I told myself, "Come on, let's try pleasure. Let's look for the 'good life.'" But I found that this, too, was meaningless.
21:2:2/I said of laughter, "It's crazy," and of pleasure, "What does it accomplish?"
21:2:3/I decided to cheer myself with wine, all the while my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.
21:2:4/I undertook great projects; I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
21:2:5/I made gardens and parks, planting all kinds of fruit trees in them.
21:2:6/I created pools of water to irrigate the groves of flourishing trees.
21:2:7/I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my household. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
21:2:8/I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and the delights of a man's heart, musical instruments of all kinds.
21:2:9/So I became greater than anyone in Jerusalem before me, yet my wisdom stayed with me.
21:2:10/I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil.
21:2:11/Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.
21:2:12/Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?
21:2:13/I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.
21:2:14/The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.
21:2:15/I said to myself, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said to myself, "This too is meaningless."
21:2:16/For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die!
21:2:17/So I despised life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:2:18/I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.
21:2:19/And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
21:2:20/So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
21:2:21/For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
21:2:22/What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun?
21:2:23/All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.
21:2:24/There is nothing better for a person than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God.
21:2:25/For who can eat and who can have enjoyment more than I?
21:2:26/For to the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:3:1/For everything, there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the sky:
21:3:2/A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted;
21:3:3/A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to tear down, and a time to build;
21:3:4/A time to cry, and a time to laugh; a time to grieve, and a time to dance;
21:3:5/A time to throw stones away, and a time to gather stones together; a time to hug, and a time to avoid hugging;
21:3:6/A time to acquire, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
21:3:7/A time to tear, and a time to mend; a time to be silent, and a time to speak;
21:3:8/A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
21:3:9/What advantage does the worker gain from his toil?
21:3:10/I have observed the task that God has given humans to occupy themselves with.
21:3:11/He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart, yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
21:3:12/I know that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good throughout their lives.
21:3:13/And also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all their toil—this is God's gift to man.
21:3:14/I know that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.
21:3:15/What has been is now, and what is to be has already been; and God seeks what has been driven away.
21:3:16/Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, there was wickedness as well.
21:3:17/I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.
21:3:18/I said in my heart with regard to the condition of humans that God is testing them to show them that they are but animals.
21:3:19/For the fate of humans and the fate of animals is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and humans have no advantage over animals; for all is vanity.
21:3:20/All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all return to dust.
21:3:21/Who knows whether the spirit of humans ascends upward, and the spirit of animals descends downward to the earth?
21:3:22/So I saw that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?
21:4:1/So I went back and observed all the oppression happening under the sun: and saw the tears of the oppressed, with no one to comfort them. Power was on the side of their oppressors, yet they had no comforter.
21:4:2/That's why I praised those who are already dead more than those who are still alive.
21:4:3/Indeed, better off is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil actions done under the sun.
21:4:4/Then, I observed all the hard work and skillful endeavors, only to see that this too causes envy among people. This is also meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:4:5/The fool sits back, doing nothing, and ends up harming themselves.
21:4:6/It's better to have a little with peace than to have much with turmoil and frustration.
21:4:7/Then I looked again at the meaningless things happening under the sun.
21:4:8/There are people who are completely alone, without a partner or even a brother, yet they work endlessly, never satisfied with their wealth. They never ask themselves, "For whom am I working so hard, depriving myself of pleasure?" This too is meaningless, a miserable business.
21:4:9/Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.
21:4:10/For if they fall, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.
21:4:11/Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?
21:4:12/And if someone might overpower one person, two can resist them. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
21:4:13/A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to take advice.
21:4:14/For he might come from prison to the throne, even though in his kingdom he was born poor.
21:4:15/I saw all the living who move about under the sun, alongside that youth who steps into the king's place.
21:4:16/There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even those to come will not be happy with him. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:5:1/Be mindful of your actions when you enter the house of God, and be more eager to listen than to offer the sacrifices of fools, who don't realize they're doing wrong.
21:5:2/Don't be impulsive with your words, and don't let your heart rush to say anything before God: for God is in heaven, and you are on earth: so keep your words to a minimum.
21:5:3/Dreams come through a lot of activity; and a fool's voice is recognized by a flood of words.
21:5:4/When you make a promise to God, don't delay in fulfilling it; for he has no pleasure in fools: fulfill your promise.
21:5:5/It's better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it.
21:5:6/Don't let your mouth lead you into sin; and don't claim before the messenger that it was a mistake: why should God be angered by your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?
21:5:7/For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also various vanities: but fear God.
21:5:8/If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice and righteousness in a province, don't be amazed at the situation: for someone higher than the highest is watching; and there are higher ones than them.
21:5:9/The profit of the earth benefits everyone: the king himself is dependent on the field.
21:5:10/Whoever loves money will never be satisfied with money; nor will anyone who loves wealth be satisfied with their income: this too is meaningless.
21:5:11/When wealth increases, those who consume it increase: and what benefit is it to the owners except to gaze upon it?
21:5:12/The sleep of a laboring person is sweet, whether they eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich won't let them sleep.
21:5:13/There is a severe misfortune I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner.
21:5:14/But that wealth perishes through misfortune: and if they have a child, there is nothing in their hand.
21:5:15/Just as they came from their mother's womb, they will return as naked as they came, and will take nothing for their toil that they can carry in their hand.
21:5:16/And this too is a severe misfortune: just as they came, so will they go: and what profit do they have from toiling for the wind?
21:5:17/All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, illness, and anger.
21:5:18/See, what I have observed to be good: it is fitting to eat, drink, and enjoy the good of all one's labor under the sun during the days of one's life, which God gives them: for this is their lot.
21:5:19/Moreover, every person to whom God has given wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, and to accept their lot and find joy in their toil—this is a gift from God.
21:5:20/For they will not dwell much on the days of their life because God keeps them occupied with the joy of their heart.
21:6:1/There is a kind of evil I've observed in the world, and it's widespread among people:
21:6:2/A person whom God has blessed with wealth, riches, and honor, so that they lack nothing they desire, yet God does not grant them the ability to enjoy it, and instead, a stranger enjoys it. This is pointless and a grievous affliction.
21:6:3/Even if a person has a hundred children and lives for many years, so that their life is long, but they do not experience fulfillment or receive a decent burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than they are.
21:6:4/Because they enter the world with nothing and leave it in darkness, their name will be shrouded in obscurity.
21:6:5/Furthermore, they have not seen the sun or known anything; this state has more peace than the other.
21:6:6/Indeed, even if they live for two thousand years but do not experience anything good, don't we all end up in the same place?
21:6:7/All of a person's efforts are for their sustenance, yet their hunger is never satisfied.
21:6:8/What advantage does the wise person have over the fool? What does the poor person gain by knowing how to conduct themselves in life?
21:6:9/It is better to enjoy what you see with your eyes than to chase after your desires. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:6:10/What exists has already been named, and it is known that it is human; they cannot dispute with one who is stronger than they are.
21:6:11/Since there are so many things that increase vanity, what benefit is there for people?
21:6:12/For who knows what is good for a person during their fleeting life, which they spend like a shadow? Who can tell anyone what will happen after them under the sun?
21:7:1/A good reputation is more valuable than expensive perfume; and the day of death is better than the day of birth.
21:7:2/It's better to attend a funeral than a party: because that's everyone's fate; and the living should take it to heart.
21:7:3/Sadness is more beneficial than laughter: because through a sad face, the heart becomes better.
21:7:4/The wise person's heart is in the place of mourning; but the fool's heart is in the place of joy.
21:7:5/Listening to the criticism of the wise is better than listening to the songs of fools.
21:7:6/Just as the crackling of thorns under a pot is meaningless, so is the laughter of a fool.
21:7:7/Indeed, oppression can drive a wise person crazy; and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21:7:8/The end of something is better than its beginning: and being patient is better than being proud.
21:7:9/Don't be quick to get angry: because anger resides in the heart of fools.
21:7:10/Don't ask why the past was better than now; it's not a wise question.
21:7:11/Wisdom is beneficial when combined with an inheritance: and it benefits those who see the sun.
21:7:12/Wisdom is a protection, just as money is a protection: but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who have it.
21:7:13/Think about the work of God: for who can straighten what he has made crooked?
21:7:14/In times of success, be happy, but in difficult times, reflect: God has made one as well as the other, so that people cannot predict their future.
21:7:15/I have seen everything during my fleeting life: there is a righteous person who perishes in their righteousness, and there is a wicked person who lives long in their wickedness.
21:7:16/Don't be overly righteous or too wise: why destroy yourself?
21:7:17/Don't be too wicked or foolish: why die before your time?
21:7:18/It's good to grasp this and not let go: for the one who fears God will avoid all extremes.
21:7:19/Wisdom makes the wise stronger than ten rulers in a city.
21:7:20/For there is not a righteous person on earth who does good and never sins.
21:7:21/Also, pay no attention to every word people say; otherwise, you might hear your servant cursing you.
21:7:22/For many times, you know in your heart that you yourself have cursed others.
21:7:23/All this I tested by wisdom and said, "I will be wise," but it was beyond me.
21:7:24/What is far off and very deep, who can discover it?
21:7:25/I applied my heart to know, to investigate, and to seek wisdom and the explanation of things, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.
21:7:26/And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God will escape her, but the sinner will be caught by her.
21:7:27/See, this is what I found, says the teacher, adding one thing to another to find the explanation.
21:7:28/Which my soul still seeks but I have not found: I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these.
21:7:29/See, this only have I found, that God made humans upright, but they have sought out many schemes.
21:8:1/Who is as wise as the wise person? And who understands the meaning of things? A person's wisdom makes their face shine, and the confidence of their face will change.
21:8:2/I advise you to follow the king's command, especially because of your oath to God.
21:8:3/Don't be quick to leave his presence; don't stand for something wrong; for he does whatever he wants.
21:8:4/Where the king's word is, there's power: and who can question him, saying, "What are you doing?"
21:8:5/Anyone who follows the command will not experience harm; and a wise person's heart understands both the right time and the right way.
21:8:6/Because there is a right time and way for everything, the suffering of humanity is great.
21:8:7/For no one knows what will happen: for who can tell them when it will happen?
21:8:8/No one has control over their spirit to keep the spirit; nor do they have control over the day of death: and there is no escape in that battle; nor will wrongdoing save those committed to it.
21:8:9/All this I have seen, and I have given my heart to every deed that is done under the sun: there is a time when one person rules over another to their detriment.
21:8:10/And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the holy place, and they were forgotten in the city where they had done so: this too is meaningless.
21:8:11/Because punishment for a wrong deed is not carried out quickly, the hearts of people are fully set on doing evil.
21:8:12/Even though a sinner does wrong a hundred times and lives a long life, I am sure it will go well with those who fear God, who show reverence before him:
21:8:13/But it will not go well for the wicked, nor will their days be extended, which are like a shadow; because they do not fear God.
21:8:14/There is a meaningless occurrence on earth; there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked people who get what the righteous deserve: I said that this too is meaningless.
21:8:15/Then I praised joy, because there is nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be joyful: for this will accompany them in their toil throughout the days of their life, which God gives them under the sun.
21:8:16/When I dedicated myself to understand wisdom and to observe the activity done on earth: (even though some never see sleep day or night:)
21:8:17/Then I saw all the work of God, that no one can comprehend what happens under the sun: despite their efforts to search it out, they will not find it; and even if a wise person thinks they can understand it, they will not be able to grasp it.
21:9:1/For all this I thought deeply in my heart to declare that the righteous, the wise, and their actions are in God's control: no one can truly understand love or hatred by everything that is apparent to them.
21:9:2/Everything happens similarly to everyone: the same fate befalls the righteous and the wicked, the pure and the impure, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. Just as it is with the good, so it is with the sinner; and the one who makes vows is like the one who is afraid to make them.
21:9:3/This is a tragedy among all things that happen under the sun, that everyone shares the same fate: moreover, people's hearts are full of evil, and madness fills their hearts during their lives, and afterwards, they join the dead.
21:9:4/For anyone who is connected to the living there is hope: for a living dog is better off than a dead lion.
21:9:5/For the living are aware that they will die: but the dead know nothing, nor do they have any more rewards; for their memory is forgotten.
21:9:6/Also, their love, their hatred, and their jealousy have now vanished; they no longer have any share in anything that happens under the sun.
21:9:7/Go ahead, eat your bread with happiness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart; for God now approves of your deeds.
21:9:8/Always wear clean clothes; and make sure your head is never without oil.
21:9:9/Enjoy life with the spouse you love all the days of your fleeting life, which God has given you under the sun—all your fleeting days: for this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.
21:9:10/Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your strength; for there is no activity, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave where you are heading.
21:9:11/I observed and saw under the sun that the race is not always won by the swift, nor the battle by the strong, nor does food always come to the wise, nor wealth to the intelligent, nor favor to the knowledgeable; but time and chance happen to them all.
21:9:12/For people do not know their time: like fish caught in a cruel net, and birds trapped in a snare, so are humans ensnared at an unfortunate time when it suddenly falls upon them.
21:9:13/This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it seemed significant to me: 
21:9:14/There was a small city with few people in it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built huge siege works against it.
21:9:15/But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom saved the city; yet no one remembered that poor man afterward.
21:9:16/Then I said, Wisdom is better than strength: but the poor man's wisdom is ignored, and his words are not heeded.
21:9:17/The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler among fools.
21:9:18/Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much that is good.
21:10:1/Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness outweighs wisdom and honor.
21:10:2/A wise person's heart guides them correctly, but a fool's heart leads them astray.
21:10:3/Indeed, when a fool walks down the road, they lack sense and show everyone that they are a fool.
21:10:4/If a ruler becomes angry with you, don't leave your post; calmness can defuse major conflicts.
21:10:5/There's a problem I've observed: mistakes made by those in power.
21:10:6/Foolishness is often treated with respect, while the wealthy are looked down upon.
21:10:7/I've seen servants on horseback while princes walk on foot like servants.
21:10:8/Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; if someone breaks through a wall, a snake will bite them.
21:10:9/Anyone who moves stones may be injured by them; and someone who splits logs may be endangered by the task.
21:10:10/If the axe is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but skill will bring success.
21:10:11/A snake will bite if it's not charmed; a gossip is no different.
21:10:12/The words from a wise person's mouth are gracious, but a fool's lips will swallow them up.
21:10:13/The beginning of their talk is foolishness, and the end of their speech is dangerous madness.
21:10:14/A fool is full of words; no one knows what will happen, and who can tell them what will happen after them?
21:10:15/The work of fools is exhausting to them because they don't know how to go to the city.
21:10:16/Woe to you, O land, when your king is inexperienced, and your leaders feast in the morning!
21:10:17/Blessed are you, O land, when your king is of noble birth, and your leaders eat at appropriate times for strength, not for drunkenness!
21:10:18/Through laziness, the rafters sag; because of idle hands, the house leaks.
21:10:19/A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.
21:10:20/Do not curse the king, even in your thoughts; do not curse the wealthy in your bedroom, for a bird may carry your voice, or some winged creature may report your words.
21:11:1/Share your resources freely, for you will reap the benefits in time.
21:11:2/Be generous to many, not knowing when you might face hardship.
21:11:3/When clouds are heavy, they release rain upon the earth; and wherever a tree falls, north or south, there it lies.
21:11:4/Those who wait for perfect conditions will never get anything done.
21:11:5/Just as you can't predict the path of the wind or how a baby forms in the womb, you cannot understand the works of God who does everything.
21:11:6/Plant your seeds in the morning and keep working until evening, because you don't know which efforts will succeed, if any, or if both will be equally good.
21:11:7/Indeed, light is delightful, and it's wonderful for the eyes to see the sun.
21:11:8/But even if a person lives many years and enjoys them all, they should remember the dark days, for there will be many. Everything to come is uncertain.
21:11:9/Enjoy your youth, young person; let your heart be happy while you're young. Follow the desires of your heart and what you see with your eyes, but remember that God will judge all these things.
21:11:10/So, rid your heart of sorrow and keep your body from harm, for childhood and youth are fleeting.
21:12:1/Remember your Creator in your youth, before the difficult days arrive and the years approach when you'll say, "I find no joy in them."
21:12:2/Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars grow dark, and the clouds come back after the rain.
21:12:3/When the guardians of the house tremble, the strong men stoop, the women grinding grain stop because they are few, and those looking through the windows see dimly.
21:12:4/When the street doors are closed, the sound of the mill fades, one wakes up at the chirp of a bird, and all the singers grow faint.
21:12:5/Also, when people fear heights and dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire no longer stirs, because people are going to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
21:12:6/Before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well.
21:12:7/Then the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
21:12:8/"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"
21:12:9/Moreover, because the teacher was wise, he continually shared knowledge with the people. He pondered, searched out, and arranged many proverbs.
21:12:10/The teacher sought to find delightful sayings and write down truthful words accurately.
21:12:11/The words of the wise prod us like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings given by one shepherd.
21:12:12/And further, my child, be warned: there is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body.
21:12:13/Here's the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the entirety of everyone's duty.
21:12:14/For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
22:1:1/The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
22:1:2/Let him kiss me with the passion of his lips: for your love is more delightful than wine.
22:1:3/Because of the fragrance of your fine perfumes your name is like perfume poured out, no wonder the young women love you.
22:1:4/Draw me after you; let's run together. The king has brought me into his private rooms: we will celebrate and delight in you, we will cherish your love more than wine: the upright adore you.
22:1:5/I am dark but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the pavilions of Solomon.
22:1:6/Do not stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has tanned me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.
22:1:7/Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?
22:1:8/If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.
22:1:9/I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
22:1:10/Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
22:1:11/We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.
22:1:12/While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
22:1:13/My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
22:1:14/My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of Engedi.
22:1:15/How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are like doves.
22:1:16/How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.
22:1:17/The beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.
22:2:1/I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
22:2:2/Just as a lily stands out among thorns, so does my love stand out among the women.
22:2:3/Like an apple tree among the forest trees, so is my beloved among the men. I eagerly sat in his shade, finding his fruit sweet to my taste.
22:2:4/He led me to the banquet hall, where his love for me was the flag flying high.
22:2:5/Support me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am overwhelmed with love.
22:2:6/His left hand cradles my head, while his right hand embraces me.
22:2:7/I urge you, O women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the does of the field, do not disturb or awaken love until it so desires.
22:2:8/The sound of my beloved! Look, here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22:2:9/My beloved is swift and graceful as a gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
22:2:10/My beloved spoke and said to me, "Get up, my love, my beautiful one, and come with me.
22:2:11/See, the winter is over, the rains have come and gone.
22:2:12/Flowers are appearing on the earth; the season for singing has come, and the cooing of doves is heard in our land.
22:2:13/The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Get up, my love, my beautiful one, and come with me."
22:2:14/Oh my dove, hidden in the cliffs of the rock, in the secret recesses of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22:2:15/Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.
22:2:16/My beloved belongs to me, and I belong to him; he browses among the lilies.
22:2:17/Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the rugged hills.
22:3:1/At night on my bed, I searched for the one my soul loves: I searched for him, but I didn't find him.
22:3:2/I'll get up now, and walk around the city, in the streets and wide avenues, I'll look for the one my soul loves: I looked for him, but I didn't find him.
22:3:3/The watchmen roaming the city found me: I asked them, "Have you seen the one my soul loves?"
22:3:4/It was only a short while after I left them, that I found the one my soul loves: I held onto him and wouldn't let him go, until I had brought him to my mother's house, to the room of the one who gave birth to me.
22:3:5/I urge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the does of the field, not to stir or awaken my love until he desires.
22:3:6/Who is this coming from the wilderness like columns of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense, and all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
22:3:7/Look, it's Solomon's bed; sixty mighty men surround it, from the mighty men of Israel.
22:3:8/They all wield swords, skilled in warfare: each man has his sword at his side, because of fears at night.
22:3:9/King Solomon made himself a carriage from the cedars of Lebanon.
22:3:10/He made its pillars of silver, its base of gold, its covering of purple, its interior lovingly inlaid by the daughters of Jerusalem.
22:3:11/Come out, O daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him on his wedding day, on the joyful day of his heart.
22:4:1/Look at you, so beautiful, my love; truly, you are beautiful. Your eyes behind your veil are like doves; your hair cascades like a herd of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.
22:4:2/Your teeth are as smooth and white as a flock of sheep freshly trimmed, coming up from being washed; each has its twin, and not one is missing.
22:4:3/Your lips are like a ribbon of scarlet, and your words are lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
22:4:4/Your neck is as majestic as the tower of David, built to display a thousand shields, all the armor of warriors.
22:4:5/Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, grazing among the lilies.
22:4:6/Until the day breaks and the shadows disappear, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense.
22:4:7/You are completely beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.
22:4:8/Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.
22:4:9/You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22:4:10/How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than any spice!
22:4:11/Your lips, my bride, drip with honey; honey and milk are under your tongue; the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22:4:12/You are a private garden, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.
22:4:13/Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard,
22:4:14/Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree, with myrrh and aloes, and all the finest spices.
22:4:15/You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.
22:4:16/Awake, north wind; and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread everywhere. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choice fruits.
22:5:1/I've entered my garden, my sister, my partner: I've collected my myrrh and my spices; I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I've drunk my wine with my milk: eat, friends; drink, yes, drink deeply, beloved.
22:5:2/I'm asleep, but my heart is awake: it's the voice of my beloved knocking, saying, "Open for me, my sister, my love, my dove, my flawless one: for my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night."
22:5:3/I've taken off my robe; how can I put it on again? I've washed my feet; how can I soil them?
22:5:4/My beloved reached in through the latch-opening, and my heart stirred for him.
22:5:5/I got up to open for my beloved; and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.
22:5:6/I opened for my beloved; but my beloved had left, he was gone: my heart sank at his departure: I looked for him, but did not find him; I called him, but he did not answer.
22:5:7/The watchmen who patrolled the city found me, they beat me, they injured me; the guards of the walls took my veil from me.
22:5:8/I urge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, tell him I am lovesick.
22:5:9/What makes your beloved better than another, O most beautiful among women? What makes your beloved better than another, that you so adjure us?
22:5:10/My beloved is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.
22:5:11/His head is the finest gold, his hair is wavy, and black as a raven.
22:5:12/His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk, and perfectly set.
22:5:13/His cheeks are like beds of spices, mounds of sweet-smelling herbs. His lips are like lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh.
22:5:14/His arms are rods of gold set with beryl. His body is like polished ivory decorated with sapphires.
22:5:15/His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
22:5:16/His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved, this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
22:6:1/Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned so we can help you find him?
22:6:2/My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
22:6:3/I belong to my beloved, and my beloved belongs to me: he feeds among the lilies.
22:6:4/You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awe-inspiring as an army with banners.
22:6:5/Look away from me, for your eyes have overwhelmed me: your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.
22:6:6/Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just washed, each bearing twins, and none among them is barren.
22:6:7/Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
22:6:8/There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and countless virgins.
22:6:9/My dove, my perfect one, is unique; she is the only one of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The daughters saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.
22:6:10/Who is she that shines forth like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awe-inspiring as an army with banners?
22:6:11/I went down to the nut garden to see the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded and the pomegranates were in bloom.
22:6:12/Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
22:6:13/Come back, come back, O Shulamite; come back, come back, that we may gaze at you. Why should you gaze at the Shulamite, as at the dance of two armies?
22:7:1/Your feet look so beautiful in sandals, O daughter of a prince! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, crafted by skilled hands.
22:7:2/Your navel is like a round goblet that never lacks blended wine; your belly is like a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
22:7:3/Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22:7:4/Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes are like the fish pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
22:7:5/The hair on your head is like the royal tapestries of Mount Carmel, and your hair is like royal purple; the king is captivated by your tresses.
22:7:6/How beautiful and delightful you are, my love, with all your charms!
22:7:7/Your stature is like that of a palm tree, and your breasts like clusters of fruit.
22:7:8/I thought, "I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,
22:7:9/And your mouth like the best wine, flowing smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.
22:7:10/I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.
22:7:11/Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages.
22:7:12/Let's go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom—there I will give you my love.
22:7:13/The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my beloved.
22:8:1/I wish you were like a brother to me, one who nursed at my mother's breasts. If I found you outside, I could kiss you without anyone looking down on us.
22:8:2/I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house, where she would teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, from the juice of my pomegranate.
22:8:3/His left hand would be under my head, and his right hand would embrace me.
22:8:4/I urge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, not to disturb or awaken my love until he desires.
22:8:5/Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you; there your mother gave birth to you, there she who bore you gave birth.
22:8:6/Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, jealousy as relentless as the grave. Its flames are blazing flames, the fiercest of all.
22:8:7/Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned.
22:8:8/We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
22:8:9/If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver; if she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
22:8:10/I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus, I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.
22:8:11/Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he leased the vineyard to keepers; each was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
22:8:12/My own vineyard is before me. You, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.
22:8:13/You who dwell in the gardens, with companions listening for your voice, let me hear it.
22:8:14/Hurry, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
23:1:1/The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23:1:2/Listen, heavens, and pay attention, earth: for the LORD has spoken, "I have raised and cared for children, but they have rebelled against me."
23:1:3/Even an ox recognizes its owner, and a donkey knows where its master feeds it, but Israel doesn't recognize me; my people don't understand."
23:1:4/Oh, what a sinful nation, burdened with wrongdoing, offspring of evildoers, children who corrupt! They have abandoned the LORD, angered the Holy One of Israel, and turned their backs on him.
23:1:5/Why should you be punished any more? You only continue to rebel. The entire body is sick, and the whole heart is weak.
23:1:6/From head to toe, there's no health in it—only wounds, bruises, and infected sores that haven't been treated or bandaged or soothed with ointment.
23:1:7/Your country lies in ruins, your cities are burned down; foreigners devour your land in front of you, leaving it desolate, destroyed by outsiders.
23:1:8/And the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.
23:1:9/If the LORD Almighty hadn't left us some survivors, we would have been wiped out like Sodom, we would have been destroyed like Gomorrah.
23:1:10/Listen to the LORD's message, you rulers of Sodom; pay attention to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah.
23:1:11/"What's the point of all your sacrifices to me?" says the LORD. "I've had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed animals; I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.
23:1:12/When you come to meet me, who asked you to trample through my courts with your meaningless offerings?
23:1:13/Stop bringing worthless offerings; your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—I cannot stand iniquity mixed with celebration.
23:1:14/I hate your New Moons and your appointed festivals; they have become a burden to me, and I'm tired of bearing them.
23:1:15/When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.
23:1:16/Cleanse yourselves, make yourselves pure; remove your evil deeds from my sight. Stop doing wrong.
23:1:17/Learn to do right; seek justice, defend the oppressed, take up the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.
23:1:18/"Come now, let's settle this," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
23:1:19/If you are willing and obedient, you will enjoy the best of the land.
23:1:20/But if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23:1:21/How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her, but now murderers.
23:1:22/Your silver has become worthless, your choice wine diluted with water.
23:1:23/Your leaders are rebels, friends of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.
23:1:24/Therefore, the LORD, the LORD Almighty, the mighty One of Israel, declares, "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.
23:1:25/And I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.
23:1:26/I will restore your judges as in the days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward, you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."
23:1:27/Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.
23:1:28/But rebels and sinners will be destroyed together, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
23:1:29/You will be ashamed of the sacred oaks in which you delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
23:1:30/You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.
23:1:31/The mighty will become tinder, and their work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.
23:2:1/The message that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, received about Judah and Jerusalem.
23:2:2/In the future, the mountain where the LORD's temple stands will be the highest of all, towering above the hills. People from all nations will stream towards it.
23:2:3/Many will come and say, "Let's go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so we can walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
23:2:4/He will settle disputes for many nations and provide guidance for many peoples. They will turn their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
23:2:5/Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
23:2:6/You have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob, because they are filled with influences from the east, they practice divination like the Philistines, and they embrace foreign customs.
23:2:7/Their land is filled with silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is also full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.
23:2:8/Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.
23:2:9/So people of low and high status humble themselves, but do not forgive them.
23:2:10/Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty.
23:2:11/The proud looks of people will be brought low, the arrogance of everyone will be humbled, and the LORD alone will be exalted on that day.
23:2:12/For the day of the LORD Almighty will come against everyone who is proud and lofty, against everyone who is lifted up—and they will be brought low.
23:2:13/It will come against all the tall cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up, and against all the oaks of Bashan,
23:2:14/Against all the towering mountains and all the high hills,
23:2:15/Against every lofty tower and every fortified wall,
23:2:16/Against all the ships of Tarshish and all the beautiful craft.
23:2:17/The pride of humanity will be brought low and human arrogance humbled, and the LORD alone will be exalted on that day.
23:2:18/And the idols will completely vanish.
23:2:19/People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the terror of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
23:2:20/In that day people will throw away to the moles and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.
23:2:21/They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhangs of the cliffs from the terror of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
23:2:22/Stop trusting in mere humans, who have but a breath in their nostrils. Why hold them in esteem?
23:3:1/Indeed, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will remove from Jerusalem and from Judah all support and sustenance, the entire supply of bread and all the water.
23:3:2/The warrior, the soldier, the judge, the prophet, the wise, and the elder,
23:3:3/The commander of fifty, the respected figure, the advisor, the skilled craftsman, and the articulate speaker.
23:3:4/And I will appoint inexperienced youths as their leaders, and children will govern them.
23:3:5/And the people will oppress each other, neighbor against neighbor: the young will disrespect the old, and the dishonorable will rise against the respected.
23:3:6/When someone grabs his brother in his father's house and says, "You have clothes, you be our leader, take charge of this ruin,"
23:3:7/On that day he will protest, saying, "I can't help; I have neither food nor clothes in my house. Don't make me the leader of the people."
23:3:8/For Jerusalem is in ruins, and Judah has fallen: because their words and actions are against the LORD, provoking His glorious presence.
23:3:9/Their faces testify against them; they parade their sin like Sodom, not hiding it. Woe to them! For they bring trouble upon themselves.
23:3:10/Tell the righteous it will go well with them: they will enjoy the fruits of their actions.
23:3:11/Woe to the wicked! It will go badly for him: he will be repaid for what his hands have done.
23:3:12/My people are oppressed by children, and women rule over them. Oh my people, your leaders mislead you and disrupt your paths.
23:3:13/The LORD stands up to argue His case, and stands to judge the people.
23:3:14/The LORD will bring judgment upon the elders and leaders of His people: "You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
23:3:15/Why do you crush my people and grind the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
23:3:16/Furthermore, the LORD says, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud, walking with outstretched necks and seductive eyes, strutting as they go, making tinkling sounds with their feet:
23:3:17/Therefore, the LORD will afflict the heads of the daughters of Zion with scabs, and the LORD will expose their shame.
23:3:18/On that day, the Lord will strip away the finery of their ankle bracelets, headbands, crescent necklaces,
23:3:19/The chains, bracelets, and veils,
23:3:20/The headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, and amulets,
23:3:21/The rings and nose jewels,
23:3:22/The festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses,
23:3:23/The mirrors, linen garments, turbans, and veils.
23:3:24/And it will happen that, instead of fragrance, there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well-styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
23:3:25/Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.
23:3:26/And her gates will lament and mourn; deserted, she will sit on the ground.
23:4:1/And on that day, seven women will cling to one man, saying, "We will provide our own food and clothes; just let us carry your name to remove our disgrace."
23:4:2/On that day, the LORD's branch will be magnificent and splendid, and the earth's produce will be superb and attractive for those of Israel who have survived.
23:4:3/And it will happen that those who remain in Zion and in Jerusalem will be called holy, every one who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
23:4:4/When the Lord has cleansed the filth of Zion's daughters and rinsed out Jerusalem's bloodstains with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of fire.
23:4:5/And the LORD will create over every home on Mount Zion and over its gatherings, a cloud and smoke by day, and the glow of a blazing fire by night; for over all the splendor there will be a protective covering.
23:4:6/And there will be a shelter to provide shade from the daytime heat, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
23:5:1/Now I will sing for my beloved a song about his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
23:5:2/He protected it, cleared it of stones, and planted it with the best vines. He built a watchtower in the middle and carved out a winepress as well. He expected it to produce good grapes, but it only produced bad ones.
23:5:3/And now, residents of Jerusalem and people of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard.
23:5:4/What more could have been done for my vineyard that I haven't done? Why, when I expected it to produce good grapes, did it produce bad ones?
23:5:5/So now, let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.
23:5:6/I will make it a wasteland; it will not be pruned or tended, and briers and thorns will grow up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.
23:5:7/For the vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the nation of Israel, and the people of Judah are the vines he delighted in. He looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.
23:5:8/Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field until no space is left and they live alone in the land!
23:5:9/The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: Surely many houses will become desolate, large and beautiful ones without occupants.
23:5:10/Indeed, ten acres of vineyard will yield only a bath of wine, and a homer of seed will yield only an ephah of grain.
23:5:11/Woe to those who get up early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night until they are inflamed with wine.
23:5:12/They have harps and lyres at their banquets, pipes and timbrels and wine, but they disregard the deeds of the LORD and fail to see the work of his hands.
23:5:13/Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of honor will die from hunger and their masses parched with thirst.
23:5:14/Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses along with all their brawlers and revelers.
23:5:15/So people will be brought low and everyone humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.
23:5:16/But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will be proved holy by his righteous acts.
23:5:17/Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.
23:5:18/Woe to those who drag wickedness with cords of deceit, and sin as if with cart ropes.
23:5:19/They say, "Let God hurry; let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come so we may know it."
23:5:20/Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
23:5:21/Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.
23:5:22/Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,
23:5:23/Who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.
23:5:24/Therefore, as fire consumes stubble and as flame burns away chaff, their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23:5:25/Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; he has raised his hand against them and struck them down. The mountains quake, and their dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23:5:26/He will raise a banner for the distant nations and whistle for them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they will come quickly and swiftly.
23:5:27/None will grow tired or stumble among them; none will slumber or sleep; not a belt is loosened, not a sandal strap broken.
23:5:28/Their arrows are sharp, all their bows strung; their horses' hooves seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
23:5:29/Their roar is like that of a lion, they roar like young lions; they growl and seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.
23:5:30/In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, there is darkness and distress; even the light is darkened by the clouds.
23:6:1/In the year that King Uzziah died, I also saw the LORD seated on a throne, high and exalted, with His robe filling the temple.
23:6:2/Above Him stood seraphim, each with six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.
23:6:3/And one called to another, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is filled with His glory."
23:6:4/And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of the one who called out, and the temple was filled with smoke.
23:6:5/Then I said, "Woe is me! I am ruined; because I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."
23:6:6/Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
23:6:7/And he touched my mouth with it and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for."
23:6:8/Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" And I said, "Here I am. Send me."
23:6:9/And He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'Listen carefully, but do not understand; look closely, but do not perceive.'"
23:6:10/"Make the hearts of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
23:6:11/Then I asked, "For how long, Lord?" And He replied, "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitants, the houses are without people, and the land is utterly desolate,"
23:6:12/And the LORD has sent everyone far away, and the land is greatly abandoned.
23:6:13/But even then, a tenth will remain in it, and it will again be subject to burning, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is cut down. The holy seed will be its stump.
23:7:1/In the time of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem but failed to conquer it.
23:7:2/News reached the royal family of David: "Syria has allied with Ephraim." This news shook Ahaz and his people like wind shaking trees in a forest.
23:7:3/Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shearjashub, at the end of the upper pool's conduit on the fuller’s field road; 
23:7:4/And tell him, 'Stay calm and don't be afraid. Don't lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah.'
23:7:5/Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted your downfall, saying, 
23:7:6/'Let's attack Judah, stir up trouble, and install the son of Tabeal as king in the midst of it.'
23:7:7/But the Sovereign LORD says, 'This will not happen; it will not come to be.'
23:7:8/'The capital of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be shattered, no longer a nation.'
23:7:9/'The capital of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in faith, you will not stand at all.'
23:7:10/Furthermore, the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, 
23:7:11/'Ask for a sign from the LORD your God; let it be deep as the grave or high as the sky.'
23:7:12/But Ahaz said, 'I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.'
23:7:13/Then Isaiah said, 'Listen now, house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans, will you also try the patience of my God?'
23:7:14/Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: Look, a young woman will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
23:7:15/He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.
23:7:16/For before the boy knows how to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be deserted.
23:7:17/The LORD will bring on you, your people, and your father's house such days as have not come since Ephraim broke away from Judah—the king of Assyria is coming.
23:7:18/In that day, the LORD will whistle for the flies from the farthest streams of Egypt and for the bees from the land of Assyria.
23:7:19/They will all come and settle in the steep ravines, in the crevices of the rocks, on all the thornbushes, and at all the water holes.
23:7:20/On that day, the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave your head, the hair of your legs, and also to remove your beard.
23:7:21/In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two sheep; 
23:7:22/And because of the abundance of milk they give, everyone left in the land will eat curds and honey.
23:7:23/In that day, every place where there used to be a thousand vines worth a thousand silver coins, will be overrun with briers and thorns.
23:7:24/People will go there with bows and arrows because the whole land will be briers and thorns.
23:7:25/And all the hills that used to be cultivated with a hoe, you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become places where cattle are let loose and where sheep run.
23:8:1/Furthermore, the LORD said to me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with a regular pen about Mahershalalhashbaz."
23:8:2/So I called on trustworthy witnesses to document this, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
23:8:3/Then I approached the prophetess; she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The LORD then told me, "Name him Mahershalalhashbaz."
23:8:4/"Because before the boy knows how to say 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
23:8:5/The LORD spoke to me once more, saying,
23:8:6/"Since this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and delights in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
23:8:7/Now, therefore, the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the river—the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow all its channels and sweep over all its banks.
23:8:8/It will sweep through Judah, flooding and passing through, reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel."
23:8:9/"Band together, you peoples, and be shattered; listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered; prepare for battle, and be shattered."
23:8:10/"Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us."
23:8:11/For the LORD spoke to me forcefully and warned me not to follow the way of this people, saying,
23:8:12/"Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it."
23:8:13/"Regard the LORD of hosts as holy; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread."
23:8:14/"He will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stone to trip over and a rock to stumble against, a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
23:8:15/"Many among them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured."
23:8:16/"Preserve the testimony, seal up the law among my disciples."
23:8:17/"I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob, and I will put my hope in him."
23:8:18/"Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion."
23:8:19/"When people tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, shouldn't a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?"
23:8:20/"To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no dawn."
23:8:21/"They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God."
23:8:22/"Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness, fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness."
23:9:1/However, the darkness will not be as intense as it was in her time of distress, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and later on, he more severely afflicted her by the sea route, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
23:9:2/The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light: those who live in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shone.
23:9:3/You have increased the nation, but not their joy: they rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest time, and as men are glad when they divide the spoils.
23:9:4/For you have shattered the yoke of their burden, and the staff on their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
23:9:5/For every warrior's battle is with noisy confusion, and garments rolled in blood; but this will be with burning and fuel of fire.
23:9:6/For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government will be on his shoulders: and he will be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
23:9:7/The expansion of his government and peace will have no end, he will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.
23:9:8/The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it landed upon Israel.
23:9:9/And all the people will know, including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say with pride and arrogance of heart,
23:9:10/"The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars."
23:9:11/Therefore, the LORD will raise up the foes of Rezin against him and stir up his enemies,
23:9:12/The Syrians from the east and the Philistines from the west; and they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
23:9:13/For the people do not turn to him who strikes them, nor do they seek the LORD of hosts.
23:9:14/Therefore, the LORD will cut off from Israel both head and tail, branch and reed in a single day.
23:9:15/The elder and honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.
23:9:16/For the leaders of this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are swallowed up.
23:9:17/Therefore, the LORD will take no pleasure in their young men, nor will he have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
23:9:18/For wickedness burns like a fire; it will consume the briers and thorns, and will ignite the thickets of the forest, and they will billow upwards in columns of smoke.
23:9:19/Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts, the land is darkened, and the people will be like fuel for the fire; no one will spare his brother.
23:9:20/And one will grab on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied: they will eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
23:9:21/Manasseh against Ephraim; and Ephraim against Manasseh: and together they will be against Judah. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
23:10:1/Doom to those who make unjust laws, and those who write oppressive policies.
23:10:2/To push aside the needy from getting fair treatment, and to strip the rights from the poor of my people, making widows their victims, and robbing the orphans!
23:10:3/What will you do when judgment day comes, and devastation arrives from afar? To whom will you run for help? Where will you leave your riches?
23:10:4/Without me, they will surrender to the captives, and fall among the dead. Despite all this, his anger isn't turned away, but his hand is still extended.
23:10:5/O Assyrian, the instrument of my anger, and the one in whose hand I place my wrath.
23:10:6/I will send him against a nation of hypocrites, and against the people of my fury I will issue a command, to seize loot, to snatch prey, and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
23:10:7/However, he doesn't intend this, nor does his heart think this way; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off not just a few nations.
23:10:8/For he says, "Aren't all my commanders kings?"
23:10:9/"Isn't Calno like Carchemish? Isn't Hamath like Arpad? Isn't Samaria like Damascus?"
23:10:10/"As my hand has reached the kingdoms of the idols, whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria;
23:10:11/"Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?"
23:10:12/Therefore, when the Lord has completed his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the king of Assyria's proud heart, and the haughty look in his eyes.
23:10:13/For he says, "By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, because I am clever. I have removed the boundaries of nations, and plundered their treasures; like a mighty one, I have subdued the inhabitants.
23:10:14/"And my hand has found the wealth of the people as if it were a nest; and as one gathers abandoned eggs, I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing, or opened a mouth, or chirped."
23:10:15/Can the axe boast itself against the one who chops with it? Or can the saw exalt itself against the one who wields it? As if a rod could wield those who lift it, or as if a staff could lift up, as if it were not wood.
23:10:16/Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will send leanness among his stout warriors; and under his glory a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame.
23:10:17/And the Light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
23:10:18/And will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fertile field, both soul and body; and they will be as when a sick man wastes away.
23:10:19/And the remaining trees of his forest will be so few that a child could write them down.
23:10:20/And in that day, the survivors of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will no longer rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
23:10:21/The survivors will return, the survivors of Jacob, to the mighty God.
23:10:22/For though your people, Israel, may be like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous.
23:10:23/For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a determined end in the midst of all the land.
23:10:24/Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "O my people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian. He will strike you with a rod and lift up his staff against you, in the same way Egypt did.
23:10:25/For in a very little while, my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction."
23:10:26/And the LORD of hosts will wield a whip against him as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as his rod was over the sea, so he will lift it up in the manner of Egypt.
23:10:27/And in that day, his burden will be lifted from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
23:10:28/He has come to Aiath, he has passed through Migron; at Michmash he stores his supplies.
23:10:29/They have crossed over the pass; they have made their camp at Geba. Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled.
23:10:30/Shout aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! Poor Anathoth!
23:10:31/Madmenah is on the run; the inhabitants of Gebim are gathering to flee.
23:10:32/Yet today he will remain at Nob; he will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
23:10:33/Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will chop off the branches with terrifying power; the tall trees will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
23:10:34/He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
23:11:1/A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
23:11:2/The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him— the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.
23:11:3/He will delight in obeying the LORD. He won't judge by appearances or make decisions based on hearsay.
23:11:4/He will judge the needy with fairness and defend the rights of the oppressed. With just a word, he will strike down the earth, and with his command, the wicked will be destroyed.
23:11:5/Righteousness will be his belt, and faithfulness the sash around his waist.
23:11:6/Wolves will live with lambs, leopards will lie down with goats, calves, lions, and yearling animals will be together, and a little child will lead them.
23:11:7/Cows and bears will share pastures, their young will rest together, and lions will eat straw like oxen.
23:11:8/Infants will play near snake dens, and young children will put their hands into viper nests without harm.
23:11:9/No one will harm or destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
23:11:10/In that day, the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious.
23:11:11/On that day, the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea.
23:11:12/He will raise a flag for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will collect the scattered people of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
23:11:13/The jealousy of Ephraim will vanish, and the hostility of Judah will be removed. Ephraim won't be jealous of Judah, nor Judah hostile towards Ephraim.
23:11:14/They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines to the west; together they will plunder the people to the east. They will lay their hands on Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
23:11:15/The LORD will completely destroy the Gulf of the Egyptian Sea; with a scorching wind, he will shake his fist over the Euphrates River and strike it into seven streams so people can cross over in sandals.
23:11:16/There will be a highway for the remnant of his people left in Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from Egypt.
23:12:1/And on that day you will say, "O LORD, I will praise you. Even though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away, and you have comforted me."
23:12:2/"Look, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he has also become my salvation."
23:12:3/"Therefore, with joy, you will draw water from the springs of salvation."
23:12:4/"And on that day you will say, 'Praise the LORD, call upon his name, share his deeds among the people, highlight that his name is exalted.'"
23:12:5/"Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things; this is known throughout the earth."
23:12:6/"Shout aloud and sing for joy, you residents of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you."
23:13:1/The message about Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
23:13:2/Raise a flag on the high mountain, shout to them, wave your hand, so they may enter the gates of the nobles.
23:13:3/I have ordered my consecrated ones, I have also summoned my warriors for my anger, those who exult in my majesty.
23:13:4/The sound of a crowd in the mountains, like that of a large nation; a loud uproar of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts is assembling the army for battle.
23:13:5/They come from a distant land, from the farthest reaches of heaven, the LORD and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the entire land.
23:13:6/Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
23:13:7/Therefore, all hands will go limp, and every heart will melt.
23:13:8/They will be terrified: pain and anguish will seize them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame.
23:13:9/Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, cruel with fury and burning anger, to make the land desolate: and he will wipe out its sinners from it.
23:13:10/For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not shine their light: the sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will not shed its light.
23:13:11/And I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their sins; I will end the arrogance of the proud and humble the pride of the ruthless.
23:13:12/I will make humans more rare than fine gold, more scarce than the gold of Ophir.
23:13:13/Therefore, I will shake the heavens, and the earth will move from its place, at the wrath of the LORD of hosts, in the day of his burning anger.
23:13:14/It will be like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd: each will return to their own people, each will flee to their own land.
23:13:15/Whoever is found will be stabbed, and whoever is caught will fall by the sword.
23:13:16/Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted, and their wives violated.
23:13:17/Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not care for silver and will not delight in gold.
23:13:18/Their bows will dash the young men to pieces; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; their eyes will not spare children.
23:13:19/And Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the pride of the Chaldeans' splendor, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
23:13:20/It will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch a tent there, no shepherd will rest their flocks there.
23:13:21/But wild animals of the desert will lie there; their houses will be full of howling creatures; owls will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.
23:13:22/Wild animals will cry in its deserted houses, and dragons in the delightful palaces: and its time is near to come, and its days will not be extended.
23:14:1/For the LORD will show compassion to Jacob, and will still choose Israel, and will settle them in their own land. The foreigners will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
23:14:2/And the people will take them and bring them to their place. In the land of the LORD, the house of Israel will possess them as servants and maids. They will take captive those who had captured them and will rule over their oppressors.
23:14:3/And it will happen that on the day the LORD gives you relief from your suffering, fear, and the harsh labor you were forced to do,
23:14:4/You will mock the king of Babylon by saying, "How the oppressor has ended! The city of gold has ceased!"
23:14:5/The LORD has broken the rod of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers.
23:14:6/The one who struck the people in anger with unending blows, the one who ruled the nations in wrath, is pursued with no one to stop him.
23:14:7/The whole earth is at peace and quiet; they burst into song.
23:14:8/Indeed, the fir trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon say, "Since you were laid low, no woodcutter comes up against us."
23:14:9/The realm of the dead below is stirred up to meet you at your coming; it rouses the spirits of the dead to greet you—all the leaders of the earth; it makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones.
23:14:10/All of them will respond and say to you, "Have you also become weak as we are? Have you become like us?"
23:14:11/Your pomp is brought down to the grave, along with the sound of your harps. Maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you.
23:14:12/How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the ground, you who once laid low the nations!
23:14:13/You said in your heart, "I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon.
23:14:14/I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High."
23:14:15/But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.
23:14:16/Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: "Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble,
23:14:17/the one who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?"
23:14:18/All the kings of the nations lie in honor, each in his own tomb.
23:14:19/But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot,
23:14:20/you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again.
23:14:21/Prepare a place to slaughter his children for the sins of their ancestors; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.
23:14:22/I will rise up against them, says the LORD of hosts, and will cut off from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and descendants, says the LORD.
23:14:23/I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the LORD of hosts.
23:14:24/The LORD of hosts has sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand:
23:14:25/that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains trample him underfoot. Then his yoke will be removed from them, and his burden removed from their shoulders.
23:14:26/This is the plan determined for the whole earth; and this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
23:14:27/For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?"
23:14:28/In the year that King Ahaz died, this prophecy was given.
23:14:29/Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken. From the serpent's root, a viper will emerge, and its fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.
23:14:30/The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But I will kill your root with famine; it will slay your survivors.
23:14:31/Wail, O gate; cry out, O city; melt away, all Philistia. For smoke comes from the north, and there is no straggler in its ranks.
23:14:32/What will one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD has founded Zion, and the poor of his people will find refuge in it.
23:15:1/The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is destroyed, and silenced; because in the night Kir of Moab is destroyed, and silenced;
23:15:2/He has gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab will mourn over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads will be baldness, and every beard shaved off.
23:15:3/In their streets they will wear sackcloth: on the rooftops of their houses, and in their streets, everyone will mourn, weeping profusely.
23:15:4/And Heshbon will cry out, and Elealeh: their voice will be heard even to Jahaz: therefore the soldiers of Moab will cry out; his life will be filled with anguish.
23:15:5/My heart will cry out for Moab; his refugees will flee to Zoar, a heifer of three years old: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they will go up; for on the road to Horonaim they will raise a cry of destruction.
23:15:6/For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate: for the hay has withered away, the grass fails, there is no green thing.
23:15:7/Therefore the wealth they have gained, and what they have stored, will be carried away to the brook of the willows.
23:15:8/For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab; the wailing reaches Eglaim, and the wailing to Beerelim.
23:15:9/For the waters of Dimon will be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon those who escape from Moab, and upon the survivors of the land.
23:16:1/Send the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela through the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
23:16:2/It will be like a bird that wanders from its nest; so will the daughters of Moab be at the crossing places of Arnon.
23:16:3/Make plans, carry out justice; make your protection as dark as night in the middle of the day; shelter those who have no home; do not betray the one who wanders.
23:16:4/Let my displaced people stay with you, Moab; be their refuge from the attacker: for the extortioner is no more, the destroyer has stopped, the oppressors have vanished from the land.
23:16:5/And through mercy, the throne will be established: and he will sit on it faithfully in the tent of David, governing, seeking justice, and quickly bringing about righteousness.
23:16:6/We have heard about Moab's arrogance; he is extremely proud: his arrogance, his pride, and his anger are well known: but his boasts will not stand.
23:16:7/Therefore, Moab will wail for Moab, everyone will mourn: for the ruins of Kirhareseth you will grieve; indeed, they are devastated.
23:16:8/The fields of Heshbon wither, and the vines of Sibmah: the rulers of the nations have destroyed its choice vines, they have reached even to Jazer, they wandered through the desert: its shoots spread out, they crossed over the sea.
23:16:9/Therefore, I will mourn for the vines of Sibmah with the weeping of Jazer: I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh: for the cries over your summer fruits and harvest have fallen silent.
23:16:10/And joy and gladness are taken from the fertile field; in the vineyards, there will be no songs or cheers: the treaders will not press wine in their presses; I have ended the shouts of joy at harvest time.
23:16:11/Therefore, my heart will moan like a harp for Moab, and my inner being for Kirharesh.
23:16:12/And it will happen, when it is seen that Moab is exhausted on the high place, he will enter his sanctuary to pray; but he will not succeed.
23:16:13/This is the message that the LORD has previously declared about Moab.
23:16:14/But now the LORD has declared, saying, Within three years, as a hired worker counts years, the glory of Moab will be despised, with all its great multitude; and the survivors will be very few and weak.
23:17:1/Damascus is doomed. It will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins.
23:17:2/The towns of Aroer will be deserted. They will become places where flocks lie down without fear.
23:17:3/The stronghold will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus. The remnants of Syria will share the fate of Israel's glory, says the LORD Almighty.
23:17:4/On that day, Jacob's glory will fade, and his healthy body will waste away.
23:17:5/It will be like when a harvester collects the wheat and cuts the ears with his arm; it will be like someone gathering ears of corn in the Valley of Rephaim.
23:17:6/Some grapes will be left behind, like when an olive tree is shaken—two or three olives at the very top, four or five on the fruitful branches, declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
23:17:7/At that time, people will turn to their Maker and look to the Holy One of Israel.
23:17:8/They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will not consider what their fingers have made, neither the Asherah poles nor the incense altars.
23:17:9/On that day, their strong cities will be like abandoned places in the forest, left because of the Israelites; there will be desolation.
23:17:10/Because you have forgotten the God who saves you and have not remembered the Rock, your fortress, you plant delightful plants and set them with foreign vines.
23:17:11/You may make your plants grow on the day you plant them and make your seedlings flourish in the morning, but the harvest will vanish on the day of disease and incurable pain.
23:17:12/Woe to the many peoples who roar like the roaring of the seas, and to the nations that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!
23:17:13/The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters, but God will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, chased like chaff on the hills before the wind, like tumbleweed before the storm.
23:17:14/And in the evening, sudden terror; before morning, they are gone. This is the fate of those who plunder us, the lot of those who rob us.
23:18:1/Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:
23:18:2/That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people formidable from their beginning until now; a nation measured out and trampled down, whose land the rivers have ruined!
23:18:3/All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see when he raises a flag on the mountains; and when he blows a trumpet, listen.
23:18:4/For so the LORD said to me, I will take my rest, and I will look from my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
23:18:5/For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.
23:18:6/They shall be left together for the birds of the mountains, and for the beasts of the earth: and the birds shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.
23:18:7/In that time a gift will be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people scattered and peeled, and from a people formidable from their beginning until now; a nation measured out and trampled underfoot, whose land the rivers have ruined, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, Mount Zion.
23:19:1/The message about Egypt. Look, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.
23:19:2/I will incite Egyptians against each other—brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
23:19:3/The spirit of Egypt will fail within it, and I will demolish its plans. They will resort to idols, enchanters, mediums, and sorcerers for guidance.
23:19:4/I will hand the Egyptians over to a harsh ruler; a fierce king will dominate them, declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
23:19:5/The waters will vanish from the sea, and the river will be parched and dry.
23:19:6/The rivers will turn away; the streams of defense will be drained and dry. The reeds and rushes will wither.
23:19:7/The plants by the streams, at the mouth of the streams, and all the sown fields by the streams will dry up, be blown away, and disappear.
23:19:8/The fishermen will grieve, all who cast hooks into the streams will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.
23:19:9/Those who work with fine flax and weave intricate fabrics will be dismayed.
23:19:10/Those who build dams and fish ponds will be shattered in their endeavors.
23:19:11/Indeed, the leaders of Zoan are foolish; Pharaoh's wise advisors give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am a descendant of the wise, a descendant of ancient kings"?
23:19:12/Where are they now? Where are your wise men? Let them tell you now; let them know what the LORD Almighty has planned against Egypt.
23:19:13/The leaders of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Noph are deceived; they have led Egypt astray, those who were its cornerstone.
23:19:14/The LORD has infused a spirit of distortion within it; they have led Egypt astray in all its actions, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
23:19:15/There will be no work for Egypt that head or tail, palm branch or reed, can do.
23:19:16/On that day, Egypt will be like women, terrified and trembling because of the LORD Almighty's waving hand against it.
23:19:17/The land of Judah will become a source of terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it will be terrified because of the plan of the LORD Almighty, which he has determined against it.
23:19:18/On that day, five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty; one will be called the City of Destruction.
23:19:19/On that day, there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border.
23:19:20/It will serve as a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, who will rescue them.
23:19:21/And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and on that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them.
23:19:22/The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
23:19:23/On that day, there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
23:19:24/On that day, Israel will be one of three with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth.
23:19:25/Whom the LORD Almighty will bless, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance."
23:20:1/In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and captured it;
23:20:2/At that time, the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and remove the sackcloth from your waist, and take off your shoe from your foot." And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
23:20:3/And the LORD said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia;
23:20:4/In the same way, the king of Assyria will lead away the Egyptians as prisoners and the Ethiopians as captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks exposed, to Egypt's humiliation.
23:20:5/And they will be terrified and ashamed because of Ethiopia their hope, and Egypt their pride.
23:20:6/And the people of this island will say on that day, 'Look, this is what we hoped for, to whom we ran for help to be rescued from the king of Assyria: and how can we escape?'
23:21:1/The message concerning the desert by the sea. Like storms passing through the south, it comes from the desert, from a land of terror.
23:21:2/A distressing vision has been shown to me; the betrayer betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Advance, O Elam; besiege, O Media; I have put an end to all their groaning.
23:21:3/Therefore, my body is filled with pain; I am seized by agony, like the agony of childbirth: I was bent over when I heard it; I was horrified when I saw it.
23:21:4/My heart races, terror overwhelms me; the night that was meant for joy has turned into fear for me.
23:21:5/Set the table, keep watch from the watchtower, eat, drink: get up, you leaders, and prepare for battle.
23:21:6/For this is what the LORD says to me, "Go, post a lookout and let him report what he sees.
23:21:7/And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, a chariot of donkeys, and a chariot of camels; and he paid close attention, very carefully: 
23:21:8/And he shouted, 'A lion!' 'My lord, I stand constantly on the watchtower during the day, and I am stationed at my guard post every night: 
23:21:9/And look, here comes a chariot of men, with a pair of horsemen. And he replied and said, 'Babylon has fallen, has fallen; and all the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground.'
23:21:10/O my threshed people, and the grain of my threshing floor: what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I have told you.
23:21:11/The message concerning Dumah. Someone calls to me from Seir, 'Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?'
23:21:12/The watchman says, 'Morning is coming, but also the night: if you want to ask, then ask; come back again.'
23:21:13/The message concerning Arabia. In the thickets in Arabia you will camp, O caravans of Dedanites.
23:21:14/The people of the land of Tema brought water to the thirsty, they greeted the fugitives with food.
23:21:15/For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the harshness of battle.
23:21:16/For this is what the LORD says to me, "Within a year, as a hired worker counts the year, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end;
23:21:17/And the remaining number of archers, the warriors of the people of Kedar, will be reduced: for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken it.
23:22:1/The message concerning the valley of vision. What's wrong with you now, that you've all rushed to the rooftops?
23:22:2/You, bustling and chaotic city, full of joy: your fallen are not killed by the sword, nor have they died in battle.
23:22:3/All your leaders have fled together, they are captured by the archers: everyone found in you is captured, having fled from afar.
23:22:4/That's why I said, "Turn away from me; I will weep bitterly, do not try to comfort me, because of the devastation of my people."
23:22:5/For it is a day of trouble, of trampling, and of confusion by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down walls, and of crying out to the mountains.
23:22:6/And Elam carried the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir exposed the shield.
23:22:7/It will happen that your best valleys will be filled with chariots, and horsemen will take their positions at the gate.
23:22:8/And the defenses of Judah were exposed, and on that day you looked to the weapons in the house of the forest.
23:22:9/You also saw the breaches in the city of David, that they were many: and you collected the waters of the lower pool.
23:22:10/You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.
23:22:11/You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but you did not look to its Maker, nor did you regard the One who planned it long ago.
23:22:12/And on that day the Lord GOD of hosts called for weeping, for mourning, for shaving heads, and for wearing sackcloth.
23:22:13/Yet there was joy and gladness, slaughtering oxen, and killing sheep, eating meat, and drinking wine: "Let's eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die."
23:22:14/And it was revealed to me by the LORD of hosts, "Surely this sin will not be forgiven you until you die," says the Lord GOD of hosts.
23:22:15/This is what the Lord GOD of hosts says, "Go to this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the palace, and say,
23:22:16/'What right do you have here? Who do you have here, that you have carved out a tomb for yourself here, as one who carves a tomb on high, who carves a dwelling for himself in the rock?'
23:22:17/Behold, the LORD will throw you away with great force, and will surely cover you.
23:22:18/He will surely toss you around and throw you like a ball into a wide land: there you will die, and there your splendid chariots will bring shame to your master's house.
23:22:19/And I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your position.
23:22:20/And it will happen on that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah,
23:22:21/And I will dress him in your robe, strengthen him with your belt, and I will entrust your authority to his hand: and he will be a father to the residents of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
23:22:22/And I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; he will open, and no one will shut; and he will shut, and no one will open.
23:22:23/And I will secure him as a peg in a firm place; and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house.
23:22:24/And on him will hang all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the descendants, all small vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.
23:22:25/On that day, says the LORD of hosts, the peg that was secured in a firm place will be removed, cut down, and fall; and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken it.
23:23:1/The message about Tyre. Cry out, you ships of Tarshish; for it is destroyed, so that there is no house, no entry: from the land of Chittim it is made known to them.
23:23:2/Be silent, you people of the island; you whom the merchants of Sidon, who cross the sea, have filled.
23:23:3/And through vast waters the grain of the Nile, the harvest of the river, is her income; and she has become a marketplace for nations.
23:23:4/Feel shame, O Sidon: for the sea has spoken, even the might of the sea, saying, I do not labor, nor give birth, neither do I raise young men, nor bring up young women.
23:23:5/Just as the news about Egypt, so they will be in agony at the news of Tyre.
23:23:6/Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.
23:23:7/Is this your jubilant city, whose origin is from ancient times? her own feet will carry her far away to live.
23:23:8/Who has planned this against Tyre, the crown jewel, whose merchants are like royalty, whose traders are the nobles of the earth?
23:23:9/The LORD of hosts has planned it, to tarnish the pride of all glory, and to disgrace all the nobles of the earth.
23:23:10/Move through your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more power.
23:23:11/He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD has issued a command against the merchant city, to destroy its fortresses.
23:23:12/And he said, You will no longer rejoice, O you oppressed virgin, daughter of Sidon: arise, cross over to Chittim; there too you will find no rest.
23:23:13/See the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, until the Assyrian established it for those who live in the desert: they set up its towers, they raised up its palaces; and he brought it to ruin.
23:23:14/Cry out, you ships of Tarshish: for your stronghold is destroyed.
23:23:15/And it will happen in that day, that Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king: after the end of seventy years, Tyre will return to her ways like a prostitute.
23:23:16/Grab a harp, wander through the city, you forgotten prostitute; play sweetly, sing many songs, so that you may be remembered.
23:23:17/And it will happen after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her earnings, and will engage in promiscuous trade with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
23:23:18/And her profits and her earnings will be dedicated to the LORD: they will not be stored or hoarded; for her profits will provide for those who live in the presence of the LORD, to eat abundantly, and for lasting clothing.
23:24:1/Behold, the LORD will make the earth empty, destroy it, turn it upside down, and scatter its inhabitants.
23:24:2/It will be the same for everyone: priest and people, servant and master, maid and mistress, buyer and seller, lender and borrower, creditor and debtor.
23:24:3/The land will be completely emptied and utterly plundered, for the LORD has spoken this word.
23:24:4/The earth mourns and withers, the world fades and withers, the proud people of the earth fade away.
23:24:5/The earth is polluted by its inhabitants; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.
23:24:6/Therefore, a curse consumes the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt. Therefore, the earth's inhabitants are burned, and few people are left.
23:24:7/The new wine mourns, the vine withers, all the merry-hearted sigh.
23:24:8/The joy of tambourines is stilled, the noise of revelers has ended, the joy of the harp is stilled.
23:24:9/They no longer drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
23:24:10/The city of chaos is broken down; every house is closed up so that no one can enter.
23:24:11/There is an outcry in the streets for wine; all joy turns to gloom, the gladness of the earth is banished.
23:24:12/Desolation is left in the city, and the gate is battered to ruins.
23:24:13/When it shall be thus in the midst of the land among the people, it will be like the shaking of an olive tree, like the gleaning when the grape harvest is done.
23:24:14/They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; they shout from the west concerning the majesty of the LORD.
23:24:15/Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea, give glory to the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
23:24:16/From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. But I say, "I waste away, I waste away. Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery, the treacherous betray!"
23:24:17/Terror, and the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.
23:24:18/Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. For the windows on high are open, and the earth's foundations tremble.
23:24:19/The earth is completely broken down, the earth is split apart, the earth is violently shaken.
23:24:20/The earth staggers like a drunkard, it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it will fall, never to rise again.
23:24:21/On that day the LORD will punish the heavenly forces in the heavens and the kings of the earth on the earth.
23:24:22/They will be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.
23:24:23/Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, for the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders, with glorious splendor.
23:25:1/O Lord, you are my God; I will lift you up high, I will praise your name; for you have accomplished amazing things; your plans from long ago are reliable and true.
23:25:2/For you have turned a city into rubble; a fortified city into ruins: a palace of foreigners to be no more, it will never be rebuilt.
23:25:3/Therefore, the mighty people will honor you, the city of fearsome nations will fear you.
23:25:4/For you have been a support to the poor, a support to the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the fury of the fearsome ones is like a storm against a wall.
23:25:5/You will silence the uproar of foreigners, like heat in a parched land; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the power of the fearsome ones will be humbled.
23:25:6/And on this mountain, the LORD of hosts will prepare for all people a feast of rich food, a feast of aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined.
23:25:7/And he will eliminate on this mountain the shroud that covers all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations.
23:25:8/He will put an end to death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces; and the disgrace of his people he will remove from the whole earth: for the LORD has declared it.
23:25:9/And it will be said on that day, Look, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be joyful and rejoice in his salvation.
23:25:10/For on this mountain the hand of the LORD will rest, and Moab will be trampled under him, just as straw is trampled down in the manure.
23:25:11/And he will spread out his hands among them, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim: and he will bring down their pride together with the treasures of their hands.
23:25:12/And the fortress of the high fort of your walls he will bring down, make low, and bring to the ground, down to the dust.
23:26:1/On that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; God will set up salvation as its walls and defenses.
23:26:2/Open the gates, so the righteous nation that remains faithful can enter.
23:26:3/You will keep in perfect peace the one whose mind is focused on you, because they trust in you.
23:26:4/Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD GOD is an eternal rock.
23:26:5/For he brings down those who live in high places; the lofty city, he humbles it, he humbles it to the ground, he brings it down to the dust.
23:26:6/The foot will trample it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.
23:26:7/The path of the righteous is straight; you, the most upright, level the way of the righteous.
23:26:8/Indeed, in the path of your judgments, O LORD, we have waited for you; our soul's desire is for your name and remembrance.
23:26:9/With my soul, I have desired you in the night; indeed, with my spirit within me, I will seek you early; for when your judgments are on the earth, the world's inhabitants learn righteousness.
23:26:10/Even if favor is shown to the wicked, he does not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness, he acts unjustly and does not see the majesty of the LORD.
23:26:11/LORD, when your hand is lifted up, they do not see it. But they will see and be ashamed of their envy at the people; indeed, the fire reserved for your enemies will consume them.
23:26:12/LORD, you will establish peace for us, for you have also performed all our works for us.
23:26:13/O LORD our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but we acknowledge only your name.
23:26:14/They are dead, they will not live; they are ghosts, they will not rise; therefore, you have punished and destroyed them, and wiped out all memory of them.
23:26:15/You have enlarged the nation, O LORD, you have enlarged the nation; you are glorified; you have extended all the borders of the land.
23:26:16/LORD, in distress they sought you, they poured out a whispered prayer when your discipline was upon them.
23:26:17/Like a pregnant woman who writhes and cries out in her pains when she is near to giving birth, so were we in your presence, O LORD.
23:26:18/We were pregnant, we writhed, but we have given birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth, nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
23:26:19/Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead.
23:26:20/Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the fury has passed by.
23:26:21/For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth will also reveal her bloodshed and will no longer cover her slain.
23:27:1/On that day, the LORD with his severe, mighty, and strong sword will punish Leviathan, the piercing serpent, even Leviathan, the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon in the sea.
23:27:2/On that day, sing to her, "A vineyard of red wine."
23:27:3/I, the LORD, will protect it; I will water it every moment: so that no one harms it, I will guard it day and night.
23:27:4/I am not angry: who would dare to confront me with briers and thorns in battle? I would march right through them, I would burn them all.
23:27:5/Or let him grasp my strength, so that he may make peace with me; and he will make peace with me.
23:27:6/He will enable those who come from Jacob to take root: Israel will flourish and bloom, and cover the world with fruit.
23:27:7/Has he struck him as he struck those who struck him? Or has he been killed like those he has killed?
23:27:8/To some extent, when it sprouts, you will argue with it: he calms his fierce wind on the day of the east wind.
23:27:9/Through this, the wrongdoing of Jacob will be cleansed; and this is the full effect of removing his sin; when he turns all the altar stones to crushed chalk, the sacred poles and idols will no longer stand.
23:27:10/Yet the fortified city will be deserted, the dwelling abandoned and left like a wilderness: there the calf will graze, and there it will lie down, consuming its branches.
23:27:11/When its branches are dry, they will be broken off: women will come and set them on fire: for it is a people without understanding: therefore, their maker will not have mercy on them, and their creator will show them no favor.
23:27:12/And it will happen on that day, that the LORD will thresh from the flowing stream of the river to the brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.
23:27:13/And it will happen on that day, that the great trumpet will be blown, and those who were about to perish in the land of Assyria, and the exiles in the land of Egypt, will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
23:28:1/Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!
23:28:2/Look, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, who will come like a hailstorm and a destructive tempest, like a flood of mighty waters overflowing, to throw down to the ground with force.
23:28:3/The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trampled underfoot:
23:28:4/And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, will be a fading flower, and like the early fruit before summer; which when someone sees it, while it is still in their hand they eat it up.
23:28:5/On that day, the LORD of hosts will be a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, for the survivors of his people,
23:28:6/And a spirit of judgment for those who sit in judgment, and strength for those who push back the battle at the gate.
23:28:7/But they too have erred through wine, and through strong drink are led astray; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are overwhelmed by wine, they are led astray by strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
23:28:8/For all tables are covered with vomit and filthiness, so that there is no clean place.
23:28:9/Who will he teach knowledge? And who will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk, those just drawn from the breast.
23:28:10/For it must be line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.
23:28:11/For with stammering lips and another language he will speak to this people.
23:28:12/To whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of refreshment"—yet they would not listen.
23:28:13/But the word of the LORD was to them line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; so that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and captured.
23:28:14/Therefore, listen to the word of the LORD, you scornful men, who rule this people in Jerusalem.
23:28:15/Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with the grave we are in agreement; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, it will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood we have hidden ourselves."
23:28:16/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "Look, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who believes will not be in haste.
23:28:17/And I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overflow the hiding place.
23:28:18/Your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with the grave will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled by it.
23:28:19/From the time it passes through, it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.
23:28:20/For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow to wrap oneself in.
23:28:21/For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim, he will be angry as in the Valley of Gibeon, to do his work, his strange work; and to perform his task, his unusual task.
23:28:22/Now therefore, do not be mockers, lest your chains be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts of a destruction, even determined upon the whole earth.
23:28:23/Give ear and hear my voice; listen and hear my speech.
23:28:24/Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he open and break the clods of his ground?
23:28:25/When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter black cumin, sow cumin, and place wheat in rows, barley in its designated spot, and spelt in its place?
23:28:26/For his God instructs him rightly and teaches him.
23:28:27/For black cumin is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cumin; but black cumin is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
23:28:28/Grain for bread is crushed; indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever. Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually damage it, he does not crush it.
23:28:29/This also comes from the LORD of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
23:29:1/Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David lived! Keep adding year to year; let them continue their sacrifices.
23:29:2/Yet I will trouble Ariel, and there will be sadness and pain: and it will be to me like Ariel.
23:29:3/And I will encircle you completely, and lay siege to you with towers, and I will build ramparts against you.
23:29:4/And you will be humbled, and will speak from the ground, and your voice will be low from the dust, and your voice will be like that of a ghost from the ground, and your words will whisper from the dust.
23:29:5/Also, the multitude of your foreigners will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the fierce ones will be like chaff that vanishes away: indeed, it will happen suddenly in an instant.
23:29:6/You will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and loud noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of a consuming fire.
23:29:7/And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
23:29:8/It will be as when a hungry person dreams they are eating, but they wake up hungry: or as when a thirsty person dreams they are drinking, but they wake up faint and thirsty: so will the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against Mount Zion.
23:29:9/Pause and be amazed; shout out and cry: they are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
23:29:10/For the LORD has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your leaders, the seers he has covered.
23:29:11/And the vision of all has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which when they give it to someone who can read, saying, "Please read this," they say, "I can't; it's sealed."
23:29:12/And the book is given to someone who cannot read, saying, "Please read this," and they say, "I don't know how to read."
23:29:13/Therefore the Lord said, "Because this people approach me with their mouths and honor me with their lips, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their reverence for me is based on merely human rules,
23:29:14/Therefore, watch, I will perform a marvelous work among this people, a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden."
23:29:15/Woe to those who go to great lengths to hide their plans from the LORD, whose deeds are done in darkness, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"
23:29:16/Surely your turning things upside down will be regarded as the potter's clay: for can the work say of its maker, "He didn't make me"? Or can the thing formed say of the one who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
23:29:17/Isn't it just a short time until Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field, and the fertile field will be considered as a forest?
23:29:18/And in that day the deaf will hear the words of the book, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
23:29:19/The humble also will increase their joy in the LORD, and the needy among people will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23:29:20/For the ruthless will be no more, the mocker will be finished, and all who are eager for evil will be cut off:
23:29:21/Those who make a person guilty for a word, and set a trap for the one who reprimands in the court, and with false arguments deny justice to the righteous.
23:29:22/Therefore, this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says regarding the house of Jacob: "Jacob will no longer be ashamed, nor will his face grow pale.
23:29:23/But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will honor my name, they will honor the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23:29:24/Those who went astray in spirit will gain understanding, and those who complained will accept instruction.
23:30:1/Doom to the defiant ones, says the LORD, who seek advice but not from me; who seek protection but not from my spirit, only to pile up one sin on another.
23:30:2/Those who head down to Egypt without seeking my guidance; to rely on Pharaoh's power and place their trust in the protection of Egypt!
23:30:3/Therefore, Pharaoh's power will bring you shame, and your trust in Egypt's shadow will lead to your downfall.
23:30:4/For his officials were in Zoan, and his envoys reached Hanes.
23:30:5/They were all disgraced by a nation that could not benefit them, not an aid or gain, but only a cause for shame and insult.
23:30:6/The burden on the animals of the south: through a land of distress and danger, where lions, vipers, and fiery flying serpents live, they will carry their wealth on donkeys' backs and their treasures on camels, to a nation that will not benefit them.
23:30:7/For the Egyptians will offer help that is useless and pointless: that's why I have declared about this, Their only strength is to sit still.
23:30:8/Now go, write this down for them on a tablet, and record it in a book, so it may remain forever and ever.
23:30:9/This is a rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the LORD's instruction.
23:30:10/Who tell the seers, "Do not see," and the prophets, "Do not prophesy the truth to us. Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions.
23:30:11/Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel."
23:30:12/Therefore, the Holy One of Israel says, "Because you despise this message and trust in oppression and deceit, and rely on them,
23:30:13/this sin will become like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant.
23:30:14/It will break like a potter's jar, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern."
23:30:15/For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, says, "In repentance and rest you will be saved; in quietness and trust will be your strength." But you were unwilling.
23:30:16/But you said, "No, we will flee on horses." Therefore, you will flee! And, "We will ride on swift horses." Therefore, those who pursue you will be swift!
23:30:17/A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee until you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.
23:30:18/Yet the LORD waits to be gracious to you; therefore, he will rise up to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him.
23:30:19/People will live in Zion, in Jerusalem; you will weep no more. He will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you.
23:30:20/And though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will not be hidden anymore, but your eyes shall see your teachers.
23:30:21/And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
23:30:22/You will also defile the silver plating of your idols and the golden covering of your images. You will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, "Get away from me."
23:30:23/Then he will give rain for your seed with which you sow the soil, and bread from the yield of the ground, which will be rich and plentiful. On that day, your livestock will graze in broad pastures.
23:30:24/The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
23:30:25/On every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be streams running with water, on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
23:30:26/Furthermore, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the injuries of his people and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.
23:30:27/Behold, the name of the LORD comes from afar, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is like a consuming fire.
23:30:28/His breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be placed on the jaws of the peoples.
23:30:29/You will sing as on a night when a festival is kept, and your hearts will be joyful as when people march to the sound of the flute, to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
23:30:30/And the LORD will make his majestic voice heard and show the descending of his arm, with furious anger and the flame of a consuming fire, with cloudburst, storm, and hailstones.
23:30:31/For at the voice of the LORD, the Assyrian will be terrified, when He strikes with the rod.
23:30:32/And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD lays on him will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres, as He battles with brandished arm against them.
23:30:33/For Topheth has long been prepared; indeed, it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, sets it ablaze.
23:31:1/Doomed are those who seek help from Egypt, relying on horses, and putting their faith in chariots because they are numerous, and in horsemen because they are very powerful; yet they do not turn to the Holy One of Israel, nor do they seek the LORD!
23:31:2/But He too is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not retract His words: but will rise against the house of the wicked, and against those who assist evildoers.
23:31:3/The Egyptians are mere humans, not gods; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the LORD stretches out His hand, both the helper and the helped will fall, and they will all perish together.
23:31:4/For the LORD has told me this: Just as a lion or a young lion growls over its prey, and is not intimidated by the shouts of a group of shepherds, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for its hill.
23:31:5/Like birds in flight, so will the LORD of hosts protect Jerusalem; He will shield it, save it, and pass over it to preserve it.
23:31:6/Turn back to Him from whom the people of Israel have deeply strayed.
23:31:7/For on that day, everyone will discard their silver and gold idols, which you made with your own hands as a sin.
23:31:8/Then the Assyrian will fall by a sword not wielded by a mighty warrior; and a sword not held by an ordinary man will consume him: but he will flee from the sword, and his young men will be forced to flee.
23:31:9/He will rush to his stronghold out of fear, and his leaders will be terrified of the banner, says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23:32:1/A king will rule with fairness, and leaders will govern with justice.
23:32:2/And a person will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm; like streams of water in a desert, like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.
23:32:3/The eyes of those who see will not be clouded, and the ears of those who hear will listen attentively.
23:32:4/Even the impulsive will gain understanding, and those who struggle to speak will talk clearly and confidently.
23:32:5/The despicable person will no longer be praised as generous, nor will the miser be called kind.
23:32:6/For the despicable person will speak evil, and their heart will plot wrongdoing, to engage in deceit and to spread lies about the LORD, to leave the hungry empty and to deprive the thirsty of drink.
23:32:7/The tools of the miser are harmful: he plots evil schemes to ruin the poor with false accusations, even when the needy speaks the truth.
23:32:8/But the generous person plans generous actions; and by these actions, they will stand firm.
23:32:9/Stand up, you women who are comfortable; listen to my voice, you daughters who feel secure; pay attention to my words.
23:32:10/You will be troubled for many days and years, you women who are too comfortable: for the harvest will fail, and there will be no gathering of crops.
23:32:11/Shudder, you women who are at ease; be distressed, you who are complacent: strip off your clothes, and dress in sackcloth around your waists.
23:32:12/You will mourn for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines.
23:32:13/Thorns and briers will grow on the land of my people; yes, on all the joyful houses in the city of celebration.
23:32:14/The palaces will be abandoned; the bustling city will be deserted; the forts and watchtowers will become dens forever, a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks.
23:32:15/Until the spirit is poured upon us from above, and the wilderness becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field is considered a forest.
23:32:16/Then justice will reside in the wilderness, and righteousness will remain in the fertile field.
23:32:17/And the result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be tranquility and security forever.
23:32:18/And my people will live in peaceful homes, in secure dwellings, and in restful places.
23:32:19/When it hails, falling on the forest; and the city will be utterly humbled.
23:32:20/Blessed are you who plant beside all waters, who let the feet of the ox and the donkey roam free.
23:33:1/Doom to you who destroy, though you weren't destroyed; who betray, though none betrayed you! When you stop destroying, you will be destroyed; when you stop betraying, betrayal will come to you.
23:33:2/O LORD, be kind to us; we have waited for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in times of distress.
23:33:3/At the sound of the uproar, the people fled; when you rose up, the nations scattered.
23:33:4/Your plunder will be collected as caterpillars gather; as locusts swarm, so will they swarm over it.
23:33:5/The LORD is exalted, for he lives on high; he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
23:33:6/Wisdom and knowledge will be the stability of your times, and the strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.
23:33:7/See, their heroes cry out in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
23:33:8/The highways are deserted, travelers have stopped. He has broken the covenant, despised the cities, he cares for no one.
23:33:9/The earth mourns and withers; Lebanon is ashamed and decays; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
23:33:10/Now I will rise, says the LORD; now I will be exalted; now I will lift myself up.
23:33:11/You will conceive chaff, you will give birth to stubble; your breath, as fire, will consume you.
23:33:12/And the people will be like the burnings of lime; like thorns cut up they will be burned in the fire.
23:33:13/Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my power.
23:33:14/The sinners in Zion are terrified; trembling grips the hypocrites. Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with everlasting flames?
23:33:15/Those who walk righteously and speak honestly; who reject profit from oppression, who wave away a bribe instead of grabbing it, who stop their ears from hearing about bloodshed and shut their eyes from looking at evil;
23:33:16/They will live on high; their fortress will be the mountain strongholds: they will be provided with bread, their water will be reliable.
23:33:17/Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will see a land that stretches afar.
23:33:18/Your heart will ponder the terror: "Where is the scribe? Where is the one who weighed the tribute? Where is the one who counted the towers?"
23:33:19/You will not see a fierce people, a people with too obscure a speech for you to understand, with a stammering tongue that you cannot comprehend.
23:33:20/Look upon Zion, the city of our festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem as a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be moved; its stakes will never be pulled up, nor any of its ropes broken.
23:33:21/But there the majestic LORD will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams; no galley with oars will go there, nor will any mighty ship pass by it.
23:33:22/For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.
23:33:23/Your rigging is loose; they could not secure the base of their mast, they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil was divided; even the lame took the prey.
23:33:24/And the resident will not say, "I am sick"; the people who live there will be forgiven their iniquity.
23:34:1/Come closer, nations, to listen; and pay attention, people: let the earth and everything in it hear; the world, and all that comes out of it.
23:34:2/For the LORD's anger is against all nations, and his wrath against all their armies: he has completely destroyed them, he has handed them over to be slaughtered.
23:34:3/Their dead will be thrown out, and their bodies will stink; the mountains will flow with their blood.
23:34:4/And the entire sky will dissolve, and the heavens will roll up like a scroll: all the stars will fall, as leaves drop from the vine, and as ripe figs fall from the fig tree.
23:34:5/For my sword will be unsheathed in the heavens: look, it will descend upon Edom, and upon the people I have doomed, for judgment.
23:34:6/The sword of the LORD is drenched in blood, it is gorged with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23:34:7/And the wild oxen will fall with them, and the young bulls with the strong bulls; their land will be drenched with blood, and their soil enriched with fat.
23:34:8/For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, the year of retribution for Zion's cause.
23:34:9/And its streams will be turned into tar, and its dust into sulfur, and its land will become burning tar.
23:34:10/It will not be extinguished night or day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.
23:34:11/But the pelican and the porcupine will take it over; the owl and the raven will live in it. He will stretch over it the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.
23:34:12/Its nobles will have nowhere to proclaim a kingdom, and all its princes will be nothing.
23:34:13/Thorns will overrun its palaces, nettles and brambles its fortresses. It will become a lair for jackals, a court for ostriches.
23:34:14/The desert creatures will meet with the hyenas, and the wild goat will call to its friend; the night creature will also settle there and find a place of rest.
23:34:15/There the owl will nest and lay eggs, hatch them, and care for her young under her shadow; there also the vultures will gather, each with its mate.
23:34:16/Search in the book of the LORD and read: not one of these will be missing, none will lack its mate. For His mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.
23:34:17/He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it to them by line. They will possess it forever, from generation to generation they will dwell there.
23:35:1/The wilderness and the lonely places will be joyful for them; and the desert will be happy, blooming like a rose.
23:35:2/It will bloom profusely and celebrate with joy and singing: the splendor of Lebanon will be granted to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon, they will witness the splendor of the LORD, and the magnificence of our God.
23:35:3/Encourage those with weak hands, and make firm the knees that give way.
23:35:4/Tell those with anxious hearts, "Be strong, do not fear: look, your God will come with vengeance, with divine retribution; He will come to save you."
23:35:5/Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be cleared.
23:35:6/Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will shout for joy: for water will gush forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
23:35:7/And the dry ground will turn into a pool, and the thirsty land into springs of water: in the dwelling of jackals, where they lay, there will be grass with reeds and rushes.
23:35:8/And a highway will be there, a road, and it will be called the Highway of Holiness; the impure will not travel on it; it will be for those walking on the way: even if they are fools, they will not go astray.
23:35:9/No lion will be there, nor any ferocious beast will go up on it; they will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.
23:35:10/And those the LORD has saved will return, and enter Zion with singing, with eternal joy crowning their heads: they will attain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing will vanish.
23:36:1/In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
23:36:2/The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the road to the launderer's field.
23:36:3/Then Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder, came out to meet him.
23:36:4/And Rabshakeh said to them, "Tell Hezekiah that the great king, the king of Assyria, says, 'What is this confidence you have?'
23:36:5/"You claim to have strategy and strength for war, but these are just empty words. On whom are you depending, that you have rebelled against me?
23:36:6/"Look, you are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.
23:36:7/"But if you tell me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, telling Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar'?
23:36:8/"Now then, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
23:36:9/"How can you repel one of the least of my master's officials, even relying on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
23:36:10/"Have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD's guidance? The LORD himself told me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"
23:36:11/Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."
23:36:12/But Rabshakeh replied, "Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own waste and drink their own urine?"
23:36:13/Then Rabshakeh stood and called out in Hebrew, "Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
23:36:14/"This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you.
23:36:15/"Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
23:36:16/"Do not listen to Hezekiah. For this is what the king of Assyria says: 'Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,
23:36:17/"Until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.'
23:36:18/"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Have any of the gods of the nations ever delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
23:36:19/"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
23:36:20/"Who among all the gods of these lands have saved their lands from me, that the LORD should save Jerusalem from my hand?"
23:36:21/But they remained silent and did not answer him a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
23:36:22/Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
23:37:1/When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went into the temple of the LORD.
23:37:2/He sent Eliakim, the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23:37:3/They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace. It's like when children are about to be born, but there's no strength to deliver them.
23:37:4/Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to insult the living God, and will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the surviving remnant."
23:37:5/So King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah.
23:37:6/Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
23:37:7/Look, I will send a spirit upon him, and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.'"
23:37:8/So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
23:37:9/He heard reports about Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, saying, "He has come out to fight against you." So he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
23:37:10/"Tell Hezekiah king of Judah, 'Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying, "Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria."
23:37:11/You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
23:37:12/Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my ancestors deliver them—the nations such as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
23:37:13/Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'
23:37:14/Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
23:37:15/And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying,
23:37:16/"LORD of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
23:37:17/Turn your ear, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
23:37:18/It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
23:37:19/And have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of human hands—wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
23:37:20/Now, LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, LORD, are the only God."
23:37:21/Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
23:37:22/This is the word the LORD has spoken against him: 'The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you. The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.
23:37:23/Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23:37:24/Through your servants, you have insulted the Lord. You have said, "With my many chariots, I have climbed the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.
23:37:25/I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the soles of my feet, I have dried up all the streams of Egypt."
23:37:26/Have you not heard? Long ago I did it; from ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should turn fortified cities into piles of rubble.
23:37:27/Their inhabitants, powerless, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass on the rooftops, scorched before it grows up.
23:37:28/But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
23:37:29/Because you rage against me and your arrogance has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.
23:37:30/This will be a sign for you: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and in the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23:37:31/The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
23:37:32/For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.
23:37:33/Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
23:37:34/By the way he came, by the same he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the LORD.
23:37:35/I will defend this city and save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."
23:37:36/Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!
23:37:37/So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
23:37:38/While he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
23:38:1/In those days, Hezekiah was gravely ill. Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz, came to him and said, "This is what the LORD says: Get your affairs in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."
23:38:2/Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
23:38:3/He said, "Please remember, LORD, how I have lived truthfully before you with a whole heart, doing what is right in your eyes." And Hezekiah cried bitterly.
23:38:4/Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
23:38:5/"Go and tell Hezekiah, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. Look, I will add fifteen years to your life.
23:38:6/And I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria's hand; I will protect this city.
23:38:7/This will be the sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do what he has promised:
23:38:8/See, I will make the shadow cast by the sun on the sundial of Ahaz go back ten steps." So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.
23:38:9/This is the account of Hezekiah king of Judah when he was ill and then recovered from his illness:
23:38:10/I thought, "In the prime of my life, I must enter the gates of the grave; I am deprived of the rest of my years."
23:38:11/I said, "I will not see the LORD, the LORD in the land of the living; I will look on humanity no more among the inhabitants of the earth.
23:38:12/My dwelling is pulled up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up my life like a weaver; He cuts me off from the loom; from day to night you bring me to an end.
23:38:13/I waited patiently till morning, but like a lion, he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end.
23:38:14/I cried like a crane or a swallow; I moaned like a dove. My eyes grow weak looking heavenward. LORD, I am in distress; be my guarantor.
23:38:15/What can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will wander all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
23:38:16/LORD, by such things people live; and in all of them is the life of my spirit. So you will restore me and make me live.
23:38:17/Indeed, it was for my own peace that I had great bitterness; but you have loved my soul out of the pit of destruction, for you have thrown all my sins behind your back.
23:38:18/For the grave cannot praise you, death cannot celebrate you; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.
23:38:19/The living, the living—they praise you, as I am doing today; parents tell their children about your faithfulness.
23:38:20/The LORD was ready to save me; therefore, we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
23:38:21/For Isaiah had said, "Let them take a lump of figs and apply it as a poultice on the boil, and he will recover."
23:38:22/Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I will go up to the house of the LORD?"
23:39:1/At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered.
23:39:2/And Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them his treasury, the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, his armory, and everything in his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in his entire realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
23:39:3/Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did these men say? And where did they come from to visit you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come from a distant country, from Babylon."
23:39:4/Isaiah then asked, "What have they seen in your house?" And Hezekiah replied, "They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."
23:39:5/Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to the word of the LORD Almighty:"
23:39:6/"Look, the time is coming when everything in your house, and all that your ancestors have stored up until this day, will be taken to Babylon. Nothing will be left," says the LORD.
23:39:7/"And some of your own descendants, your own offspring, will be taken away. They will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
23:39:8/Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD you have spoken is good." He also said, "For there will be peace and truth in my lifetime."
23:40:1/Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
23:40:2/Talk to Jerusalem with tenderness, and proclaim to her that her time of hardship is over, that her sins are forgiven; for she has received from the LORD twice over for all her sins.
23:40:3/A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'
23:40:4/Every valley shall be raised up, and every mountain and hill made low; the crooked places shall become straight, and the rough places smooth.
23:40:5/And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all people will see it together; for the LORD has spoken.
23:40:6/The voice said, 'Cry out.' And I said, 'What shall I cry out?' All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.
23:40:7/The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows on it; surely the people are grass.
23:40:8/The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God endures forever.
23:40:9/O Zion, messenger of good news, go up on a high mountain; O Jerusalem, messenger of good news, raise your voice with strength; raise it, do not be afraid; say to the cities of Judah, 'Look, your God!'
23:40:10/Look, the Lord GOD comes with power, and his arm rules for him; look, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
23:40:11/He will tend his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms, and carry them close to his heart; he will gently lead those that have young.
23:40:12/Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?
23:40:13/Who has understood the mind of the LORD, or instructed him as his counselor?
23:40:14/Whom did he consult to enlighten him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding?
23:40:15/Indeed, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as dust on the scales; he lifts up the islands like fine dust.
23:40:16/Even Lebanon is not enough to fuel, nor its animals enough for a burnt offering.
23:40:17/All the nations are as nothing before him; they are regarded by him as less than nothing and emptiness.
23:40:18/To whom, then, will you compare God? What image will you compare him to?
23:40:19/The craftsman casts an idol, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
23:40:20/A person too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple.
23:40:21/Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
23:40:22/He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
23:40:23/He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
23:40:24/No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
23:40:25/To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.
23:40:26/Look up and see who has created these stars, the One who leads out their host by number, calling them all by name; because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
23:40:27/Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, 'My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God'?
23:40:28/Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
23:40:29/He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
23:40:30/Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;
23:40:31/But those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
23:41:1/Stay quiet before me, O islands; and let the people regain their strength: let them approach, then let them speak: let's come together for judgment.
23:41:2/Who brought forth the righteous man from the east, summoned him to his side, handed nations over to him, and made him ruler over kings? He turned them into dust with his sword, and like scattered straw with his bow.
23:41:3/He chased them and moved on safely; even by paths his feet had not traveled.
23:41:4/Who has accomplished and done this, summoning the generations from the start? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.
23:41:5/The islands saw it and were afraid; the ends of the earth trembled, drew close, and came together.
23:41:6/They supported each other; and everyone told their neighbor, Be strong.
23:41:7/So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and the one smoothing with the hammer supported the one striking the anvil, saying, It's ready for soldering: and he secured it with nails, so it wouldn't move.
23:41:8/But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham my friend.
23:41:9/You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called from its leaders, and said to you, You are my servant; I have chosen you and not rejected you.
23:41:10/Do not fear; for I am with you: do not be dismayed; for I am your God: I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will support you with my righteous right hand.
23:41:11/See, all those angry with you will be ashamed and disgraced: they will be as nothing; and those who oppose you will perish.
23:41:12/You will look for them, and not find them, those who argued with you: those who fight against you will be as nothing, as if they never existed.
23:41:13/For I the LORD your God will hold your right hand, telling you, Do not fear; I will assist you.
23:41:14/Do not fear, you lowly Jacob, and you people of Israel; I will help you, declares the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
23:41:15/See, I will make you into a new sharp threshing tool with teeth: you will thresh the mountains, and crush them, and turn the hills into chaff.
23:41:16/You will scatter them, and the wind will carry them away, and a whirlwind will disperse them: and you will rejoice in the LORD, and take pride in the Holy One of Israel.
23:41:17/When the poor and needy search for water, and there is none, and their tongue is parched from thirst, I the LORD will answer them, I the God of Israel will not abandon them.
23:41:18/I will open rivers on the barren heights, and springs in the midst of the valleys: I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs.
23:41:19/I will plant in the desert the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive; I will set in the wasteland the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together:
23:41:20/So that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23:41:21/Present your case, says the LORD; bring forth your strong arguments, says the King of Jacob.
23:41:22/Let them bring them forth, and show us what will happen: let them reveal the past events, what they were, that we may consider them, and know their outcome; or declare to us things to come.
23:41:23/Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: indeed, do something good or bad, that we may be dismayed, and see it together.
23:41:24/See, you are nothing, and your deeds amount to nothing: an abomination is he who chooses you.
23:41:25/I have raised up one from the north, and he will come: from the sunrise he will call upon my name: and he will come upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
23:41:26/Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforehand, that we may say, He is right? indeed, there is no one who shows, indeed, there is no one who declares, indeed, there is no one who hears your words.
23:41:27/The first will say to Zion, Look, look at them: and I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good news.
23:41:28/For I looked, and there was no one; among them, and there was no adviser, that, when I asked of them, could respond.
23:41:29/See, they are all futile; their works are nothing: their cast images are wind and confusion.
23:42:1/Look at my servant, whom I support; my chosen one, who brings me great joy; I have placed my spirit upon him: he will deliver justice to the nations.
23:42:2/He won't shout or raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the streets.
23:42:3/He won't break a bruised reed, or snuff out a smoldering wick: he will bring forth justice faithfully.
23:42:4/He won't falter or lose heart until he has established justice on earth: and the distant lands will await his teachings.
23:42:5/This is what God the LORD says, the creator of the heavens, who stretched them out; who spread out the earth and all that comes from it; who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it:
23:42:6/I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the nations,
23:42:7/To open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison, and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
23:42:8/I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.
23:42:9/See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they happen I announce them to you.
23:42:10/Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it, the islands, and their inhabitants.
23:42:11/Let the desert and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of the rock sing; let them shout from the mountaintops.
23:42:12/Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands.
23:42:13/The LORD will march out like a champion, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout, he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies.
23:42:14/For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant.
23:42:15/I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools.
23:42:16/And I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them.
23:42:17/Those who trust in idols, who say to the images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame.
23:42:18/Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see!
23:42:19/Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one in covenant with me, blind like the servant of the LORD?
23:42:20/You have seen many things, but you pay no attention; your ears are open, but you do not listen.
23:42:21/The LORD is pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will exalt the law and make it glorious.
23:42:22/But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, 'Send them back.'
23:42:23/Who among you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come?
23:42:24/Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law.
23:42:25/So he poured on them his burning anger and the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
23:43:1/But now, this is what the LORD says, the one who created you, Jacob, and formed you, Israel: Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name; you are mine.
23:43:2/When you go through deep waters, I will be with you; when you go through rivers, they won't sweep you away. When you walk through fire, you won't be scorched, and the flames won't set you ablaze.
23:43:3/For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I gave Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in your place.
23:43:4/Since you are precious in my eyes, you have been honored, and I have loved you. Therefore, I will exchange others for you and give nations in exchange for your life.
23:43:5/Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bring your descendants from the east and gather you from the west.
23:43:6/I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.' Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth.
23:43:7/Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.
23:43:8/Bring out the people who are blind yet have eyes, and the deaf yet have ears.
23:43:9/Let all the nations gather together, and let the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this and show us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to prove they were right, so others may hear and say, 'It is true.'
23:43:10/You are my witnesses, declares the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me.
23:43:11/I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior.
23:43:12/I have declared, saved, and proclaimed, when there was no foreign god among you. Therefore, you are my witnesses, declares the LORD, that I am God.
23:43:13/Indeed, before the day was, I am he; and there is no one who can deliver from my hand. I will act, and who can reverse it?
23:43:14/This is what the LORD says, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake, I have sent to Babylon and brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.
23:43:15/I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
23:43:16/This is what the LORD says, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters.
23:43:17/Who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they will lie down together, they will not rise again; they are extinguished, snuffed out like a wick.
23:43:18/Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
23:43:19/See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.
23:43:20/The wild animals will honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people.
23:43:21/The people I formed for myself will declare my praise.
23:43:22/Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; you have grown tired of me, Israel.
23:43:23/You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
23:43:24/You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
23:43:25/I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.
23:43:26/Remind me; let us argue the matter together. State your case, so that you may be proved right.
23:43:27/Your first father sinned, and your mediators have transgressed against me.
23:43:28/Therefore, I have disgraced the princes of the sanctuary; I have consigned Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
23:44:1/Listen now, Jacob, my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen:
23:44:2/This is what the LORD who created you, and shaped you from before you were born, says: I will support you; do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant, and Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
23:44:3/I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground; I will pour my spirit on your descendants, and my blessing on your children.
23:44:4/They will grow like grass in a meadow, like poplars by flowing streams.
23:44:5/Some will say, 'I belong to the LORD'; others will call themselves by the name of Jacob; another will write on his hand, 'The LORD's,' and adopt the name Israel.
23:44:6/This is what the LORD, the King of Israel and its Redeemer, the LORD Almighty, says: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.
23:44:7/Who else has called forth the generations from the beginning? Let them show us what is yet to come, and predict what will happen.
23:44:8/Do not fear, nor be afraid; haven't I told you from long ago and declared it? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.
23:44:9/Those who craft idols are all nothing; their cherished works will not benefit them. They are their own witnesses; they see nothing and know nothing, so they will be put to shame.
23:44:10/Who has created a god or cast an idol to no benefit?
23:44:11/Behold, all who associate with it will be ashamed; the craftsmen themselves are just men. Let them all come together and stand up; they will all be frightened and put to shame.
23:44:12/The blacksmith takes tools and works in the coals; he shapes it with hammers and works it with his strong arms. Yet he is hungry and his strength fails; he doesn't drink water and grows faint.
23:44:13/The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in human form, in all its glory, to dwell in a shrine.
23:44:14/He cuts down cedars or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.
23:44:15/It is used as fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
23:44:16/He burns half of it in the fire; over that half he eats meat, he roasts a roast and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, "Ah, I am warm, I see the fire."
23:44:17/From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, "Save me; you are my god."
23:44:18/They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
23:44:19/No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?"
23:44:20/He feeds on ashes; a deluded heart misleads him. He cannot save himself, or say, "Isn't this thing in my right hand a lie?"
23:44:21/Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant. I have made you, you are my servant; Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
23:44:22/I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
23:44:23/Sing for joy, you heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout aloud, you earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and displays his glory in Israel.
23:44:24/This is what the LORD, your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb says: I am the LORD, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself,
23:44:25/Who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense,
23:44:26/Who carries out the words of his servants and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, 'It shall be inhabited,' and of the towns of Judah, 'They shall be rebuilt, and I will restore their ruins,'
23:44:27/Who says to the watery deep, 'Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,'
23:44:28/Who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Let its foundations be laid."'
23:45:1/This is what the LORD says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him; I will disarm kings to open doors before him so that gates will not remain closed:
23:45:2/I will lead the way and straighten out the winding paths: I will shatter the bronze gates and slice through the iron bars:
23:45:3/And I will give you the treasures hidden in darkness and the secret riches stored in secret places, so you may know that I, the LORD, who calls you by your name, am the God of Israel.
23:45:4/For the sake of Jacob my servant, and Israel my chosen, I have called you by your name and given you a title of honor, even though you do not know me.
23:45:5/I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me:
23:45:6/So that people may know from the rising of the sun to its setting that there is none besides me. I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23:45:7/I create the light and make the darkness: I bring peace and create calamity: I, the LORD, do all these things.
23:45:8/Let the heavens rain down righteousness; let the skies pour it down. Let the earth open wide so salvation and righteousness can sprout together; I, the LORD, have created it.
23:45:9/Woe to those who argue with their Maker! Let pottery shards argue with other shards. Does clay ask the one who shapes it, 'What are you making?' or your work say, 'He has no hands'?
23:45:10/Woe to the one who says to a father, 'What have you fathered?' or to a mother, 'What have you brought to birth?'
23:45:11/This is what the LORD says, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Ask me about the future concerning my children, and regarding the work of my hands, you may command me.
23:45:12/I have made the earth and created mankind upon it. My own hands have stretched out the heavens; I have commanded all their host.
23:45:13/I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his paths straight: he will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, not for a price or reward, says the LORD Almighty.
23:45:14/This is what the LORD says: The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, tall men, will come to you and be yours; they will follow you, coming over in chains. They will bow down to you and plead with you, saying, 'Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.'
23:45:15/Truly, you are a God who has been hiding himself, the God and Savior of Israel.
23:45:16/All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will go off in disgrace together.
23:45:17/But Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.
23:45:18/For this is what the LORD says—He who created the heavens, He is God; He who fashioned and made the earth, He founded it; He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited—He says: 'I am the LORD, and there is no other.'
23:45:19/I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I did not say to Jacob's descendants, 'Seek me in vain.' I, the LORD, speak the truth; I declare what is right.
23:45:20/Gather together and come; assemble, you survivors of the nations! They are ignorant who carry about their wooden idols and pray to gods that cannot save.
23:45:21/Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together. Who has announced this from ancient times? Who has declared it from that time? Have not I, the LORD? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me.
23:45:22/Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.
23:45:23/I have sworn by myself, the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness and will not return: That to me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.
23:45:24/Surely, one will say, 'In the LORD alone are righteousness and strength.' All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame.
23:45:25/In the LORD all the descendants of Israel will find justice and will boast.
23:46:1/Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the animals, and on the livestock: your loads were heavy; they are a burden to the tired animal.
23:46:2/They stoop, they bow down together; they couldn't deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into captivity.
23:46:3/Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remaining people of the house of Israel, who have been supported by me since birth, who have been carried from the womb:
23:46:4/And even to your old age I am he; and even to gray hairs I will carry you: I have made, and I will bear; indeed, I will carry, and will save you.
23:46:5/To whom will you compare me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?
23:46:6/They pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver on the scales, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it a god: they bow down, indeed, they worship.
23:46:7/They lift it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands; from its place it shall not move: yes, someone may cry to it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him from his trouble.
23:46:8/Remember this, and be brave: recall it to mind, O you rebels.
23:46:9/Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me,
23:46:10/Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, My plan shall stand, and I will do all that I please:
23:46:11/Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man who executes my plan from a far country: indeed, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have planned it, I will also do it.
23:46:12/Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness:
23:46:13/I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far away, and my salvation shall not delay: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
23:47:1/Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne for you, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you will no longer be called tender and delicate.
23:47:2/Take the millstones, and grind flour: uncover your hair, bare your leg, reveal your thigh, cross the rivers.
23:47:3/Your nakedness will be exposed, indeed, your shame will be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not confront you as a man.
23:47:4/As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
23:47:5/Sit in silence, and enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you will no longer be called, The lady of kingdoms.
23:47:6/I was angry with my people, I have defiled my inheritance, and handed them over to you: you showed them no mercy; on the elderly you have heavily laid your yoke.
23:47:7/And you thought, I shall be a lady forever: so that you did not take these things to heart, nor did you remember their eventual outcome.
23:47:8/Therefore hear now this, you who are devoted to pleasures, who live carelessly, who say in your heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children:
23:47:9/But these two things shall come to you suddenly in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon you in full measure because of the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your spells.
23:47:10/For you have trusted in your wickedness: you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge, they have misled you; and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me.
23:47:11/Therefore disaster will come upon you; you will not know how to ward it off: and calamity will fall upon you; you will not be able to avoid it: and sudden ruin will come upon you unexpectedly.
23:47:12/Stand now with your spells, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you will be able to benefit, perhaps you may cause fear.
23:47:13/You are exhausted from the multitude of your schemes. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from what is coming upon you.
23:47:14/Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there will not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.
23:47:15/Thus shall they be to you with whom you have labored, even your merchants, from your youth: they shall wander each to his own way; none shall save you.
23:48:1/Listen to this, O descendants of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel and have emerged from the lineage of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and mention the God of Israel, but not sincerely or justly.
23:48:2/For they claim to belong to the holy city and rely on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.
23:48:3/I have announced what was to come from the start; they were spoken by me, and I showed them; I acted swiftly, and they happened.
23:48:4/Because I knew you are stubborn, with a neck as inflexible as iron and a forehead as hard as bronze;
23:48:5/I have told you from the beginning, before it happened I showed it to you: so you couldn't claim your idol did them, or your carved and cast images commanded them.
23:48:6/You have heard, now see all this; and won't you admit it? I have revealed new things to you, secrets you did not know.
23:48:7/These things are now brought into being, not long ago; before today you did not hear of them, so you cannot say, 'Oh, I knew about them.'
23:48:8/Indeed, you did not hear; indeed, you did not know; indeed, from long ago your ear was not open. For I knew you would act very deceitfully, and were called a rebel from birth.
23:48:9/For the sake of my name, I will hold back my anger, and for my praise, I will restrain it from you, so as not to cut you off.
23:48:10/See, I have refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
23:48:11/For my own sake, for my very own sake, I will act: for how could my name be defiled? I will not give my glory to another.
23:48:12/Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I have called; I am he; I am the first, and I am also the last.
23:48:13/My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they stand up together.
23:48:14/Gather together and listen; who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him: he will carry out his will on Babylon, and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.
23:48:15/I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him. I have brought him, and his path will be successful.
23:48:16/Come closer to me, listen to this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time it happened, I was there: and now the Lord GOD and his Spirit have sent me.
23:48:17/This is what the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says; I am the LORD your God who teaches you for your benefit, who guides you in the way you should go.
23:48:18/If only you had paid attention to my commands! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
23:48:19/Your descendants would have been like the sand, and your offspring like its grains; their name would not have been cut off or destroyed from before me.
23:48:20/Leave Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, with a voice of joy announce this, proclaim it, send it out to the ends of the earth; say, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.
23:48:21/And they did not thirst when he led them through the deserts: he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock, and the water gushed out.
23:48:22/There is no peace, says the LORD, for the wicked.
23:49:1/Listen, O islands, to me; and pay attention, you people from far away; The LORD has called me from the womb; from my mother's body, he has mentioned my name.
23:49:2/He has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand, he has hidden me, and made me a polished arrow; in his quiver, he has concealed me.
23:49:3/And he said to me, "You are my servant, O Israel, in whom I will show my glory."
23:49:4/Then I said, "I have worked hard for nothing, I have used up my strength for no purpose or gain: yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God."
23:49:5/And now, says the LORD who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him - for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has become my strength -
23:49:6/And he said, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth."
23:49:7/This is what the LORD says, the Redeemer of Israel, and its Holy One, to the one despised by people, to the one abhorred by nations, to the servant of rulers: "Kings will see you and stand up, princes will see and bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
23:49:8/This is what the LORD says: "In the time of my favor, I have answered you, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances,
23:49:9/To say to the captives, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!' They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill.
23:49:10/They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat down on them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
23:49:11/I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up.
23:49:12/See, they will come from afar - some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan."
23:49:13/Sing for joy, you heavens; rejoice, you earth; burst into song, you mountains! For the LORD comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.
23:49:14/But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me."
23:49:15/Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!
23:49:16/See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me.
23:49:17/Your children hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you.
23:49:18/Look around and see; all your children gather and come to you. As surely as I live," declares the LORD, "you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride.
23:49:19/Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your residents, and those who devoured you will be far away.
23:49:20/The children you will have, after you have lost the others, will say in your ears, 'This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.'
23:49:21/Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has borne me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these - where have they come from?'"
23:49:22/This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I will beckon to the nations, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their hips.
23:49:23/Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in me will not be disappointed."
23:49:24/Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?
23:49:25/But this is what the LORD says: "Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save.
23:49:26/And I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine. Then all mankind will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
23:50:1/The LORD says, "Where is the divorce paper of your mother, whom I have sent away? Or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Look, it's because of your own sins that you were sold, and because of your own wrongdoings, your mother was sent away.
23:50:2/So why, when I arrived, was no one there? When I called, why did no one answer? Is my power so limited that I can't save? Or am I so weak that I can't rescue? Look, with just a rebuke I can dry up the sea, I can turn rivers into deserts: their fish rot because there's no water, and die of thirst.
23:50:3/I cover the skies with darkness, and make sackcloth their blanket.
23:50:4/The Lord GOD has given me the ability to speak wisely, to offer the right word to those who are tired. He wakes me up every morning, he sharpens my hearing to listen like those who are learned.
23:50:5/The Lord GOD has made me attentive, and I haven't been rebellious or turned away.
23:50:6/I offered my back to those who beat me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from disgrace and spitting.
23:50:7/For the Lord GOD will support me; therefore, I will not be disgraced: therefore, I have set my face like a rock, and I know that I will not be put to shame.
23:50:8/He who vindicates me is near; who will argue with me? Let us confront each other: who is my opponent? Let him approach me.
23:50:9/See, the Lord GOD will assist me; who then can declare me guilty? Look, they will all wear out like a garment; the moths will devour them.
23:50:10/Who among you respects the LORD, listens to the voice of his servant, walks in darkness without any light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD, and rely on his God.
23:50:11/See, all you who light a fire, who surround yourselves with flames: walk in the light of your fire and in the flames you've set ablaze. This is what you'll get from my hand; you will lie down in torment.
23:51:1/Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and seek the LORD: remember the rock from which you were cut, and the quarry from which you were mined.
23:51:2/Consider Abraham your father, and Sarah who gave birth to you: I called him alone, blessed him, and made him prosper.
23:51:3/For the LORD will comfort Zion: He will comfort all her ruins; He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found there, along with thanksgiving and the sound of music.
23:51:4/Listen to me, my people; pay attention, my nation: a law will come from me, and I will set my justice as a light for the peoples.
23:51:5/My righteousness is near; my salvation has gone out, and my arms will judge the peoples; the islands will wait for me, and they will put their trust in my strength.
23:51:6/Look up at the skies, and gaze at the earth below: for the skies will disappear like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and its inhabitants will die like flies: but my salvation will last forever, and my righteousness will never fail.
23:51:7/Listen to me, you who know what is right, you people who have my law in your hearts; do not fear the scorn of humans, nor be terrified by their insults.
23:51:8/For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will devour them like wool: but my righteousness will last forever, and my salvation for all generations.
23:51:9/Wake up, wake up, flex your muscles, O arm of the LORD; wake up as in the days of old, as in generations past. Were you not the one who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced the dragon?
23:51:10/Were you not the one who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made a road in the depths of the sea for the redeemed to cross over?
23:51:11/Therefore, the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with everlasting joy; they will obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23:51:12/I, even I, am the one who comforts you: why are you afraid of a mortal who will die, and of a human being who will fade like grass?
23:51:13/And you forget the LORD your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth; you live in constant terror every day because of the wrath of the oppressor, as if he were about to destroy? But where is the wrath of the oppressor?
23:51:14/The captive exile hastens to be set free, so that he will not die in the dungeon, nor will his bread be lacking.
23:51:15/But I am the LORD your God, who churns up the sea so that its waves roar—The LORD of hosts is His name.
23:51:16/And I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you with the shadow of my hand, to establish the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and to say to Zion, 'You are my people.'
23:51:17/Wake up, wake up, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the LORD's hand the cup of His wrath; you have drunk to the dregs the cup of staggering, and drained it.
23:51:18/There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne; there is no one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has raised.
23:51:19/These two things have happened to you—who will mourn for you?—devastation and destruction, famine and sword; who will comfort you?
23:51:20/Your sons have fainted; they lie at every street corner, like an antelope caught in a net. They are filled with the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
23:51:21/Therefore hear this, you afflicted one, made drunk, but not with wine.
23:51:22/This is what your Sovereign LORD says, your God who defends His people: "See, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering; the goblet of my wrath you will never drink again.
23:51:23/But I will put it into the hands of those who afflict you, who have said to you, 'Bow down, that we may walk on you.' And you have made your back like the ground, like a street for them to walk on.
23:52:1/Wake up, wake up; put on your strength, O Zion; dress in your finest, O Jerusalem, the holy city: from now on, the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer enter you.
23:52:2/Shake off the dust; rise up, and take your seat, O Jerusalem: free yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
23:52:3/For this is what the LORD says, You have sold yourselves for nothing; and you will be redeemed without money.
23:52:4/For this is what the Sovereign LORD says, My people previously went down to Egypt to live there; and the Assyrian oppressed them for no reason.
23:52:5/So now, what do I have here, says the LORD, that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them cause them to cry out, says the LORD; and my name is constantly, every day, disrespected.
23:52:6/Therefore my people will know my name: therefore, on that day, they will know that it is I who speaks: here I am.
23:52:7/How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the one who brings good news, who announces peace; who brings good news of happiness, who announces salvation; who tells Zion, Your God reigns!
23:52:8/Your watchmen will raise their voices; together they will sing for joy: for they will see eye to eye, when the LORD returns to Zion.
23:52:9/Burst into songs of joy, sing together, you ruins of Jerusalem: for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
23:52:10/The LORD has revealed his holy power in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth will witness the salvation of our God.
23:52:11/Leave, leave, go out from there, touch no unclean thing; go out from its midst; purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.
23:52:12/For you will not leave in haste, nor will you go in flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
23:52:13/See, my servant will act wisely, he will be raised and lifted up, and will be highly exalted.
23:52:14/Just as many were appalled at him— his appearance was so disfigured, beyond that of any human, and his form marred beyond human likeness—
23:52:15/So he will sprinkle many nations; kings will shut their mouths because of him: for what they were not told, they will see; and what they have not heard, they will understand.
23:53:1/Who has believed what we've reported? And to whom has the LORD's power been revealed?
23:53:2/He will grow up before him like a young plant, and like a root from dry ground. He has no striking form or majesty that we should look at him, no appearance that we should be attracted to him.
23:53:3/He is ignored and rejected by people; a man who knows sorrow well, and familiar with suffering. Like someone from whom people hide their faces, he was ignored, and we didn't value him.
23:53:4/Indeed, he took on our suffering and bore our pain. Yet we considered him punished by God, struck down, and afflicted.
23:53:5/But he was pierced for our wrongdoings, crushed for our sins; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds, we are healed.
23:53:6/We all, like sheep, have gone astray; each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has placed on him the iniquity of us all.
23:53:7/He was oppressed and tormented, yet he didn't speak out. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he didn't open his mouth.
23:53:8/He was taken from detention and judgment; and who will consider his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; struck down for the transgression of my people.
23:53:9/He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, although he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
23:53:10/Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer; and though the LORD makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.
23:53:11/After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.
23:53:12/Therefore, I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was counted among the transgressors; for he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
23:54:1/Sing, O barren one, you who did not give birth; burst into song and shout, you who did not go through labor: for the children of the desolate are more numerous than the children of the married woman, says the LORD.
23:54:2/Expand the space of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings: do not hold back, lengthen your ropes, and strengthen your stakes;
23:54:3/For you will spread out to the right and to the left; and your descendants will inherit the nations, and repopulate the abandoned cities.
23:54:4/Do not fear; for you will not be ashamed: neither be confused; for you will not be disgraced: for you will forget the shame of your youth, and will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.
23:54:5/For your Maker is your husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
23:54:6/For the LORD has called you like a woman abandoned and heartbroken, and a wife of youth, when you were rejected, says your God.
23:54:7/For a brief moment I abandoned you; but with great compassion I will bring you back.
23:54:8/In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on you, says the LORD your Redeemer.
23:54:9/For this is to me like the waters of Noah: as I have sworn that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.
23:54:10/For the mountains may move, and the hills may shake; but my kindness will not depart from you, nor will my covenant of peace be shaken, says the LORD who has compassion on you.
23:54:11/O you afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
23:54:12/And I will make your windows of agates, and your gates of sparkling gems, and all your borders of delightful stones.
23:54:13/And all your children shall be taught by the LORD; and great shall be the peace of your children.
23:54:14/In righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near you.
23:54:15/Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you shall fall for your sake.
23:54:16/Behold, I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon for his work; and I have created the destroyer to wreak havoc.
23:54:17/No weapon forged against you will prevail; and you will refute every tongue that accuses you in court. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their vindication is from me, says the LORD.
23:55:1/Hey, everyone who's thirsty, come to the water, and if you don't have any money, come anyway. Buy and eat. Yes, come get wine and milk without spending a dime.
23:55:2/Why do you spend your money on stuff that isn't real food? And your hard work on things that don't satisfy? Listen closely to me, and eat what's truly good, and let your soul enjoy its richness.
23:55:3/Pay attention and come to me; listen, and you will find life. I will make a lasting promise to you, the same faithful love I promised to David.
23:55:4/Look, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for them.
23:55:5/Look, you will call to a nation you do not know, and nations that did not know you will rush to you because of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has made you glorious.
23:55:6/Search for the LORD while he can be found, call on him while he is close.
23:55:7/Let the wicked abandon their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely forgive.
23:55:8/For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.
23:55:9/Just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
23:55:10/Just as rain and snow fall from the sky and don't return without watering the earth, making it bud and flourish, providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
23:55:11/So is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
23:55:12/You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
23:55:13/Instead of thorns, the fir tree will grow, and instead of briers, the myrtle will grow. This will be for the LORD's renown, for an everlasting sign that will not be destroyed.
23:56:1/This is what the LORD says, "Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed."
23:56:2/Blessed is the person who does this, the one who holds it firmly; who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps their hands from doing any wrong.
23:56:3/And let not the foreigner who has joined themselves to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely exclude me from his people." And let not the eunuch complain, "I am only a barren tree."
23:56:4/For this is what the LORD says: "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant,
23:56:5/To them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
23:56:6/And foreigners who bind themselves to the LORD to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant—
23:56:7/These I will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations."
23:56:8/The Sovereign LORD, who gathers the exiles of Israel, declares, "I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered."
23:56:9/All you animals of the field, come to devour, all you animals in the forest.
23:56:10/His watchmen are blind, lacking knowledge; they are all silent dogs, unable to bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to sleep.
23:56:11/Indeed, they are greedy dogs that can never have enough. They are shepherds with no understanding; they all turn to their own way, each seeks their own gain.
23:56:12/Come, they say, let's get wine and let's drink our fill of beer; and tomorrow will be like today, only much better.
23:57:1/Good people pass away, and no one cares. Merciful people are taken away, with no one realizing that the righteous are spared from the coming evil.
23:57:2/They will find peace; they will rest in their beds, each one walking in their integrity.
23:57:3/But come here, you children of a sorceress, offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute.
23:57:4/Who are you mocking? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Aren't you the offspring of rebellion, born of deceit,
23:57:5/Burning with lust among the idols under every green tree, murdering the children in the valleys under the cliffs of the rocks?
23:57:6/Your share is among the smooth stones of the stream; they are your lot. Even to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. Should I be comforted by these?
23:57:7/On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifices.
23:57:8/Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial. For you have uncovered yourself to someone other than me, and have gone up; you have enlarged your bed and made a pact with them; you loved their bed where you saw it.
23:57:9/You went to the king with oil and increased your perfumes, and sent your envoys far away, degrading yourself even to the depths.
23:57:10/You are exhausted by your extensive travels, yet you did not say, 'It's hopeless.' You found renewed strength, so you did not weaken.
23:57:11/Whom were you so afraid of that you lied, and didn't remember me or take it to heart? Have I not been silent for a long time, and you don't fear me?
23:57:12/I will expose your righteousness and your deeds, but they will not benefit you.
23:57:13/When you cry out, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry them all off, a mere breath will take them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.
23:57:14/And it will be said: "Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people."
23:57:15/For this is what the high and exalted One says—He who lives forever, whose name is Holy: "I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.
23:57:16/For I will not accuse forever, nor will I always be angry, for then the spirit of humans would grow faint before me— the breath of life I have created.
23:57:17/I was angry because of their greedy dishonesty; I punished them, and hid myself in anger, yet they kept turning back to their own ways.
23:57:18/I have seen their ways, but I will heal them; I will guide them and restore comfort to them and their mourners,
23:57:19/creating praise on their lips. Peace, peace, to those far and near," says the LORD. "And I will heal them."
23:57:20/But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud.
23:57:21/"There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
23:58:1/Shout loudly, don't hold back, raise your voice like a trumpet, and show my people their wrongdoings, and the descendants of Jacob their sins.
23:58:2/Yet they seek me every day, and are eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did what was right, and did not abandon the laws of their God: they ask me for just rulings; they enjoy coming close to God.
23:58:3/"Why have we fasted," they say, "and you haven't noticed? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you haven't paid attention?" Look, on the day of your fast, you seek your own pleasure and exploit all your workers.
23:58:4/Indeed, you fast for conflict and quarreling, and to strike with a wicked fist. You cannot fast as you do today, hoping to make your voice heard on high.
23:58:5/Is this the kind of fast I have chosen? Only a day for people to humble themselves? Is it just for bowing one's head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?
23:58:6/Isn't this the fast I choose: to release the chains of injustice, to untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free, and to break every yoke?
23:58:7/Isn't it to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter—when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
23:58:8/Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.
23:58:9/Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here I am. If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,
23:58:10/And if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.
23:58:11/And the LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.
23:58:12/Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.
23:58:13/If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day; if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD's holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,
23:58:14/Then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will take you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23:59:1/Look, the LORD's hand isn't too short to save, nor is his ear too dull to hear.
23:59:2/But your wrongdoings have created a separation between you and your God, and your sins have made him hide his face from you, so that he won't listen.
23:59:3/Your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with wrongdoing; your lips have told lies, your tongue whispers deceit.
23:59:4/No one calls for justice, nor does anyone argue honestly: they rely on empty arguments and speak falsehoods; they plan harm and give birth to evil.
23:59:5/They hatch deadly eggs and spin webs of deceit: whoever eats their eggs dies, and when one is crushed, a viper comes out.
23:59:6/Their webs can't serve as clothing, nor can they cover themselves with what they make: their actions are actions of wrongdoing, and acts of violence are in their hands.
23:59:7/They rush into sin, eager to spill innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of wrongdoing; ruin and destruction are in their paths.
23:59:8/They don't know the way of peace; there's no fairness in their tracks: they've made their paths crooked; anyone who walks in them won't know peace.
23:59:9/That's why justice is far from us, and fairness doesn't reach us: we hope for light but find darkness; for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
23:59:10/We grope along the wall like the blind, we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at midday as in the twilight; among the strong, we're like the dead.
23:59:11/We all growl like bears, and moan sadly like doves: we hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it's far from us.
23:59:12/For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us: our offenses are with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities;
23:59:13/In rebelling and lying against the LORD, and turning away from our God, talking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart false words.
23:59:14/And justice is turned back, and righteousness stands at a distance; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and honesty cannot enter.
23:59:15/Yes, truth is missing; and whoever turns away from evil makes themselves a target: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
23:59:16/He saw that there was no one, and was astonished that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him.
23:59:17/He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
23:59:18/According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his adversaries, retribution to his enemies; to the islands he will repay retribution.
23:59:19/So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD will put him to flight.
23:59:20/And the Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, declares the LORD.
23:59:21/As for me, this is my covenant with them, says the LORD; My spirit that is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's offspring, says the LORD, from now on and forever.
23:60:1/Get up, shine; for your light has arrived, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
23:60:2/For, look, darkness will cover the earth, and deep darkness the people: but the LORD will rise upon you, and his glory will be seen on you.
23:60:3/And nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
23:60:4/Look around and see: everyone gathers and comes to you: your sons will come from afar, and your daughters will be carried at your side.
23:60:5/Then you will see and be radiant, and your heart will thrill and swell; because the wealth of the seas will be brought to you, the riches of nations will come to you.
23:60:6/A multitude of camels will cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all from Sheba will come: they will bring gold and frankincense; and they will proclaim the praises of the LORD.
23:60:7/All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve you: they will be accepted as offerings on my altar, and I will beautify my glorious temple.
23:60:8/Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like doves to their nests?
23:60:9/Indeed, the distant lands will wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and gold with them, to the name of the LORD your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he has made you glorious.
23:60:10/And foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you: for in my anger I struck you, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
23:60:11/Therefore your gates will always be open; they will not be shut day or night, so that people may bring you the wealth of nations, and their kings led in procession.
23:60:12/For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish; indeed, those nations will be utterly ruined.
23:60:13/The splendor of Lebanon will come to you, the juniper, the fir, and the cypress together, to adorn the place of my sanctuary; and I will glorify the place where my feet rest.
23:60:14/The descendants of those who oppressed you will come bowing to you; and all who despised you will bow down at your feet; and they will call you The City of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23:60:15/Whereas you have been abandoned and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, a joy from generation to generation.
23:60:16/You will also nurse on the milk of nations, and nurse at the breast of kings: and you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23:60:17/Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver, and instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron. I will also make your overseers peace, and your taskmasters righteousness.
23:60:18/Violence will no longer be heard in your land, nor devastation or destruction within your borders; but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
23:60:19/The sun will no longer be your light by day, nor for brightness will the moon give light to you: but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God your glory.
23:60:20/Your sun will no longer set, nor will your moon wane: for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be over.
23:60:21/Your people will all be righteous: they will possess the land forever, the shoot I have planted, the work of my hands, for the display of my splendor.
23:60:22/A small one will become a thousand, and a little one a strong nation: I, the LORD, will speed it up in its time.
23:61:1/The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the humble; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to declare freedom for the captives, and release from darkness for the prisoners;
23:61:2/To announce the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
23:61:3/To provide for those who grieve in Zion, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair; so they will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor.
23:61:4/They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.
23:61:5/Foreigners will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
23:61:6/But you will be called the Priests of the LORD; you will be named Ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast.
23:61:7/Instead of your shame you will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace you will rejoice in your inheritance. And so in your land, you will possess double the blessing; everlasting joy will be yours.
23:61:8/For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them.
23:61:9/Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the LORD has blessed.
23:61:10/I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul will exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23:61:11/For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up before all the nations.
23:62:1/For Zion's sake, I will not stay silent, and for Jerusalem's sake, I will not rest until its righteousness shines like the dawn, and its salvation blazes like a torch.
23:62:2/And the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be given a new name, which the LORD himself will announce.
23:62:3/You will be a splendid crown in the LORD's hand, and a royal headband in the hand of your God.
23:62:4/You will no longer be called Abandoned, nor will your land be called Wasteland. Instead, you will be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land will be united in marriage.
23:62:5/Just as a young man marries a maiden, so your children will marry you. And as a groom is happy with his bride, so your God will be full of joy over you.
23:62:6/I have placed guards on your walls, Jerusalem; they will not be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest,
23:62:7/And give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
23:62:8/The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies, and foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored."
23:62:9/But those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the sacred courts of my sanctuary.
23:62:10/Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations.
23:62:11/Indeed, the LORD has announced to the ends of the earth: "Tell the daughter of Zion, 'See, your salvation comes; see, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'"
23:62:12/And they will be called The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called Sought After, A city not abandoned.
23:63:1/Who is this coming from Edom, with clothes dyed from Bozrah? This one, glorious in his attire, moving in the greatness of his strength? I, who speak in righteousness, powerful to save.
23:63:2/Why are your clothes red, and your garments like those of someone who has been treading in the winepress?
23:63:3/I have pressed the grapes alone; no one was with me. For I will crush them in my anger, and stomp them in my rage; their blood will splash on my clothes, and I will stain all my clothing.
23:63:4/For the day of revenge is in my heart, and the time for my people to be freed has arrived.
23:63:5/And I looked, but there was no one to help; I was amazed that no one supported me. So my own arm achieved salvation for me; and my own rage supported me.
23:63:6/And I will stomp on the nations in my anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring their power down to the earth.
23:63:7/I will talk about the LORD's acts of kindness, and the praises of the LORD, for all that the LORD has given us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has given them according to his mercies, and according to the abundance of his acts of kindness.
23:63:8/For he said, Surely they are my people, children who will not deceive: so he became their Savior.
23:63:9/In all their distress, he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his compassion he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
23:63:10/But they rebelled, and grieved his Holy Spirit: so he turned against them as an enemy, and fought against them.
23:63:11/Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is the one who put his Holy Spirit in their midst?
23:63:12/Who led them with the right hand of Moses, with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make for himself an everlasting name?
23:63:13/Who led them through the depths, like a horse in the desert, so they did not stumble?
23:63:14/Like cattle that go down to the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So you led your people, to make for yourself a glorious name.
23:63:15/Look down from heaven, and see from your holy and glorious habitation. Where are your zeal and your might? The stirring of your heart and your compassion are held back from me.
23:63:16/Without a doubt, you are our father, even though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.
23:63:17/O LORD, why have you made us stray from your ways, and hardened our heart from fearing you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.
23:63:18/For a little while your holy people possessed your sanctuary, but now our enemies have trampled it down.
23:63:19/We belong to you. You never ruled over them; they were not called by your name.
23:64:1/Oh, if only you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence,
23:64:2/Just like when fire kindles brushwood and the fire makes water boil, to reveal your name to your enemies, so that nations would tremble before you!
23:64:3/When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.
23:64:4/From the beginning of time, no one has heard, nor has anyone perceived, nor has any eye seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
23:64:5/You meet those who joyfully do righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. But we sinned, and in your anger, you turned away, yet if we continue in your ways, we will be saved.
23:64:6/Yet we have all become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like a polluted garment; we all fade like a leaf, and our sins, like the wind, take us away.
23:64:7/No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins.
23:64:8/But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
23:64:9/Do not be exceedingly angry, O LORD, and do not remember our sins forever. Please look at us, for we are all your people.
23:64:10/Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
23:64:11/Our holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned with fire, and all our precious things have become ruins.
23:64:12/Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD? Will you keep silent and afflict us so severely?
23:65:1/I am sought by those who did not ask for me; I am found by those who did not seek me. I said, "Here I am, here I am," to a nation that did not call on my name.
23:65:2/I have reached out my hands all day long to a rebellious people, who walk in paths not good, following their own ideas;
23:65:3/A people who constantly provoke me to anger right to my face; who offer sacrifices in gardens, and burn incense on altars made of bricks; 
23:65:4/Who stay among the graves, and spend nights in secret places, who eat pork, and their pots hold broth of detestable things;
23:65:5/Who say, 'Keep away, don't come near me, for I am too sacred for you.' Such people are like smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day.
23:65:6/See, it is written before me: I will not keep silent but will repay, will indeed repay into their laps,
23:65:7/Both your sins and the sins of your ancestors," says the LORD. "Because they burned incense on the mountains and scorned me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds."
23:65:8/This is what the LORD says: "As when juice is found in a cluster of grapes and people say, 'Don't destroy it, there is a blessing in it,' so will I do for my servants' sake; I will not destroy them all.
23:65:9/I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen will inherit them, and my servants will live there.
23:65:10/Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me.
23:65:11/But as for you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
23:65:12/I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will fall in the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen; but you did what was evil in my eyes and chose what I did not delight in."
23:65:13/Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
23:65:14/My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from the anguish of your heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.
23:65:15/You will leave your name as a curse to my chosen ones, and the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.
23:65:16/Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.
23:65:17/See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
23:65:18/But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.
23:65:19/I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.
23:65:20/Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child; the one who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
23:65:21/They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23:65:22/No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.
23:65:23/They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them.
23:65:24/Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.
23:65:25/The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the LORD.
23:66:1/The LORD says, "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house could you build for me? Where would my resting place be?
23:66:2/For I have made all these things with my own hands, and they all belong to me, says the LORD. But I will pay attention to the one who is poor, humble, and respects my word.
23:66:3/Killing an ox is like murdering a person; sacrificing a lamb is like breaking a dog's neck; offering grain is like offering pig's blood; burning incense is like worshiping an idol. They have chosen their own paths, and their souls delight in their detestable practices.
23:66:4/So, I will also choose harsh treatment for them and bring their fears upon them. Because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.
23:66:5/Listen to the LORD's word, you who respect his word. Your own brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, so we can see your joy,' but they will be put to shame.
23:66:6/A sound of uproar from the city, a sound from the temple, the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies what they deserve.
23:66:7/Before she was in labor, she gave birth; before her pain came, she delivered a male child.
23:66:8/Who has ever heard of such things? Who has ever seen things like this? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
23:66:9/Would I bring to the moment of birth and not deliver?" says the LORD. "Would I, who cause to deliver, shut the womb?" says your God.
23:66:10/Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her; be delighted with her, all you who mourn over her.
23:66:11/So that you may nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breast; that you may drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance.
23:66:12/For this is what the LORD says: "I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
23:66:13/As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.
23:66:14/When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.
23:66:15/For behold, the LORD will come with fire and his chariots like a whirlwind, to execute his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire.
23:66:16/For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment on all people, and many will be those slain by the LORD.
23:66:17/Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, who eat pig's flesh, detestable things, and mice, will come to an end together, declares the LORD.
23:66:18/And I, knowing their actions and thoughts, am coming to gather all nations and languages. They will come and see my glory.
23:66:19/I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.
23:66:20/And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
23:66:21/And I will also take some of them as priests and Levites," says the LORD.
23:66:22/"For as the new heavens and the new earth that I will make will endure before me," declares the LORD, "so will your descendants and your name endure.
23:66:23/And it will happen that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all humanity will come to worship before me," says the LORD.
23:66:24/And they will go out and see the corpses of the men who have rebelled against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be abhorrent to all humanity.
24:1:1/The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
24:1:2/To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
24:1:3/It also came during the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, up to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, until the time Jerusalem was taken captive in the fifth month.
24:1:4/Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
24:1:5/Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.
24:1:6/Then I said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! I don't know how to speak; I'm too young."
24:1:7/But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I'm too young.' You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.
24:1:8/Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD.
24:1:9/Then the LORD reached out his hand, touched my mouth, and said to me, "I have put my words in your mouth.
24:1:10/See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant."
24:1:11/Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see a branch of an almond tree."
24:1:12/Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen correctly, for I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled."
24:1:13/And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, tilting away from the north."
24:1:14/Then the LORD said to me, "From the north disaster will be poured out on all the inhabitants of the land.
24:1:15/For I am about to summon all the clans of the kingdoms of the north," declares the LORD. "They will come and each will set up their throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah.
24:1:16/I will pronounce my judgments on them for all their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods, and in worshiping what their hands have made.
24:1:17/Therefore, prepare yourself and get up, and speak to them everything I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them.
24:1:18/For today, I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
24:1:19/They will fight against you, but they will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue you," declares the LORD.
24:2:1/Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24:2:2/Go and proclaim loudly to Jerusalem, saying, This is what the LORD says; I remember your early devotion, the love of your betrothal, when you followed me in the wilderness, in a land that was barren.
24:2:3/Israel was sacred to the LORD, the first of his harvest: anyone who harmed him would be guilty; disaster would come upon them, says the LORD.
24:2:4/Listen to the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel:
24:2:5/This is what the LORD says, What wrongdoing did your ancestors find in me, that they drifted away from me, and pursued emptiness, becoming empty themselves?
24:2:6/They did not ask, 'Where is the LORD who brought us out of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, through a land of drought and deep darkness, through a land that no one traveled, and where no one lived?'
24:2:7/And I brought you into a fertile land, to enjoy its fruit and its good things; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage detestable.
24:2:8/The priests did not ask, 'Where is the LORD?' Those who dealt with the law did not know me: the shepherds rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, following useless idols.
24:2:9/Therefore, I will still argue with you, says the LORD, and with your children's children I will argue.
24:2:10/Go across to the coasts of Cyprus and look; send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this.
24:2:11/Has a nation ever swapped its gods, (yet they are not gods at all)? Yet my people have exchanged their Glory for worthless idols.
24:2:12/Be appalled at this, you heavens, shudder with great horror, says the LORD.
24:2:13/For my people have committed two sins: They have abandoned me, the spring of living water, and they have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
24:2:14/Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?
24:2:15/The young lions have roared at him, they have growled, and they have made his land desolate; his cities are burned, without anyone living in them.
24:2:16/Even the people of Noph and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull.
24:2:17/Have you not brought this on yourself by forsaking the LORD your God when he led you in the way?
24:2:18/And now why do you journey to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or why do you journey to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
24:2:19/Your own wickedness will punish you, and your backsliding will rebuke you. Know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing for you to forsake the LORD your God, and the fear of me is not in you, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
24:2:20/Long ago I broke your yoke and tore off your chains; but you said, 'I will not serve.' Yet on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down as a prostitute.
24:2:21/Yet I had planted you as a choice vine, all of pure seed: how then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine to me?
24:2:22/Even though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, declares the Lord GOD.
24:2:23/How can you say, 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your behavior in the valley; understand what you have done: you are a swift young camel running here and there;
24:2:24/A wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving - in her mating season, who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at mating time they will find her.
24:2:25/Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It's hopeless: I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.'
24:2:26/Just as a thief is disgraced when caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced - they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets.
24:2:27/They say to wood, 'You are my father,' and to stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble, they say, 'Come and save us!'
24:2:28/But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them rise up if they can save you in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.
24:2:29/Why do you argue with me? You all have rebelled against me, says the LORD.
24:2:30/In vain I have struck your children; they accepted no discipline. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion.
24:2:31/O generation, see the word of the LORD. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of deep darkness? Why do my people say, 'We are free to roam; we will come to you no more'?
24:2:32/Can a young woman forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.
24:2:33/Why do you beautify your way to seek love? Therefore, you have also taught the wicked your ways.
24:2:34/Also on your skirts is found the blood of the innocent poor; you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things,
24:2:35/you say, 'I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will judge you because you say, 'I have not sinned.'
24:2:36/Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will also be disappointed by Egypt, as you were disappointed by Assyria.
24:2:37/From there you will go out with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not succeed with them.
24:3:1/People ask, "If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him to be with another man, can he take her back again? Wouldn't such an action defile the land? But you have been unfaithful with many lovers; yet I am willing to take you back, says the LORD."
24:3:2/Look up to the barren heights and see where you haven't been violated. You waited for them by the roadside like a nomad in the desert; you have defiled the land with your promiscuity and your wickedness.
24:3:3/That's why the rains have been withheld, and there has been no spring rain. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute; you refuse to be ashamed.
24:3:4/From now on, won't you call out to me, 'My Father, you are the guide of my youth?'
24:3:5/Will he hold onto his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end? Look, you have spoken and acted in evil ways as much as you could.
24:3:6/The LORD said to me during the reign of King Josiah, "Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has been unfaithful there.
24:3:7/And even after she had done all this, I thought she might return to me, but she did not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
24:3:8/I saw that for all the reasons faithless Israel had committed adultery, I had sent her away and given her a certificate of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid; she also went and was unfaithful.
24:3:9/Because of her casual promiscuity, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood.
24:3:10/And in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to me with all her heart, but only in pretense," says the LORD.
24:3:11/And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah.
24:3:12/Go, proclaim this message toward the north: 'Return, faithless Israel,' says the LORD, 'I will no longer look on you in anger, for I am merciful,' says the LORD, 'I will not be angry forever.
24:3:13/Only acknowledge your guilt—that you have rebelled against the LORD your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,'" says the LORD.
24:3:14/"Return, faithless people," says the LORD, "for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion.
24:3:15/And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.
24:3:16/And when you have increased and become fruitful in the land, in those days," says the LORD, "people will no longer talk about the ark of the covenant of the LORD. It will not come to mind or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made.
24:3:17/At that time they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
24:3:18/In those days the house of Judah will join the house of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I have given your ancestors as an inheritance.
24:3:19/But I said, 'How can I put you among the children and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful inheritance of the nations?' And I said, 'You will call me, My Father, and will not turn away from following me.'
24:3:20/Surely as a wife unfaithfully leaves her husband, so you have been unfaithful to me, O house of Israel," says the LORD.
24:3:21/A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and forgotten the LORD their God.
24:3:22/"Return, faithless people; I will cure you of backsliding." "Yes, we will come to you, for you are the LORD our God.
24:3:23/Indeed, the salvation of Israel is found in the LORD our God, not in the hills or mountains.
24:3:24/Shame has consumed the labor of our ancestors from our youth—their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.
24:3:25/We lie down in our shame, and our disgrace covers us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our ancestors, from our youth till this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
24:4:1/If you want to return, O Israel, says the LORD, come back to me: and if you're willing to remove your detestable acts from my sight, then you won't be forced to leave.
24:4:2/And you shall swear, "The LORD lives," in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations will bless themselves in him, and in him they will take pride.
24:4:3/For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your unplowed ground, and do not sow among thorns.
24:4:4/Dedicate yourselves to the LORD, and remove the hardness from your hearts, you men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem: or else my anger will flare up like fire, and burn with no one to extinguish it, because of the wickedness of your actions.
24:4:5/Announce in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem; and say, Sound the trumpet throughout the land: cry aloud, gather together, and say, Let's go into the fortified cities.
24:4:6/Raise the flag towards Zion: retreat, do not delay: for I will bring disaster from the north, and immense destruction.
24:4:7/The lion has left his den, and the destroyer of nations is on his way; he has set out from his place to make your land a wasteland; and your cities will be destroyed, left without any inhabitants.
24:4:8/For this, wear sackcloth, mourn and wail: for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us.
24:4:9/And it will happen on that day, says the LORD, that the heart of the king will fail, and the heart of the princes; and the priests will be shocked, and the prophets will be astounded.
24:4:10/Then I said, Ah, Sovereign LORD! You have truly misled this people and Jerusalem, by saying, "You will have peace," while the sword pierces to the soul.
24:4:11/At that time, it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows towards the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,
24:4:12/A wind too strong for that comes at my command; now I will pronounce judgment against them.
24:4:13/Behold, he will come up like clouds, and his chariots like a whirlwind: his horses are faster than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.
24:4:14/O Jerusalem, cleanse your heart from wickedness so you may be saved. How long will your harmful thoughts linger within you?
24:4:15/For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.
24:4:16/Inform the nations; indeed, announce against Jerusalem, that besiegers come from a distant land, and raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
24:4:17/They surround her like guards in a field, because she has rebelled against me, says the LORD.
24:4:18/Your own conduct and actions have brought this upon you; this is your punishment, and it is bitter, piercing to your heart.
24:4:19/My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the agony of my heart! My heart pounds within me; I cannot keep silent, for you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
24:4:20/Disaster follows disaster; the whole land lies in ruins. In an instant my tents are destroyed, my shelter in a moment.
24:4:21/How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
24:4:22/For my people are foolish, they do not know me; they are senseless children, and they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but do not know how to do good.
24:4:23/I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone.
24:4:24/I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying.
24:4:25/I looked, and there were no people; all the birds of the sky had fled.
24:4:26/I looked, and the fertile land was a desert; all its cities were torn down before the LORD, before his fierce anger.
24:4:27/For this is what the LORD says, The whole land will be desolate; yet I will not make a complete end.
24:4:28/Because of this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above grow dark; because I have spoken, I have planned, and I will not change my mind, nor will I turn back from it.
24:4:29/The whole city flees at the sound of the horsemen and archers. They go into thickets and climb up on the rocks; every city is abandoned, and no one lives in them.
24:4:30/And when you are plundered, what will you do? Though you dress in crimson, though you adorn yourself with jewels of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain you will make yourself beautiful; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.
24:4:31/For I have heard a cry as of a woman in labor, the anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, saying, "Alas for me now! For my soul is weary because of murderers."
24:5:1/Go through the streets of Jerusalem, look around, and understand, search its wide places to see if you can find anyone who acts justly, who seeks truth; and I will forgive it.
24:5:2/Even though they claim, "The LORD is alive," they are actually lying.
24:5:3/O LORD, don't you focus on truth? You have punished them, but they didn't mourn; you have wiped them out, but they refused to learn their lesson: they have become more stubborn than a rock; they have refused to turn back.
24:5:4/So I thought, these must be the poor; they are ignorant: for they don't understand the way of the LORD, or the justice of their God.
24:5:5/I will go to the leaders and speak to them; for they know the way of the LORD, and the justice of their God: but even they have completely broken off the yoke, and torn apart the chains.
24:5:6/Therefore, a lion from the forest will kill them, a wolf in the evening will destroy them, a leopard will lurk around their cities: anyone who leaves will be torn to pieces: because their wrongdoings are numerous, and their rebellions have increased.
24:5:7/How can I forgive you for this? Your children have abandoned me, and sworn by gods that are not real: when I had provided for them fully, they then committed adultery, and gathered in large numbers in the prostitutes’ houses.
24:5:8/They were like well-fed horses in the morning: each one lusted after his neighbor’s wife.
24:5:9/Shouldn't I punish these actions? says the LORD: and shouldn't I seek revenge on such a nation as this?
24:5:10/Climb up on her walls and destroy; but do not completely destroy: remove her defenses; for they do not belong to the LORD.
24:5:11/The house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me, says the LORD.
24:5:12/They have denied the LORD, and said, "He won't do anything; we won't face war or famine."
24:5:13/And the prophets will become like the wind, and the word is not in them: so it will be done to them.
24:5:14/Therefore, this is what the LORD God of hosts says, Because you have said this, watch, I will make my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and it will consume them.
24:5:15/Look, I will bring a nation against you from far away, O house of Israel, says the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.
24:5:16/Their quiver is like an open grave, they are all mighty warriors.
24:5:17/And they will consume your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and daughters should eat: they will consume your flocks and your herds: they will consume your vines and your fig trees: they will destroy with the sword your fortified cities, in which you trust.
24:5:18/Yet in those days, says the LORD, I will not completely destroy you.
24:5:19/And when you ask, "Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?" you shall answer them, "Just as you have abandoned me and served foreign gods in your own land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours."
24:5:20/Announce this in the house of Jacob, and proclaim it in Judah, saying,
24:5:21/Listen to this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear:
24:5:22/Aren't you afraid of me? says the LORD. Won't you tremble in my presence, who have set the sand as the boundary of the sea, by a perpetual decree, so it cannot pass it: and though its waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot cross it?
24:5:23/But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned away and gone.
24:5:24/They do not say in their heart, "Let us now fear the LORD our God, who gives rain, both the early and the late, in its season; he secures for us the appointed weeks of the harvest."
24:5:25/Your wrongdoings have turned these away, and your sins have kept good from you.
24:5:26/Among my people are found wicked men: they watch as one who sets snares; they set a trap, they catch people.
24:5:27/As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they have become great and grown rich.
24:5:28/They have grown fat and sleek: indeed, they surpass the deeds of the wicked: they do not plead the case, the case of the orphan, to make it prosper; and they do not defend the rights of the needy.
24:5:29/Shouldn't I punish these actions? says the LORD. Shouldn't I seek revenge on such a nation as this?
24:5:30/A shocking and horrible thing has happened in the land;
24:5:31/The prophets prophesy lies, and the priests rule by their own authority; and my people love it this way: but what will you do in the end?
24:6:1/You children of Benjamin, gather and flee from the center of Jerusalem, sound the trumpet in Tekoa, and light a beacon in Bethhaccerem: for danger looms from the north, bringing massive destruction.
24:6:2/I have compared the daughter of Zion to a beautiful and delicate woman.
24:6:3/Shepherds and their flocks will come to her; they will set up their tents all around her; they will graze each in his own area.
24:6:4/Get ready for battle against her; get up, let's attack at noon. Oh no! The day is fading, and the shadows of evening are getting longer.
24:6:5/Get up, let's move at night and destroy her palaces.
24:6:6/For this is what the LORD Almighty says, "Cut down trees and build a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression."
24:6:7/Just as a fountain spills out its waters, so she spills out her wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard within her; suffering and wounds are ever before me.
24:6:8/Let this be a warning to you, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you; I will make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.
24:6:9/This is what the LORD Almighty says, "They will thoroughly pick over the remnant of Israel as a vine; pass your hand again like a grape gatherer over the branches."
24:6:10/To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen? Behold, their ears are closed, and they cannot hear. See, the word of the LORD is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it.
24:6:11/Therefore, I am filled with the LORD's fury; I am tired of holding it in. I will pour it out on the children in the street and on the gathering of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be caught, as well as the elderly with those of advanced years.
24:6:12/Their houses will be turned over to others, along with their fields and wives, for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land," says the LORD.
24:6:13/For from the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit.
24:6:14/They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
24:6:15/Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to blush. Therefore, they will fall among those who fall; when I punish them, they will be brought down," says the LORD.
24:6:16/This is what the LORD says, "Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'"
24:6:17/I appointed watchmen over you and said, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not listen.'
24:6:18/Therefore, hear, you nations; be witness, assembly, to what will happen to them.
24:6:19/Hear, O earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law.
24:6:20/What is the point of bringing me incense from Sheba, and sweet cane from distant lands? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
24:6:21/Therefore, this is what the LORD says, "Behold, I will place obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish."
24:6:22/This is what the LORD says, "Look, an army is coming from the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24:6:23/They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. Their roar is like the sea as they ride on horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Zion."
24:6:24/We have heard reports about them; our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24:6:25/Do not go out into the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy's sword is everywhere and fear is on every side.
24:6:26/O daughter of my people, dress in sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn as for an only son, a bitter lament, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
24:6:27/I have made you a watchtower and a fortress among my people, so you can know and test their ways.
24:6:28/They are all stubborn rebels, going about with slander. They are bronze and iron; they all act corruptly.
24:6:29/The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the smelter refines, for the wicked are not removed.
24:6:30/They will be called worthless silver, because the LORD has rejected them.
24:7:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD was,
24:7:2/Stand at the entrance of the LORD's temple, and announce this message, saying, Listen to the word of the LORD, all you from Judah who enter these gates to worship the LORD.
24:7:3/This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Change your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place.
24:7:4/Don't be fooled by deceptive words, chanting, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.'
24:7:5/If you genuinely change your ways and your actions; if you truly administer justice between one person and another;
24:7:6/If you do not oppress the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, or follow other gods to your own harm,
24:7:7/Then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave to your ancestors forever and ever.
24:7:8/But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless.
24:7:9/Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods you have not known,
24:7:10/And then come and stand before me in this temple, which bears my name, and say, 'We are safe'—only to continue doing all these detestable acts?
24:7:11/Has this temple, which bears my name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching, declares the LORD.
24:7:12/Go now to my place in Shiloh, where I first made a dwelling for my name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
24:7:13/And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not listen; and I called you, but you did not answer,
24:7:14/Therefore, I will do to the temple that bears my name, in which you trust, and to the place I gave to you and your ancestors, just as I did to Shiloh.
24:7:15/And I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow countrymen, the entire offspring of Ephraim.
24:7:16/So do not pray for this people, do not offer any plea or petition for them, and do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you.
24:7:17/Don't you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24:7:18/The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger.
24:7:19/Do they provoke me to anger? declares the LORD. Do they not harm themselves, to their own shame?
24:7:20/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My anger and my fury will be poured out on this place—on humans and animals, on the trees of the field and the crops of the land—and it will burn and not be quenched.
24:7:21/This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat.
24:7:22/For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them about burnt offerings and sacrifices.
24:7:23/But I did command them this: Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Walk in all the ways I command you, so that it may go well with you.
24:7:24/But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward.
24:7:25/From the day your ancestors left Egypt until now, I have sent all my servants the prophets to you, again and again.
24:7:26/Yet they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.
24:7:27/Therefore, tell them all these words, but they will not listen to you; call to them, but they will not answer you.
24:7:28/But say to them, 'This is the nation that has not obeyed the LORD their God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips.
24:7:29/Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath.
24:7:30/For the people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the LORD. They have set up their detestable idols in the temple that bears my name and have defiled it.
24:7:31/They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind.
24:7:32/So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury in Topheth until there is no more room.
24:7:33/And the corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth, and no one will frighten them away.
24:7:34/Then I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of the bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.
24:8:1/At that time, says the LORD, they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem, from their graves:
24:8:2/And they will spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the stars, which they loved, served, followed, sought, and worshipped: they will not be collected or buried; they will be like waste on the ground.
24:8:3/And choosing death over life will be preferred by all who are left of this wicked family, wherever I have driven them, says the LORD of hosts.
24:8:4/Moreover, you should tell them, This is what the LORD says; If they fall, won't they get up? If someone turns away, won't they come back?
24:8:5/Why then has the people of Jerusalem turned away in constant backsliding? They cling to deceit and refuse to return.
24:8:6/I listened and heard, but they did not speak correctly: no one regretted their wickedness, asking, "What have I done?" Everyone turned to their own path, as a horse charges into battle.
24:8:7/Indeed, the stork in the sky knows her seasons; and the dove, the swift, and the crane keep the time of their return; but my people do not know the LORD's judgment.
24:8:8/How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But look, the making of it has been in vain; the scribes' work is useless.
24:8:9/The wise are put to shame, they are dismayed and caught: look, they have rejected the word of the LORD; so what wisdom do they have?
24:8:10/Therefore, I will give their wives to others, and their fields to new owners: because from the least to the greatest, everyone is greedy for gain; from the prophet to the priest, everyone deals falsely.
24:8:11/They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
24:8:12/Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush: therefore, they will fall among those who fall: at the time of their punishment, they will be brought down, says the LORD.
24:8:13/I will surely consume them, says the LORD: there will be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf will wither; and what I have given them will be taken away from them.
24:8:14/Why do we sit still? Gather together, and let's go into the fortified cities and be silent there: for the LORD our God has made us silent and given us bitter water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
24:8:15/We hoped for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror!
24:8:16/The sound of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his mighty ones; for they have come and devoured the land and everything in it; the city and those who live in it.
24:8:17/For, look, I will send venomous snakes among you, which cannot be charmed, and they will bite you, says the LORD.
24:8:18/When I try to comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint within me.
24:8:19/Listen to the cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land: "Isn't the LORD in Zion? Isn't her king there?" Why have they angered me with their carved images, and with foreign idols?
24:8:20/The harvest is over, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.
24:8:21/For the injury of the daughter of my people, I am injured; I mourn; dismay has taken hold of me.
24:8:22/Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?
24:9:1/I wish my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears, so I could cry day and night for the slain of my people!
24:9:2/I wish I had a traveler's shelter in the desert, so I could leave my people and go away from them! They are all adulterers, a group of traitors.
24:9:3/They twist their words like a bow for lies: they don't stand up for the truth on earth; they go from one evil to another and they don't know me, says the LORD.
24:9:4/Be careful of your neighbor, and don't trust any brother: every brother will completely betray, and every neighbor will go around spreading rumors.
24:9:5/They will deceive each other and refuse to tell the truth: they've trained their tongues to lie, and exhaust themselves committing wrongdoing.
24:9:6/You live among deception; through deceit they refuse to know me, says the LORD.
24:9:7/Therefore, this is what the LORD of hosts says, I will refine them and test them; for what else can I do because of my people?
24:9:8/Their tongue is like a sharp arrow; it speaks deceit: someone speaks peacefully to their neighbor with their mouth, but in their heart, they set a trap.
24:9:9/Shouldn't I punish them for these things? says the LORD. Shouldn't I take revenge on such a nation as this?
24:9:10/I will weep for the mountains and wail for the desert pastures, because they are scorched, so no one can pass through; no one can hear the sound of the cattle; both the birds of the sky and the animals have fled; they are gone.
24:9:11/And I will turn Jerusalem into ruins, a home for dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah empty, without an inhabitant.
24:9:12/Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land perished and been scorched like a desert that no one can cross?
24:9:13/And the LORD says, Because they have abandoned my law which I set before them, and have not listened to my voice or walked in it;
24:9:14/But have followed the stubbornness of their own hearts and the Baals, as their fathers taught them;
24:9:15/Therefore, this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; Look, I will feed this people with bitterness and give them poisonous water to drink.
24:9:16/I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will send the sword after them until I have destroyed them.
24:9:17/This is what the LORD of hosts says, Consider and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skilled women to come;
24:9:18/And let them hurry and raise a wail over us, so that our eyes overflow with tears and our eyelids stream with water.
24:9:19/For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion, 'How we are ruined! We are utterly ashamed, because we have left the land, because our homes have thrown us out.'
24:9:20/Yet listen to the word of the LORD, O women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; teach your daughters how to wail, and each one her neighbor a lament.
24:9:21/For death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our palaces, to eliminate the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.
24:9:22/Say, 'This is what the LORD declares, "Even the bodies of men will fall like dung on the open field, like cut wheat behind the reaper, with no one to gather them."'
24:9:23/This is what the LORD says, 'Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches,
24:9:24/But let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,' says the LORD.
24:9:25/'Behold, the days are coming,' says the LORD, 'when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—
24:9:26/Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all those with shaved temples who live in the desert. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.'
24:10:1/Listen to the message the LORD has for you, people of Israel:
24:10:2/This is what the LORD says: Do not adopt the customs of the non-believers, and do not be terrified by the celestial signs as they are.
24:10:3/The practices of the people are pointless: someone cuts down a tree from the forest, crafted by the skill of a craftsman with an axe.
24:10:4/They decorate it with silver and gold; they secure it with nails and hammers so it won't fall over.
24:10:5/They stand tall like palm trees but cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can't cause harm, nor can they do any good.
24:10:6/For there is no one like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is mighty in power.
24:10:7/Who would not revere you, O King of nations? Indeed, it is your due: among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.
24:10:8/But they are completely senseless and foolish; their teachings are nothing but nonsense.
24:10:9/Silver beaten into plates is imported from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, crafted by artisans and goldsmiths; they wear blue and purple garments, all the work of skilled craftsmen.
24:10:10/But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the eternal king. When he is angry, the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his fury.
24:10:11/Tell them this: The gods who did not create the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.
24:10:12/He made the earth by his power, established the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24:10:13/When he speaks, the waters in the heavens roar, and he brings clouds from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24:10:14/Every person is senseless in their knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by their idols, for their cast images are false, and there is no breath in them.
24:10:15/They are worthless, a work of mockery; when their time comes, they will perish.
24:10:16/The portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; The LORD of hosts is his name.
24:10:17/Collect your belongings from the land, you who live under siege.
24:10:18/For this is what the LORD says: Look, I will throw out the inhabitants of the land at this time and will bring distress on them so they may feel it.
24:10:19/Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is severe. But I thought, "This is surely my suffering, and I must endure it."
24:10:20/My dwelling is destroyed; all my ropes are snapped. My children have left me, and they are no more; there is no one to pitch my tent anymore or to set up my curtains.
24:10:21/For the shepherds have become senseless and have not sought the LORD; therefore, they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.
24:10:22/Listen, the report is coming—a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the cities of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals.
24:10:23/O LORD, I understand that a person's way is not in themselves; it is not in one's power to direct their steps.
24:10:24/O LORD, correct me, but with justice; not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing.
24:10:25/Unleash your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the families that do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and ruined his homeland.
24:11:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD was,
24:11:2/Listen to the words of this covenant, and tell them to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem;
24:11:3/And tell them, This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is the person who does not obey the terms of this covenant,
24:11:4/Which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, saying, Listen to my voice and follow all that I command you. Then you will be my people, and I will be your God,
24:11:5/So that I can fulfill the promise I made to your ancestors, to give them a land rich with milk and honey, as it is today. Then I responded, "Amen, LORD."
24:11:6/Then the LORD told me, Announce all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them.
24:11:7/For I strongly warned your ancestors when I brought them up from Egypt, and I have continued to warn them to this day, saying, Listen to my voice.
24:11:8/Yet they did not listen or pay attention but followed their own desires and wicked hearts. Therefore, I will bring upon them all the terms of this covenant, which I commanded them to follow but they did not.
24:11:9/And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy has been found among the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
24:11:10/They have returned to the sins of their ancestors who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors.
24:11:11/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am bringing disaster on them that they cannot escape. Even if they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.
24:11:12/Then the cities of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods they burn incense to, but those gods will not save them at all in their time of trouble.
24:11:13/For as many as your cities are, so are your gods, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem, you have set up altars to shameful idols, altars to burn incense to Baal.
24:11:14/So do not pray for these people, nor offer any plea or petition for them, for I will not listen when they call to me in their distress.
24:11:15/What right does my beloved have in my house when she has engaged in many vile deeds? Can vows and sacred meat prevent your disaster? When you engage in your wickedness, then you rejoice.
24:11:16/The LORD once called you a thriving olive tree, beautiful with good fruit. But with a great roar, he has set it on fire, and its branches are broken.
24:11:17/For the LORD of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you because of the evil the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done to themselves, provoking me by burning incense to Baal.
24:11:18/And the LORD has made it known to me, and I know it; then you showed me their actions.
24:11:19/But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying, "Let's destroy the tree and its fruit; let's cut him off from the land of the living, so his name will be forgotten."
24:11:20/But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24:11:21/Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the men of Anathoth who are seeking your life and saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD or you will die by our hands":
24:11:22/This is what the LORD of hosts says: I will punish them. The young men will die by the sword; their sons and daughters will die by famine.
24:11:23/And there will be no survivors for them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.
24:12:1/You are just, O LORD, when I bring my case before you. Yet, let me discuss your decisions: Why do the wicked thrive? Why are all those who are deceitful happy?
24:12:2/You have planted them, and they have taken root: they grow and bear fruit. You are on their lips but far from their hearts.
24:12:3/But you, O LORD, know me; you see me and test my heart toward you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered, set them aside for the day of slaughter.
24:12:4/How long will the land grieve, and the plants of every field dry up, because of the evil of its inhabitants? The animals and birds are perishing because they think, 'He will not see our final end.'
24:12:5/If you have raced with people and they have worn you out, then how can you compete with horses? And if you stumble in a safe land, what will you do in the treacherous Jordan floodplains?
24:12:6/Even your own brothers and your father's household have betrayed you. They have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, even though they speak kindly to you.
24:12:7/I have abandoned my house, I have deserted my inheritance; I have handed over the love of my life to her enemies.
24:12:8/My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest; it roars against me, therefore I have come to hate it.
24:12:9/My inheritance is like a colorful bird attacked by other birds; come, gather all the wild beasts, bring them to devour.
24:12:10/Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard, they have trampled down my field, they have turned my prized possession into a desolate wasteland.
24:12:11/They have made it a wasteland, desolate, it mourns to me. The whole land is made desolate because no one takes it to heart.
24:12:12/Invaders have come to all the barren heights in the wilderness; for the sword of the LORD will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will have peace.
24:12:13/They have planted wheat but will harvest thorns. They have toiled to no avail and will be disappointed by their harvests because of the LORD's fierce anger.
24:12:14/This is what the LORD says against all my evil neighbors who encroach on the inheritance I have given my people Israel: "Look, I will uproot them from their land and uproot the house of Judah from among them.
24:12:15/And after I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance, to their own land.
24:12:16/And if they diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, 'As the LORD lives,' just as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be established among my people.
24:12:17/But if they do not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy that nation," declares the LORD.
24:13:1/The LORD said to me, "Go and buy a linen belt, and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water."
24:13:2/So I bought a belt as the LORD instructed, and wore it around my waist.
24:13:3/Then the LORD spoke to me again,
24:13:4/"Take the belt you have bought, which is around your waist, and go to the Euphrates. Hide it there in a crevice in the rocks."
24:13:5/So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, just as the LORD had commanded me.
24:13:6/After a long time, the LORD said to me, "Go back to the Euphrates and retrieve the belt I told you to hide there."
24:13:7/So I went to the Euphrates, dug up the belt from where I had hidden it, and found that it was ruined and completely useless.
24:13:8/Then the LORD spoke to me, saying,
24:13:9/"This is how I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem."
24:13:10/"These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow their own desires, and who worship and serve other gods, will be like this belt—completely useless."
24:13:11/"Just as a belt clings to a person's waist, I brought the entire house of Israel and the entire house of Judah close to me," declares the LORD, "so they could be my people, for renown, praise, and honor. But they did not listen."
24:13:12/"Therefore, tell them this word; 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every jar will be filled with wine.' And they will say to you, 'Don't we already know that every jar will be filled with wine?'"
24:13:13/"Then tell them, 'This is what the LORD says: I will fill all the inhabitants of this land with drunkenness—including the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the residents of Jerusalem.'"
24:13:14/"I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike," declares the LORD. "I will show no compassion, nor will I spare or have mercy. I will destroy them."
24:13:15/"Listen and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken."
24:13:16/"Honor the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before you stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it into deep shadow, making it pitch dark."
24:13:17/"But if you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the LORD's flock will be taken captive."
24:13:18/"Tell the king and the queen mother to humble themselves, for their exalted positions will be brought down, the crown of their glory will fall."
24:13:19/"The cities of the south will be locked up, and no one will open them. Judah will be exiled, completely taken away."
24:13:20/"Look up and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, your beautiful sheep?"
24:13:21/"What will you say when your allies, whom you yourself have trained, turn against you? Will not pain seize you like a woman in labor?"
24:13:22/"And if you wonder in your heart why these things have happened to you—it's because of your great sin that your skirts have been lifted up and you have been violated."
24:13:23/"Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Likewise, can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil?"
24:13:24/"Therefore, I will scatter you like chaff that is blown away by the desert wind."
24:13:25/"This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you," declares the LORD, "because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies."
24:13:26/"Therefore, I will expose your skirts over your face, that your shame may be seen."
24:13:27/"I have seen your adulteries and your lustful neighs, the lewdness of your prostitution on the hills and in the fields. How long will you remain unclean, O Jerusalem?"
24:14:1/The message from the LORD that came to Jeremiah about the drought.
24:14:2/Judah is in mourning, its gates are weakened; they have turned dark to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem has risen.
24:14:3/And their leaders have sent their young ones to fetch water: they went to the wells and found no water; they returned with their containers empty; they were embarrassed and dismayed, and covered their heads.
24:14:4/Because the soil is cracked, due to no rain on the land, the farmers were embarrassed, they covered their heads.
24:14:5/Indeed, the deer also gave birth in the field, and abandoned it because there was no grass.
24:14:6/And the wild donkeys stood on the barren heights, they gasped for air like dragons; their eyes failed because there was no grass.
24:14:7/O LORD, although our wrongdoings testify against us, act for the sake of your name: for our backsliding is extensive; we have sinned against you.
24:14:8/O the hope of Israel, the savior in times of distress, why should you be like a stranger in the land, and like a traveler who stops just to spend the night?
24:14:9/Why should you be like a stunned man, like a warrior who cannot save? Yet you, O LORD, are among us, and we bear your name; do not abandon us.
24:14:10/This is what the LORD says to these people, They have loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet, therefore the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their wrongdoing, and punish their sins.
24:14:11/Then the LORD said to me, Do not pray for the well-being of this people.
24:14:12/When they fast, I will not listen to their plea; and when they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine, and plague.
24:14:13/Then I said, Ah, Sovereign LORD! The prophets are telling them, You will not see the sword or suffer famine; indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.
24:14:14/Then the LORD said to me, The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries, and the deceit of their own minds.
24:14:15/Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they say, 'Sword and famine will not touch this land.' By sword and famine those prophets will be consumed.
24:14:16/And the people to whom they prophesy will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. They will have no one to bury them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will pour out on them their own wickedness.
24:14:17/Therefore, you must say this word to them; Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people has been struck with a great wound, with a very harsh blow.
24:14:18/If I go out into the field, then behold, those slain by the sword! And if I enter the city, then behold, those sick with famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade throughout the land and have no knowledge.
24:14:19/Have you completely rejected Judah? Does your soul loathe Zion? Why have you struck us down so there is no healing for us? We hoped for peace, but no good has come; for a time of healing, but behold, terror!
24:14:20/We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness and the iniquity of our ancestors; for we have sinned against you.
24:14:21/Do not despise us, for your own name's sake; do not dishonor your glorious throne. Remember, do not break your covenant with us.
24:14:22/Are there any among the worthless idols of the nations that can bring rain? Or can the heavens themselves send showers? Are you not he, O LORD our God? Therefore, we will wait for you, for you have made all these things.
24:15:1/Then the LORD said to me, "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, my heart would not turn towards these people. Send them away from my presence and let them go.
24:15:2/And if they ask you, 'Where should we go?' you should tell them, 'This is what the LORD says: Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for famine, to famine; and those for captivity, to captivity.'
24:15:3/I will summon four kinds of destroyers against them, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the birds of the sky to feast, and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
24:15:4/I will scatter them among all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
24:15:5/Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will turn aside to ask how you are doing?
24:15:6/You have abandoned me, declares the LORD, you have gone backwards. So, I will stretch out my hand against you and destroy you; I am tired of holding back.
24:15:7/I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they do not turn from their ways.
24:15:8/The number of their widows will surpass the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mothers of their young men, a destroyer at midday; I will suddenly bring down upon them anguish and terror.
24:15:9/The woman who bore seven sons pines away; she breathes her last; her sun sets while it is still day; she is shamed and disgraced. And the rest I will hand over to the sword in the presence of their enemies, declares the LORD.
24:15:10/Alas, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man of conflict and strife for the whole world! I have not lent or borrowed, yet everyone curses me.
24:15:11/The LORD said, "Surely I will ensure your welfare; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress.
24:15:12/Can iron break iron from the north, or bronze?
24:15:13/Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without cost, for all your sins, throughout all your territory.
24:15:14/And I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for my anger has kindled a fire that will burn against you."
24:15:15/O LORD, you know; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. Do not take me away in your long-suffering. Know that for your sake I endure scorn.
24:15:16/When I discovered your words, I devoured them; they were my joy and my heart's delight, for I bear your name, O LORD God of hosts.
24:15:17/I never sat with the mockers to enjoy myself; I sat alone because of your hand upon me, for you filled me with indignation.
24:15:18/Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? Will you be to me like a deceptive brook, like waters that fail?
24:15:19/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: "If you return, I will restore you, and you will stand before me. If you separate the precious from the worthless, you will be my spokesman. Let them turn to you, but you must not turn to them.
24:15:20/And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save and deliver you, declares the LORD.
24:15:21/And I will rescue you from the grasp of the wicked and redeem you from the grip of the ruthless."
24:16:1/The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,
24:16:2/Do not take a wife for yourself, nor have sons or daughters in this place.
24:16:3/For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters born in this place, and about their mothers who gave birth to them, and their fathers who fathered them in this land;
24:16:4/They will die from terrible deaths; they will not be mourned or buried; instead, they will be like waste on the ground: and they will be killed by the sword and by famine; and their bodies will be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.
24:16:5/For this is what the LORD says, Do not enter the house of mourning, do not go to grieve or lament for them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, says the LORD, including my love and compassion.
24:16:6/Both the great and the small will die in this land: they will not be buried, no one will mourn for them, cut themselves, or shave their heads for them;
24:16:7/No one will tear their clothes in mourning to comfort them for the dead; no one will offer them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
24:16:8/You must also not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
24:16:9/For this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; Look, I will eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the sounds of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
24:16:10/And when you tell this people all these things, and they ask you, 'Why has the LORD declared all this great disaster against us? What have we done wrong? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?'
24:16:11/Then you will tell them, 'Because your ancestors abandoned me,' says the LORD, 'and followed other gods, served and worshiped them, abandoned me and did not keep my law;
24:16:12/And you have acted worse than your ancestors; for, see, each of you follows the stubbornness of your evil heart, refusing to listen to me:
24:16:13/Therefore, I will throw you out of this land into a land you do not know, neither you nor your ancestors; and there you will serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favor.'
24:16:14/Therefore, look, the days are coming,' says the LORD, 'when it will no longer be said, 'The LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;'
24:16:15/But, 'The LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them: and I will bring them back into their land that I gave to their ancestors.'
24:16:16/Behold, I will send for many fishermen,' says the LORD, 'and they will fish for them; and afterwards, I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
24:16:17/For my eyes are on all their ways: they are not hidden from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
24:16:18/And first I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the corpses of their detestable and abominable idols.
24:16:19/O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of trouble, the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say, 'Surely our ancestors inherited nothing but lies, worthless things in which there is no profit.
24:16:20/Can a person make gods for themselves, which are not gods?
24:16:21/Therefore, see, I will make them know, this time I will make them know my power and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.
24:17:1/Judah's sin is permanently marked with an iron pen and a diamond point; it's deeply engraved on their hearts and on the altars' horns.
24:17:2/While their children remember their altars and sacred groves near the green trees on the high hills.
24:17:3/Oh, my mountain in the field, I will surrender your wealth and all your treasures to be plundered, and your high places for sin, across your entire territory.
24:17:4/And you will lose the heritage I gave you; I will make you serve your enemies in a foreign land because you have ignited my anger, which will burn forever.
24:17:5/This is what the LORD says: Cursed is the person who trusts in humans, relies on physical strength, and turns their heart away from the LORD.
24:17:6/He will be like a shrub in the desert, not knowing when relief comes; he will live in the dry wilderness, in an uninhabited salty land.
24:17:7/Blessed is the person who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in the LORD.
24:17:8/He will be like a tree planted by the water, extending its roots to the stream. It won't fear when heat comes; its leaves will stay green. It won't worry in a year of drought and never stops producing fruit.
24:17:9/The heart is more deceitful than anything else and is terribly corrupt. Who can understand it?
24:17:10/I, the LORD, examine the heart and test the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their actions deserve.
24:17:11/Just as a partridge that broods over eggs it didn't lay, so is the person who gains wealth unjustly; in the middle of their days, it will leave them, and in the end, they will be a fool.
24:17:12/A glorious high throne from the beginning is our holy place.
24:17:13/O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who abandon you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the LORD, the source of living waters.
24:17:14/Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for you are my praise.
24:17:15/See, they keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now."
24:17:16/As for me, I haven't rushed away from being a shepherd following you. I haven't longed for the day of disaster, you know what I've spoken, it was in your presence.
24:17:17/Don't be a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
24:17:18/Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but keep me from shame; let them be terrified, but don't let me be terrified. Bring upon them the day of disaster and destroy them with double destruction.
24:17:19/This is what the LORD said to me: "Go and stand at the gate where the people's children enter, and where the kings of Judah come in and out, and at all the gates of Jerusalem.
24:17:20/And tell them, 'Listen to the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, all of Judah, and all the residents of Jerusalem who enter these gates:
24:17:21/This is what the LORD says: Be careful, and do not carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem.
24:17:22/Do not take a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors.
24:17:23/But they did not listen or pay attention; they were stubborn and would not listen or accept discipline.
24:17:24/If you listen to me carefully, says the LORD, and bring no load through the city gates on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it,
24:17:25/then kings and officials who sit on David's throne will enter the gates of this city, riding in chariots and on horses, along with their officials, the people of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem. And this city will remain forever.
24:17:26/People will come from the cities of Judah, the areas around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, the lowlands, the hills, and the south, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, and incense, and bringing thanksgiving sacrifices to the house of the LORD.
24:17:27/But if you do not listen to me to keep the Sabbath day holy and not to carry a load and enter the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will ignite a fire in its gates, and it will consume the palaces of Jerusalem and not be extinguished.
24:18:1/The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD was,
24:18:2/Get up, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words.
24:18:3/So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was, working on the wheel.
24:18:4/And the pot he was shaping from the clay was spoiled in his hands; so he formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.
24:18:5/Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24:18:6/O house of Israel, can't I do with you as this potter does? declares the LORD. Look, as clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
24:18:7/Whenever I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed,
24:18:8/But if that nation I warned turns from its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned.
24:18:9/And whenever I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted,
24:18:10/But if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.
24:18:11/Now therefore, say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'This is what the LORD says: Look, I am planning disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.'
24:18:12/But they said, 'It's hopeless: we will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of our evil heart.'
24:18:13/Therefore this is what the LORD says: Inquire among the nations: Who has heard of such things? The virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
24:18:14/Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever stop flowing?
24:18:15/Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, leaving the ancient paths to walk in bypaths, not on a highway,
24:18:16/Making their land desolate, an object of perpetual scorn; everyone who passes by it will be shocked and shake their head.
24:18:17/I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster.
24:18:18/Then they said, 'Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching will not be lost from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.'
24:18:19/Pay attention to me, O LORD, and listen to what my adversaries are saying.
24:18:20/Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before you to speak good on their behalf, to turn away your wrath from them.
24:18:21/Therefore, hand their children over to famine; give them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
24:18:22/Let a cry be heard from their houses when you bring an army suddenly upon them. For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.
24:18:23/Yet, LORD, you know all their plans to kill me. Do not forgive their crime or blot out their sin from your sight. Let them be tripped up before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.
24:19:1/The LORD says, "Go and get a potter's clay jar, and gather some of the elders of the people and the senior priests.
24:19:2/Then head to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the east gate, and there announce the message I will give you.
24:19:3/And say, 'Listen to the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem; the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to bring disaster on this place, and it will be so severe that it will make everyone's ears ring who hears about it.
24:19:4/Because they have abandoned me and have made this place foreign, burning incense here to other gods that neither they, their ancestors, nor the kings of Judah have known, and have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
24:19:5/They have also built high places for Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal, something I did not command or mention, nor did it ever enter my mind.
24:19:6/Therefore, the time is coming, declares the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
24:19:7/I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and at the hands of those who seek their lives; and I will give their corpses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
24:19:8/And I will turn this city into ruins and an object of scorn; everyone who passes by will be shocked and scoff at all its wounds.
24:19:9/I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat each other's flesh during the siege and distress inflicted by their enemies who seek their lives.
24:19:10/Then you shall break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you,
24:19:11/And you shall say to them, 'This is what the LORD of hosts says: I will shatter this people and this city, just as one shatters a potter's jar that cannot be repaired. And they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
24:19:12/This is what I will do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth:
24:19:13/And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place of Topheth—all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.'
24:19:14/Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD's house and said to all the people,
24:19:15/'This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to bring on this city and all its towns all the disaster I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their necks, refusing to listen to my words.'
24:20:1/Now Pashur, the son of Immer the priest, who was also the chief official in the LORD's temple, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
24:20:2/Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks at the high gate of Benjamin, near the LORD's temple.
24:20:3/The next day, Pashur released Jeremiah from the stocks. Jeremiah then said to him, "The LORD has not named you Pashur, but Magormissabib."
24:20:4/For this is what the LORD says, "I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies while you watch. I will hand all of Judah over to the king of Babylon. He will take them captive to Babylon and kill them with the sword."
24:20:5/I will also hand over the strength of this city, all its hard work, its valuable possessions, and the treasures of the kings of Judah to their enemies. They will plunder them, take them, and carry them off to Babylon.
24:20:6/And you, Pashur, along with everyone in your household, will be taken captive to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have lied."
24:20:7/O LORD, you have misled me, and I allowed myself to be misled. You are stronger than I, and you have prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me.
24:20:8/Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the LORD has brought me insult and reproach all day long.
24:20:9/But if I say, "I will not mention him or speak any more in his name," his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot.
24:20:10/I hear many whispering, "Terror on every side! Report him! Let's report him!" All my close friends are waiting for me to slip, saying, "Perhaps he will be deceived; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him."
24:20:11/But the LORD is with me like a mighty warrior; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced; their dishonor will never be forgotten.
24:20:12/O LORD Almighty, you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24:20:13/Sing to the LORD! Give praise to the LORD! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked.
24:20:14/Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother gave birth to me not be blessed.
24:20:15/Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, saying, "A child is born to you—a son!" making him very happy.
24:20:16/May that man be like the towns the LORD overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon.
24:20:17/For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb eternally pregnant.
24:20:18/Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?
24:21:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Zedekiah sent Pashur son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, to ask him,
24:21:2/"Please inquire of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is waging war against us. Perhaps the LORD will act on our behalf with his miraculous deeds, so that he will withdraw from us."
24:21:3/Then Jeremiah said to them, "This is what you should tell Zedekiah:
24:21:4/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I am about to turn the weapons of war in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls, and I will gather them inside this city.
24:21:5/And I myself will fight against you with a stretched-out hand and with a strong arm, in anger, fury, and great wrath.
24:21:6/And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both people and animals; they will die of a severe plague.
24:21:7/After that, says the LORD, I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword, and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, into the hands of their enemies, and those who want to kill them. He will strike them down with the sword; he will not spare them, nor will he show pity or mercy.'
24:21:8/And to this people you shall say, 'This is what the LORD says: I present to you the choice of life or death.
24:21:9/Anyone who stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, or plague. But anyone who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their life.
24:21:10/For I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, says the LORD. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.'
24:21:11/Regarding the royal house of Judah, hear the word of the LORD;
24:21:12/'O house of David, this is what the LORD says: Administer justice every morning, and rescue the victim from the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire and burn with none to quench it, because of your evil deeds.'
24:21:13/Behold, I am against you, resident of the valley, rock of the plain, says the LORD. You who say, 'Who will come down against us? Or who will enter our dwellings?'
24:21:14/But I will punish you according to the outcome of your actions, says the LORD. I will ignite a fire in its forest, and it will consume everything around it."
24:22:1/The LORD says; Go down to the palace of the king of Judah, and deliver this message there,
24:22:2/And tell him, Listen to the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, you who sit on David's throne, you, your officials, and your people who enter through these gates:
24:22:3/The LORD says; Carry out justice and righteousness, rescue the plundered from the hands of their oppressor: do not mistreat or do violence to the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.
24:22:4/If you truly do this, then kings who sit on David's throne will enter through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, along with their servants and their people.
24:22:5/But if you do not listen to these words, I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that this palace will become a ruin.
24:22:6/For this is what the LORD says to the royal house of Judah; You are like Gilead to me, the summit of Lebanon, yet I will surely turn you into a desert, into cities without inhabitants.
24:22:7/And I will send destroyers against you, each armed for battle: they will chop down your finest cedars and throw them into the fire.
24:22:8/Many nations will pass by this city and each will ask his neighbor, Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?
24:22:9/And the answer will be, Because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped and served other gods.
24:22:10/Do not weep for the dead or mourn for them; weep bitterly for the one who is exiled, for he will never return nor see his homeland again.
24:22:11/For this is what the LORD says about Shallum son of Josiah king of Judah, who succeeded Josiah his father as king and who has left this place; He will never return here,
24:22:12/But he will die in the place where they have exiled him and will never see this land again.
24:22:13/Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness and his upper rooms by injustice, making his countrymen work for nothing, not paying them for their labor;
24:22:14/He says, 'I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.' So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar, and paints it with vermilion.
24:22:15/Do you think you are more royal because you compete in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and administer justice and righteousness? Then it went well with him.
24:22:16/He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me? declares the LORD.
24:22:17/But your eyes and heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood, on oppression and on violence to carry it out.
24:22:18/Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah; They will not mourn for him, saying, 'Alas, my brother!' or 'Alas, sister!' They will not mourn for him, saying, 'Alas, master!' or 'Alas, his majesty!'
24:22:19/He will have the burial of a donkey—dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
24:22:20/Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are shattered.
24:22:21/I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, 'I will not listen.' This has been your way from your youth, that you have not obeyed my voice.
24:22:22/The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into exile. Surely then you will be ashamed and disgraced for all your wickedness.
24:22:23/O inhabitant of Lebanon, nestled among the cedars, how you will groan when pains come upon you, agony like that of a woman in labor!
24:22:24/As surely as I live, declares the LORD, even if Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off;
24:22:25/And I will hand you over to those who seek your life, to those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians.
24:22:26/I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into another country, where you were not born, and there you both will die.
24:22:27/But to the land to which they long to return, there they will not return.
24:22:28/Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot, a vessel no one cares for? Why are they thrown out, he and his descendants, and cast into a land they do not know?
24:22:29/O earth, earth, earth, listen to the word of the LORD.
24:22:30/This is what the LORD says, Record this man as childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime: for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.
24:23:1/Doom to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture! declares the LORD.
24:23:2/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my flock, driven them away, and not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil actions, declares the LORD.
24:23:3/I will gather the remnants of my flock from all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pastures, where they will be fruitful and multiply.
24:23:4/I will appoint shepherds over them who will tend to them. They will no longer be afraid, dismayed, or missing, declares the LORD.
24:23:5/Behold, the time is coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up a righteous Branch from David's line, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.
24:23:6/In his days, Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
24:23:7/Therefore, behold, the time is coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer say, 'The LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,'
24:23:8/But, 'The LORD lives, who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel out of the northern land and from all the countries where I had banished them,' so they will live in their own land.
24:23:9/My heart is broken within me because of the prophets; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and his holy words.
24:23:10/The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land mourns, the pastures in the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right.
24:23:11/Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness, declares the LORD.
24:23:12/Therefore, their path will be slippery in the darkness; they will be driven on and fall in it. For I will bring disaster on them, the year of their punishment, declares the LORD.
24:23:13/I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
24:23:14/And in the prophets of Jerusalem, I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.
24:23:15/Therefore, this is what the LORD of hosts says about the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink. For from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.
24:23:16/This is what the LORD of hosts says: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
24:23:17/They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The LORD says: You will have peace.' And to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his heart, they say, 'No harm will come to you.'
24:23:18/But who has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word?
24:23:19/Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
24:23:20/The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart. In the latter days, you will understand it clearly.
24:23:21/I did not send these prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
24:23:22/But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from the evil of their deeds.
24:23:23/Am I only a God nearby, declares the LORD, and not a God far away?
24:23:24/Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD.
24:23:25/I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, claiming, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'
24:23:26/How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds?
24:23:27/They think they can make my people forget my name by their dreams, which they tell one another, just as their ancestors forgot my name for Baal.
24:23:28/The prophet who has a dream may share his dream, but the one who has my word should speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with grain? declares the LORD.
24:23:29/Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?
24:23:30/Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another.
24:23:31/Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, 'The LORD declares.'
24:23:32/Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams, declares the LORD, and tell them, leading my people astray with their lies and their recklessness. I did not send them or command them, and they do not benefit this people at all, declares the LORD.
24:23:33/And when this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, 'What is the burden of the LORD?' you shall say to them, 'What burden? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.'
24:23:34/And as for the prophet, priest, or anyone who says, 'The burden of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household.
24:23:35/This is what you shall say to one another, and to your brothers: 'What has the LORD answered?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?'
24:23:36/But 'the burden of the LORD' you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
24:23:37/This is what you shall say to the prophet: 'What has the LORD answered you?' and 'What has the LORD spoken?'
24:23:38/But since you say, 'The burden of the LORD,' therefore thus says the LORD: Because you say this phrase, 'The burden of the LORD,' and I have sent to you, saying, 'Do not say, "The burden of the LORD,"'
24:23:39/Therefore, behold, I will surely forget you and cast you away from my presence, along with the city that I gave to you and your ancestors.
24:23:40/And I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace and perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.
24:24:1/The LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, along with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24:24:2/One basket had very good figs, like those that are first ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which were so bad they couldn't be eaten.
24:24:3/Then the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "Figs; the good ones are very good, and the bad ones are very bad, so bad they can't be eaten."
24:24:4/Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24:24:5/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Just like these good figs, I will look favorably on those from Judah who have been exiled to Babylon for their own good.
24:24:6/I will keep my eye on them for their benefit, and I will bring them back to this land. I will rebuild them and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
24:24:7/And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me with all their heart.
24:24:8/And as for the bad figs, which are so bad they can't be eaten, this is what the LORD says: In the same way, I will deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his princes, and the remainder of Jerusalem, those remaining in this land and those living in Egypt.
24:24:9/I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I will drive them.
24:24:10/And I will send the sword, famine, and plague among them until they are completely wiped out from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.
24:25:1/The message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, which was also the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
24:25:2/Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem, saying,
24:25:3/From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, up to this day, which is the twenty-third year, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have consistently spoken to you, getting up early to do so; but you have not listened.
24:25:4/And the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you, again and again, but you have not listened or paid any attention.
24:25:5/They said, 'Turn back now, each of you, from your evil ways and from your wrong actions, and live in the land that the LORD has given to you and your ancestors forever and ever;
24:25:6/And do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke me to anger with what you make with your hands; then I will not harm you.'
24:25:7/Yet you have not listened to me, says the LORD, so as to provoke me to anger with what your hands have made, to your own detriment.
24:25:8/Therefore, this is what the LORD of hosts says; Because you have not listened to my words,
24:25:9/Look, I will send for all the families of the north, says the LORD, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror, a source of constant hissing, and everlasting ruins.
24:25:10/I will remove from them the sounds of joy and happiness, the voices of the bride and the bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamps.
24:25:11/And this entire land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
24:25:12/But when seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, says the LORD, for their wrongdoing, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it desolate forever.
24:25:13/I will bring upon that land all the words I have declared against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
24:25:14/For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them as well; and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.
24:25:15/For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to me; 'Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
24:25:16/They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.'
24:25:17/Then I took the cup from the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom the LORD had sent me:
24:25:18/Including Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its officials, to make them a ruin, an object of horror, hissing, and cursing, as it is today;
24:25:19/Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, and all his people;
24:25:20/And all the mixed peoples, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (including Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnants of Ashdod),
24:25:21/Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites,
24:25:22/All the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands across the sea,
24:25:23/Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair,
24:25:24/All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed peoples living in the desert,
24:25:25/All the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media,
24:25:26/And all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach will drink after them.
24:25:27/Therefore, tell them, 'This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword I will send among you.'
24:25:28/And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, 'This is what the LORD of hosts says: You will certainly drink.
24:25:29/See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my name, and should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of hosts.'
24:25:30/Therefore, prophesy against them all these words, and say to them, 'The LORD will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling; he will roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
24:25:31/A tumult will reach to the ends of the earth, for the LORD has a dispute with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all people; he will put the wicked to the sword,' declares the LORD.
24:25:32/This is what the LORD of hosts says: 'Look, disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a great storm is being stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth.'
24:25:33/And those slain by the LORD on that day will extend from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried; they will be like dung on the ground.
24:25:34/Wail, you shepherds, and cry out; roll in the ashes, you leaders of the flock. For the days of your slaughter and dispersion have arrived, and you will fall like precious vessels.
24:25:35/And the shepherds will have no way to flee, nor the leaders of the flock any means of escape.
24:25:36/A cry of the cry of the shepherds, and a wailing of the leaders of the flock, will be heard, for the LORD is laying waste their pasture.
24:25:37/And the peaceful habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
24:25:38/He has left his lair like a lion, for their land has become desolate because of the sword of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
24:26:1/At the start of Jehoiakim's reign, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came from the LORD:
24:26:2/The LORD says; Stand in the courtyard of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah who come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words I command you to speak to them; do not omit a single word:
24:26:3/Perhaps they will listen and each turn from their evil ways, so I can change my mind about the disaster I plan to bring on them because of their wicked actions.
24:26:4/You must tell them, The LORD says; If you do not listen to me, to follow my law which I have laid out for you,
24:26:5/To listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again, but you have not listened;
24:26:6/Then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city will become a curse to all the nations of the earth.
24:26:7/So the priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
24:26:8/When Jeremiah finished speaking everything the LORD had commanded him to say to all the people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, saying, You must surely die.
24:26:9/Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without an inhabitant? And all the people gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
24:26:10/When the princes of Judah heard about this, they went up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and sat at the entrance of the new gate of the LORD's house.
24:26:11/Then the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people, This man deserves to die because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.
24:26:12/Then Jeremiah said to all the princes and to all the people, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words you have heard.
24:26:13/So now, reform your ways and your actions and obey the LORD your God; then the LORD will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you.
24:26:14/As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right.
24:26:15/But be sure of this: if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants, because the LORD has truly sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.
24:26:16/Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, This man does not deserve to die, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
24:26:17/Then some of the elders of the land stood up and spoke to the entire assembly of the people, saying,
24:26:18/Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, The LORD of hosts says; Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple hill will become overgrown with thickets.
24:26:19/Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and seek the LORD's favor, and did not the LORD relent concerning the disaster he had pronounced against them? We are about to bring a great disaster on ourselves.
24:26:20/There was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land in words similar to all those of Jeremiah.
24:26:21/And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and was afraid, so he fled and went to Egypt.
24:26:22/King Jehoiakim then sent men to Egypt, Elnathan son of Achbor and others with him, to Egypt.
24:26:23/They brought Uriah back from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who killed him with the sword and threw his body into the burial place of the common people.
24:26:24/However, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
24:27:1/At the start of Jehoiakim's reign, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24:27:2/The LORD told me to make bonds and yokes and wear them around my neck,
24:27:3/And to send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, through the messengers coming to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
24:27:4/And instruct them to tell their leaders, "This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Tell your masters;
24:27:5/I created the earth, humans, and animals that walk on it with my immense power and outstretched arm, and I give it to whoever I choose.
24:27:6/Now, I have handed all these lands over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant; I've even given him the wild animals to serve him.
24:27:7/And all nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson, until his own land's time comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.
24:27:8/Any nation or kingdom that refuses to serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, or to put their neck under his yoke, I will punish with war, famine, and disease until I have destroyed them through him.
24:27:9/So, do not listen to your prophets, diviners, dreamers, magicians, or sorcerers who tell you, 'You won't have to serve the king of Babylon.'
24:27:10/They are lying to you, leading you to be removed far from your land; I will drive you out, and you will perish.
24:27:11/But the nations that submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land," says the LORD; "and they will farm it and live there."
24:27:12/I also told Zedekiah king of Judah all these things, saying, "Submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and live.
24:27:13/Why should you and your people die by the sword, famine, and disease, as the LORD has warned against any nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?
24:27:14/So, do not listen to the prophets who tell you, 'You won't have to serve the king of Babylon.' They are deceiving you.
24:27:15/I haven't sent them," says the LORD, "yet they lie in my name, leading to your expulsion and death, you and the prophets who lie to you."
24:27:16/I also told the priests and all the people, "The LORD says, 'Do not listen to your prophets who claim, 'Soon the LORD's house vessels will be brought back from Babylon.' They are lying to you.
24:27:17/Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city be destroyed?
24:27:18/If they are true prophets and have the LORD's word, let them plead with the LORD of hosts not to let the remaining items in the LORD's house, the royal palace of Judah, and Jerusalem be taken to Babylon.
24:27:19/For this is what the LORD of hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the remaining items in this city,
24:27:20/Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he exiled Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
24:27:21/Indeed, the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says about the items remaining in the LORD's house, the royal palace of Judah, and Jerusalem;
24:27:22/They will be taken to Babylon and remain there until the day I attend to them," says the LORD. "Then, I will bring them back and restore them to this place."
24:28:1/That year, at the start of Zedekiah's reign over Judah, in the fourth year and fifth month, Hananiah son of Azur, a prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the LORD's house, in front of the priests and all the people, saying,
24:28:2/"This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24:28:3/Within two years, I will bring back to this place all the items from the LORD's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away and brought to Babylon.
24:28:4/And I will return Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon, says the LORD, because I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
24:28:5/Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people standing in the LORD's house,
24:28:6/"Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied and bring back from Babylon to this place the items from the LORD's house and all the captives.
24:28:7/However, listen now to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
24:28:8/The prophets before us, long ago, prophesied war, disaster, and disease against many countries and great kingdoms.
24:28:9/When a prophet predicts peace and their prophecy comes true, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent that prophet."
24:28:10/Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it.
24:28:11/And Hananiah declared in front of all the people, "This is what the LORD says: 'In the same way, I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within two years.'" And the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.
24:28:12/After Hananiah broke the yoke from off Jeremiah's neck, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:28:13/"Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what the LORD says: You have broken yokes of wood, but you will make in their place yokes of iron.
24:28:14/For this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I have put an iron yoke on the neck of all these nations, so they will serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. I have even given him the animals of the field.'"
24:28:15/Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen, Hananiah; the LORD has not sent you, yet you have made this people trust in a lie.
24:28:16/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you will die because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.'"
24:28:17/So Hananiah the prophet died that same year in the seventh month.
24:29:1/Here are the contents of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders who were taken as captives, as well as to the priests, prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem to Babylon;
24:29:2/This happened after King Jeconiah, the queen, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and metalworkers had left Jerusalem.
24:29:3/It was delivered by Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said,
24:29:4/"This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the captives I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24:29:5/"Build homes and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
24:29:6/"Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease.
24:29:7/"Also, seek the welfare of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper."
24:29:8/"Do not let your prophets and diviners among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have.
24:29:9/"They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them," declares the LORD.
24:29:10/"This is what the LORD says: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place.
24:29:11/"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
24:29:12/"Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
24:29:13/"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
24:29:14/"I will be found by you," declares the LORD, "and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you," declares the LORD, "and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile."
24:29:15/"Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,'
24:29:16/"know that this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David's throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile—
24:29:17/"This is what the LORD of hosts says: 'I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them and will make them like poor figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.
24:29:18/"I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and plague and will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of dread, ridicule, and scorn among all the nations where I drive them,
24:29:19/"because they have not listened to my words,' says the LORD, 'which I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. But you would not listen,' says the LORD.
24:29:20/"Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24:29:21/"This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: 'I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes.
24:29:22/"Because of them, a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon, saying, 'May the LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire,'
24:29:23/"because they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken lies in my name, which I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness," declares the LORD.
24:29:24/"Thus you shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
24:29:25/"This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
24:29:26/'The LORD has appointed you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest to be in charge in the house of the LORD; you should put any madman who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons.
24:29:27/"So why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who poses as a prophet among you?
24:29:28/"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, 'This exile will be long: build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat their produce.'"
24:29:29/And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
24:29:30/Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:29:31/"Send to all the exiles, saying, 'This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has led you to believe a lie,
24:29:32/"this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will not have anyone living among this people, nor will he see the good that I will do for my people,' declares the LORD, 'because he has preached rebellion against the LORD.'"
24:30:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD was,
24:30:2/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Write down all the words I have spoken to you in a book.
24:30:3/For the time is coming, says the LORD, when I will bring back my people Israel and Judah from captivity. I will bring them back to the land I gave their ancestors, and they will take possession of it again.
24:30:4/These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.
24:30:5/This is what the LORD says: We have heard a sound of terror, of fear, and not of peace.
24:30:6/Now ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, and every face turned pale with fear?
24:30:7/Alas! That day is so great there is none like it. It is a time of distress for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.
24:30:8/On that day, declares the LORD of hosts, I will break the yoke off your neck and tear off your bonds. No longer will foreigners enslave you.
24:30:9/Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24:30:10/So do not fear, my servant Jacob, says the LORD, nor be dismayed, Israel. For I will save you from a distance, your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and will be at peace and secure, with no one to make him afraid.
24:30:11/For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you. Though I completely destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you justly and will not let you go unpunished.
24:30:12/This is what the LORD says: Your injury is incurable, your wound is severe.
24:30:13/There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you.
24:30:14/All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many.
24:30:15/Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins, I have done these things to you.
24:30:16/But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who prey on you I will make prey.
24:30:17/But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds, declares the LORD, because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.
24:30:18/This is what the LORD says: I will restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on its ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place.
24:30:19/From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will increase them, and they will not be decreased; I will honor them, and they will not be belittled.
24:30:20/Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them.
24:30:21/Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me, for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me? declares the LORD.
24:30:22/Then you will be my people, and I will be your God.
24:30:23/Behold, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.
24:30:24/The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In the latter days, you will understand this.
24:31:1/At that time, says the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.
24:31:2/This is what the LORD says: The people who survived the sword found favor in the wilderness; Israel, when I went to give him rest.
24:31:3/The LORD appeared to us in the past, saying: Indeed, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to show you kindness.
24:31:4/Once again I will rebuild you, and you will be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel. You will again be adorned with your tambourines and go out in joyful dancing.
24:31:5/You will plant vineyards again on the hills of Samaria; the planters will plant and enjoy the fruit.
24:31:6/For there will be a day when the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim will call out, 'Arise, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.'
24:31:7/For this is what the LORD says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, 'LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.'
24:31:8/Behold, I will bring them from the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return.
24:31:9/They will come with weeping; I will lead them with prayers of supplication. I will guide them to streams of water, on a straight path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.
24:31:10/Listen to the word of the LORD, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.
24:31:11/For the LORD has redeemed Jacob and ransomed him from the hand of one stronger than he.
24:31:12/They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant over the bounty of the LORD—over the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd. Their life will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more.
24:31:13/Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.
24:31:14/I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty, declares the LORD.
24:31:15/This is what the LORD says: A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.
24:31:16/This is what the LORD says: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded, declares the LORD. They will return from the land of the enemy.
24:31:17/So there is hope for your future, declares the LORD. Your children will return to their own territory.
24:31:18/I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning: 'You disciplined me, and I have been disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the LORD my God.
24:31:19/After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.'
24:31:20/Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him, declares the LORD.
24:31:21/Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Take note of the highway, the road that you take. Return, O virgin Israel, return to these your towns.
24:31:22/How long will you wander, unfaithful daughter Israel? The LORD has created a new thing on the earth: A woman will surround a man.
24:31:23/This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: 'The LORD bless you, O righteous dwelling, O sacred mountain.'
24:31:24/People will live together in Judah and all its towns—farmers and those who move about with their flocks.
24:31:25/I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.
24:31:26/At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.
24:31:27/Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals.
24:31:28/And just as I have watched over them to uproot and tear down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, declares the LORD.
24:31:29/In those days people will no longer say, 'The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'
24:31:30/But everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
24:31:31/Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
24:31:32/It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them, declares the LORD.
24:31:33/But this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
24:31:34/No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.
24:31:35/This is what the LORD says, He who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—The LORD Almighty is His name:
24:31:36/Only if these decrees vanish from my sight, declares the LORD, will Israel ever cease being a nation before me.
24:31:37/This is what the LORD says: Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done, declares the LORD.
24:31:38/Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when the city will be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24:31:39/The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn toward Goah.
24:31:40/And the whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the LORD. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.
24:32:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
24:32:2/At that time, the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's palace.
24:32:3/Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, asking, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it;
24:32:4/And Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans but will definitely be handed over to the king of Babylon. They will speak face to face, and Zedekiah will see him eye to eye;
24:32:5/And he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I deal with him, says the LORD. Even if you fight the Chaldeans, you will not succeed."
24:32:6/And Jeremiah said, "The LORD spoke to me, saying,
24:32:7/Look, Hanameel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you and say, 'Buy my field in Anathoth, because you have the right to redeem it by purchase.'
24:32:8/So Hanameel, my uncle's son, came to me in the courtyard of the guard as the LORD had said, and told me, 'Please buy my field in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin, because you have the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.' Then I realized this was the LORD's command.
24:32:9/So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hanameel, my uncle's son, and paid him seventeen shekels of silver.
24:32:10/And I signed the deed, sealed it, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on scales.
24:32:11/Then I took the purchase deed, both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy,
24:32:12/And I handed the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in the presence of Hanameel, my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who had signed the purchase deed, and before all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
24:32:13/And I instructed Baruch in their presence, saying,
24:32:14/"This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the purchase deed, and place them in a clay jar so they will last a long time.
24:32:15/For this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Homes, fields, and vineyards will once again be bought in this land."
24:32:16/After I had given the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,
24:32:17/"Oh Sovereign LORD! You have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you.
24:32:18/You show love to thousands but bring the consequences of the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
24:32:19/You have great plans and perform mighty deeds. Your eyes are open to all the ways of mankind; you reward everyone according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve.
24:32:20/You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued to do so in Israel and among all humanity, and have made a name for yourself, as is the case today.
24:32:21/You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
24:32:22/And you gave them this land, which you swore to their ancestors to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
24:32:23/They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of what you commanded them to do, so you have brought all this disaster upon them.
24:32:24/See the siege ramps; they have come to the city to capture it. And the city has been handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it, because of the sword, famine, and plague. What you have spoken has happened; as you see, it is so.
24:32:25/And yet, O Sovereign LORD, you have told me to buy the field with money and get witnesses, even though the city is being handed over to the Babylonians."
24:32:26/Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:32:27/"I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?
24:32:28/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.
24:32:29/The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where people have provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
24:32:30/From their youth, the people of Israel and Judah have done only what is evil in my sight; they have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
24:32:31/This city has aroused my anger and wrath from the day it was built to this day, so I must remove it from my presence
24:32:32/because of all the evil of the Israelites and the people of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, the people of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24:32:33/They turned their backs to me, not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline.
24:32:34/They placed their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name, defiling it.
24:32:35/They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded it, nor did it enter my mind that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.
24:32:36/Now therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about this city you say will be handed over to the king of Babylon through sword, famine, and plague:
24:32:37/"Behold, I will gather them from all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, fury, and great wrath. I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
24:32:38/They will be my people, and I will be their God.
24:32:39/I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me for their own good and the good of their children after them.
24:32:40/I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so they will never turn away from me.
24:32:41/Yes, I will delight in doing them good, and I will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.
24:32:42/For this is what the LORD says: Just as I have brought all this great disaster on this people, so I will bring on them all the good I have promised them.
24:32:43/Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, 'It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, and it has been handed over to the Babylonians.'
24:32:44/People will buy fields for money, sign deeds, seal them, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the areas around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, in the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the lowland, and in the towns of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.
24:33:1/Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still confined in the prison courtyard, saying,
24:33:2/"This is what the LORD says, the one who created it, the LORD who formed it to establish it; the LORD is his name;
24:33:3/Reach out to me, and I will respond to you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.
24:33:4/For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the houses of this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been demolished by the siege ramps and the sword;
24:33:5/They are coming to fight the Babylonians, but it will only result in filling the city with the corpses of those I have struck down in my anger and wrath, and for all whose evil I have turned my face away from this city.
24:33:6/Look, I will bring it healing and restoration, and I will heal them and reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.
24:33:7/And I will reverse the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them as before.
24:33:8/I will cleanse them from all their sin against me and forgive all their sins of rebellion against me.
24:33:9/And this will bring me joy, praise, and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good I do for them; they will be in awe and tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for them.
24:33:10/"This is what the LORD says; Once more there will be heard in this place, which you say is a wasteland without people or animals, in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, without people, without inhabitants, and without animals,
24:33:11/the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and groom, and the voices of those who say, 'Praise the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever!' as they bring thanksgiving sacrifices to the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before," says the LORD.
24:33:12/"This is what the LORD of hosts says; In this place, desolate without people or animals, and in all its cities, there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
24:33:13/In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the foothills, in the towns of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, the areas around Jerusalem, and the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them," says the LORD.
24:33:14/"Look, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah.
24:33:15/In those days and at that time, I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David's line; he will do what is just and right in the land.
24:33:16/In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: The LORD Our Righteous Savior.'
24:33:17/For this is what the LORD says: 'David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
24:33:18/nor will the priests, the Levites, ever fail to have a man to stand before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present sacrifices.'"
24:33:19/And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:33:20/"This is what the LORD says; If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed times,
24:33:21/then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne.
24:33:22/Just as the stars of the sky cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me."
24:33:23/Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:33:24/"Have you not noticed what these people are saying, 'The LORD has rejected the two kingdoms he chose'? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation.
24:33:25/This is what the LORD says: 'If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed laws of heaven and earth,
24:33:26/then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.'"
24:34:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his entire army, and all the kingdoms under his control, along with all the people, waged war against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities, was this:
24:34:2/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will set it on fire.
24:34:3/You won't escape from him but will definitely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, he will speak to you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.'
24:34:4/However, listen to the LORD's message, O Zedekiah king of Judah; 'This is what the LORD says about you: You will not die by the sword.
24:34:5/But you will die peacefully. Like the ceremonies for your predecessors, the former kings before you, so will they burn incense for you and mourn for you, saying, "Alas, lord!" because I have declared it, says the LORD.'
24:34:6/Then Jeremiah the prophet relayed all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
24:34:7/While the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, Lachish, and Azekah, for these fortified cities were the only ones left in Judah.
24:34:8/This message came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for them;
24:34:9/Ensuring that every man would release his male and female Hebrew slaves, so that no one would enslave a fellow Jew.
24:34:10/When all the officials and people who had entered into the covenant heard that everyone was to release their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage, they complied and let them go.
24:34:11/But later they changed their minds and took back the male and female slaves they had released, forcing them into slavery again.
24:34:12/Therefore, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
24:34:13/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, from a life of slavery, saying,
24:34:14/At the end of seven years, each of you must release your fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you. After serving you for six years, you must let them go free. But your ancestors did not listen to me or pay attention.
24:34:15/Recently you repented and did what is right in my eyes by proclaiming freedom to one another, and you made a covenant before me in the temple that bears my name.
24:34:16/But then you changed your minds and profaned my name by forcing back into slavery the men and women you had set free, according to their desire, to be your slaves again.'
24:34:17/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'You have not obeyed me by proclaiming freedom, each for your fellow countrymen and countrywomen. Behold, I proclaim freedom for you, says the LORD, to the sword, to plague, and to famine. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24:34:18/And I will hand over those who have violated my covenant, who have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me when they cut a calf in two and walked between its parts—
24:34:19/The officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who walked between the parts of the calf—
24:34:20/I will hand them over to their enemies, to those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
24:34:21/And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will hand over to their enemies, to those who seek their lives, and to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.
24:34:22/Behold, I will command, says the LORD, and bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. And I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without any inhabitants.
24:35:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, was this:
24:35:2/Go to the Rechabite family, talk to them, then bring them into one of the rooms of the LORD's house and offer them wine to drink.
24:35:3/So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habaziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and the whole Rechabite family;
24:35:4/And led them into the LORD's house, into the room of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God, next to the room of the officials, above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.
24:35:5/Then I placed pots full of wine and cups in front of the Rechabites and said to them, "Drink some wine."
24:35:6/But they replied, "We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab gave us this command: 'Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine.
24:35:7/Also you must never build houses, sow seed, plant vineyards, or own any; but you must live in tents all your days, so that you may live a long time in the land where you are nomads.'
24:35:8/We have obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, not drinking wine our entire lives—neither we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters.
24:35:9/We have not built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields, or crops.
24:35:10/But we have lived in tents and have fully obeyed and done everything Jonadab our forefather commanded us.
24:35:11/However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, we said, 'Let's go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.' So we have stayed in Jerusalem.
24:35:12/Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:35:13/This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 'Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words?' declares the LORD.
24:35:14/'The commands of Jonadab son of Rechab that he gave his sons not to drink wine have been kept; to this day they do not drink wine because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.
24:35:15/I have sent all my servants the prophets to you, again and again, saying, "Turn now, each of you, from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors." But you have not paid attention or listened to me.
24:35:16/The descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not listened to me.'
24:35:17/Therefore, this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'I am going to bring on Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them, because I spoke to them but they did not listen; I called to them but they did not answer.'"
24:35:18/And Jeremiah said to the Rechabite family, "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your forefather, kept all his instructions, and done everything he commanded,
24:35:19/Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.'"
24:36:1/In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24:36:2/Get a scroll and write on it all the messages I've given you about Israel, Judah, and all the other nations, from the time I first spoke to you during Josiah's reign until now.
24:36:3/Hopefully, the people of Judah will hear about all the disaster I plan to bring on them and will turn from their wicked ways so that I can forgive their sins and wrongdoings.
24:36:4/Then Jeremiah called Baruch, son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote down on a scroll all the LORD's messages as Jeremiah dictated them.
24:36:5/Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying, "I'm confined and can't go to the LORD's temple.
24:36:6/So you must go and read the LORD's messages from the scroll you've written at my dictation. Read them in the temple on a day of fasting, and also read them to all the people of Judah who come from their towns.
24:36:7/Maybe they will plead with the LORD and turn from their evil ways, for the LORD has announced great anger and wrath against this people."
24:36:8/And Baruch, son of Neriah, did everything Jeremiah the prophet instructed him, reading the words of the LORD from the book in the temple.
24:36:9/In the fifth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, a fast was proclaimed before the LORD for all the people in Jerusalem and those coming from the towns of Judah.
24:36:10/Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the LORD's temple, in the room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard, at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's temple, in the hearing of all the people.
24:36:11/When Michaiah, son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the book,
24:36:12/he went down to the king's palace, to the scribe's chamber, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
24:36:13/Then Michaiah told them all the words he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people.
24:36:14/So all the officials sent Jehudi, son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, "Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch, son of Neriah, took the scroll in his hand and went to them.
24:36:15/They said to him, "Please sit down and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.
24:36:16/When they heard all the words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must definitely report all these words to the king."
24:36:17/And they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you write all these words? Did Jeremiah dictate them?"
24:36:18/Baruch replied, "He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book."
24:36:19/Then the officials told Baruch, "You and Jeremiah should go hide. Don't let anyone know where you are."
24:36:20/They went to the king in the courtyard but first stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Then they reported everything they had heard to the king.
24:36:21/The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he brought it from Elishama the scribe's chamber. Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him.
24:36:22/The king was sitting in his winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.
24:36:23/As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king cut the scroll with a scribe's knife and threw it into the firepot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire.
24:36:24/Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words were afraid or tore their clothes in despair.
24:36:25/Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he wouldn't listen to them.
24:36:26/Then the king ordered Jerahmeel, son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.
24:36:27/After the king burned the scroll containing the words Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24:36:28/"Get another scroll and write on it all the original words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.
24:36:29/And tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'The LORD says: You burned this scroll, asking, "Why did you write that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land, wiping out both people and animals from it?"
24:36:30/Therefore, the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: None of his descendants will sit on David's throne, and his body will be thrown out to suffer in the heat by day and the frost by night.
24:36:31/I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their wrongdoing. I will bring upon them, the residents of Jerusalem, and the people of Judah all the disaster I have declared, but they refused to listen.'"
24:36:32/Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch, the scribe, son of Neriah, who wrote on it at Jeremiah's dictation all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
24:37:1/King Zedekiah, son of Josiah, took the throne instead of Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, appointed as king in Judah.
24:37:2/But neither he, his officials, nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD, spoken through the prophet Jeremiah.
24:37:3/Zedekiah sent Jehucal, son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, asking, "Please pray to the LORD our God for us."
24:37:4/Jeremiah was able to move freely among the people because he hadn't been imprisoned.
24:37:5/Then Pharaoh's army advanced from Egypt. When the Chaldeans besieging Jerusalem heard the news, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
24:37:6/Then the word of the LORD came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
24:37:7/"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, 'Pharaoh's army, which has come to help you, will return to Egypt, to their own land.'"
24:37:8/"And the Chaldeans will come back, fight against this city, capture it, and set it on fire."
24:37:9/"This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves by thinking, 'The Chaldeans will surely leave us alone.' They will not."
24:37:10/"Even if you were to defeat the entire Chaldean army fighting against you and only wounded soldiers were left, they would still rise up, every man in his tent, and set this city on fire."
24:37:11/When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
24:37:12/Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin, to separate himself from the people there.
24:37:13/While he was at the Benjamin Gate, a guard captain named Irijah, son of Shelemiah, grandson of Hananiah, arrested Jeremiah, accusing him of defecting to the Chaldeans.
24:37:14/Jeremiah responded, "That's not true; I'm not defecting to the Chaldeans." But Irijah didn't listen to him and took Jeremiah to the officials.
24:37:15/The officials were angry with Jeremiah, beat him, and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had converted into a jail.
24:37:16/After Jeremiah had been in the dungeon and cells for many days,
24:37:17/King Zedekiah sent for him and asked him privately, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah replied, "Yes, you will be handed over to the king of Babylon."
24:37:18/Jeremiah then asked King Zedekiah, "What have I done wrong to you, your officials, or your people that you have put me in prison?
24:37:19/Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, 'The king of Babylon won't attack you or this land'?
24:37:20/So now, please listen, my lord the king: Let my plea be heard by you; do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there."
24:37:21/Then Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be kept in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread daily from the bakers' street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.
24:38:1/Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,
24:38:2/This is what the LORD says, Anyone who stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and disease. But those who surrender to the Chaldeans will live; they will escape with their lives.
24:38:3/This is what the LORD says, This city will definitely be handed over to the Babylonian army, and they will capture it.
24:38:4/So the officials said to the king, "Please, let this man be executed. By saying these things, he is demoralizing the soldiers who are left in the city, as well as all the people. This man is not looking out for the well-being of the people but their harm."
24:38:5/Then King Zedekiah said, "He is in your hands; the king can't do anything to stop you."
24:38:6/So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the prison courtyard. They lowered Jeremiah with ropes. In the cistern, there was no water, only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.
24:38:7/Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs in the king's palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cistern; the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
24:38:8/Ebedmelech went out of the palace and said to the king,
24:38:9/"My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in everything they did to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into the cistern where he will starve to death because there's no more bread in the city."
24:38:10/Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, "Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."
24:38:11/So Ebedmelech took the men with him, went to a room under the treasury in the palace, and took some old rags and worn-out clothes. He let these down to Jeremiah in the cistern with ropes.
24:38:12/And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your armpits to pad the ropes." Jeremiah did so.
24:38:13/So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah stayed in the prison courtyard.
24:38:14/Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. "I have something to ask you," the king said to Jeremiah. "Do not hide anything from me."
24:38:15/Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, won't you surely kill me? And if I give you advice, you won't listen to me anyway."
24:38:16/So King Zedekiah secretly promised Jeremiah, "As the LORD lives, who gave us our lives, I will not kill you or hand you over to those who are seeking your life."
24:38:17/Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: If you surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared, and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.
24:38:18/But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians, and they will burn it down, and you will not escape from them."
24:38:19/And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have defected to the Babylonians, for fear they might hand me over to them and they will mock me."
24:38:20/But Jeremiah said, "They will not hand you over. Please, obey the LORD in what I am telling you, so it will go well for you, and your life will be spared.
24:38:21/But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me:
24:38:22/All the women remaining in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say, 'Your close friends have misled you and have overcome you. Your feet are stuck in the mud, and they have turned away from you.'
24:38:23/All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians, and you will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon. And this city will be burned down."
24:38:24/Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no one know about these conversations, and you will not die.
24:38:25/If the officials hear that I've talked with you and they come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not kill you,'
24:38:26/then you should tell them, 'I was presenting my petition to the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.'"
24:38:27/All the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they stopped questioning him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
24:38:28/So Jeremiah stayed in the prison courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured. He was there when Jerusalem was taken.
24:39:1/In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign over Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his entire army attacked Jerusalem and laid siege to it.
24:39:2/And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city's defenses were breached.
24:39:3/All the high-ranking officials of the king of Babylon entered and took their places at the central gate, including Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, along with all the other Babylonian officials.
24:39:4/When Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saw them and all the soldiers, they fled, escaping the city at night through the king’s garden and the gate between the two walls, heading toward the plain.
24:39:5/However, the Babylonian army chased them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. After capturing him, they took him to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed judgment on him.
24:39:6/Then the king of Babylon executed Zedekiah's sons in Riblah right before his eyes. He also killed all the leaders of Judah.
24:39:7/Moreover, he blinded Zedekiah and bound him with chains to take him to Babylon.
24:39:8/The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people, and they demolished the walls of Jerusalem.
24:39:9/Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took into exile to Babylon the remaining people in the city, those who had defected to him, and the rest of the population.
24:39:10/But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left behind the poorest people, who owned nothing, in the land of Judah, and at the same time gave them vineyards and fields.
24:39:11/Now Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
24:39:12/"Take him, ensure his well-being, and do him no harm; but do as he asks of you."
24:39:13/So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent, along with Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the high officials of the king of Babylon;
24:39:14/They took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and handed him over to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he lived among the people.
24:39:15/While Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
24:39:16/"Go and tell Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, 'This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they will happen before you on that day.'
24:39:17/But I will rescue you on that day, declares the LORD, and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.
24:39:18/For I will surely save you, and you will not fall by the sword, but your life will be spared because you have trusted in me, declares the LORD."
24:40:1/The message that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had released him from Ramah. He had been taken there in chains along with all the others from Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
24:40:2/And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah aside and told him, "The LORD your God has declared this disaster on this place."
24:40:3/Now the LORD has brought it to pass, just as he said, because you sinned against the LORD and did not listen to his voice. This is why this disaster has happened to you.
24:40:4/And now, today, I am freeing you from the chains on your hands. If you want to come with me to Babylon, you're welcome to do so, and I'll take good care of you. But if you don't want to come to Babylon, that's fine too. Look, the whole land is in front of you; go wherever you think is best and most convenient for you."
24:40:5/Before he left, he also said, "Go back to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed as governor over the cities of Judah. Stay with him among the people, or go anywhere else you think is convenient." Then the captain of the guard gave him some food and a gift and let him go.
24:40:6/So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
24:40:7/When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, as governor over the land and had put under his care men, women, children, and the poorest people of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon,
24:40:8/they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. This group included Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah, Seraiah, son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah, son of a Maachathite, along with their men.
24:40:9/And Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, assured them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Stay in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
24:40:10/As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us. But you, gather wine, summer fruits, and oil, store them in your containers, and live in the cities you have taken over."
24:40:11/Also, when all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in Edom, and in all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, over them,
24:40:12/all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been scattered and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They harvested a great amount of wine and summer fruits.
24:40:13/Moreover, Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army officers who were in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
24:40:14/and warned him, "Do you know for sure that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, to kill you?" But Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, did not believe them.
24:40:15/Then Johanan, son of Kareah, spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah in private, saying, "Let me go and kill Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and no one will know. Why should he assassinate you and cause all the Jews who have gathered around you to scatter, and the remnant of Judah to perish?"
24:40:16/But Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, said to Johanan, son of Kareah, "Do not do this. You are spreading lies about Ishmael."
24:41:1/In the seventh month, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, who was of royal descent, along with ten princes, visited Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, in Mizpah. There, they shared a meal together in Mizpah.
24:41:2/Then Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and the ten men with him stood up and attacked Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with a sword, killing him. Gedaliah had been appointed governor over the land by the king of Babylon.
24:41:3/Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him and Gedaliah in Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian soldiers found there, and the warriors.
24:41:4/The day after he killed Gedaliah, nobody knew about it.
24:41:5/Some men from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, eighty in total, came with shaved beards, torn clothes, and self-inflicted wounds, carrying offerings and incense to present at the LORD's house.
24:41:6/Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, left Mizpah to greet them, crying as he went. When he met them, he invited them to see Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.
24:41:7/When they arrived in the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and his men killed them and threw their bodies into a pit.
24:41:8/However, ten men among them pleaded with Ishmael, saying they had hidden stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the fields. So he spared their lives and didn't kill them with their brothers.
24:41:9/The pit where Ishmael threw the bodies of the men he killed because of Gedaliah was originally dug by King Asa as a defense against Baasha, king of Israel. Ishmael filled it with the slain.
24:41:10/Then Ishmael took captive all the remaining people in Mizpah, including the king's daughters and everyone else Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah. Ishmael took them captive and set off to go to the Ammonites.
24:41:11/But when Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the military commanders with him heard about all the evil Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had done,
24:41:12/They gathered their forces and went to confront Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, finding him near the large pool in Gibeon.
24:41:13/When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan, son of Kareah, and the military commanders with him, they were relieved.
24:41:14/So all the people Ishmael had taken from Mizpah turned around, went back, and joined Johanan, son of Kareah.
24:41:15/But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, managed to escape from Johanan with eight men and fled to the Ammonites.
24:41:16/Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the military commanders with him took all the survivors they had rescued from Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah after he had killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. This included warriors, women, children, and eunuchs they had brought back from Gibeon.
24:41:17/They left and settled in Chimham near Bethlehem, planning to go to Egypt,
24:41:18/Because they were afraid of the Babylonians, since Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
24:42:1/Then all the military leaders, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached,
24:42:2/And said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Please, let our plea be heard by you, and pray to the LORD your God for us, for all of us who remain; (we are only a few left from many, as you can see with your own eyes:)"
24:42:3/"So that the LORD your God may show us the way we should go, and what we should do."
24:42:4/Then Jeremiah the prophet told them, "I have heard you; look, I will pray to the LORD your God as you have requested; and whatever the LORD answers, I will tell you; I will not withhold anything from you."
24:42:5/Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to everything the LORD your God sends you to tell us."
24:42:6/Whether it is good or bad, we will listen to the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we are sending you; so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the LORD our God."
24:42:7/And after ten days, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
24:42:8/Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the military leaders who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,
24:42:9/And said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea, says;"
24:42:10/"If you stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, I will plant you and not uproot you: for I regret the harm I have done to you."
24:42:11/"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now afraid of; do not fear him, says the LORD: for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand."
24:42:12/"And I will show you mercy, so that he may have mercy on you and allow you to return to your own land."
24:42:13/"But if you say, 'We will not live in this land,' refusing to listen to the voice of the LORD your God,"
24:42:14/"Saying, 'No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread; and there we will live:'"
24:42:15/"Now therefore hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah; This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to live there;"
24:42:16/"Then the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine you are worried about will follow closely after you there in Egypt; and there you will die."
24:42:17/"So will it happen to all the men who decide to go to Egypt to live there; they will die by the sword, by famine, and by disease: and none of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring upon them."
24:42:18/"For this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; As my anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so will my wrath be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. You will become an object of horror, a curse, and ridicule; and you will never see this place again."
24:42:19/"The LORD has told you, O remnant of Judah; Do not go into Egypt. Know for certain that I have warned you today."
24:42:20/"For you were deceitful in your hearts when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray to the LORD our God for us; and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us, and we will do it.'"
24:42:21/"And now I have told you today; but you have not listened to the voice of the LORD your God or to anything he has sent me to tell you."
24:42:22/"Now therefore know for certain that you will die by the sword, by famine, and by disease in the place where you want to go and live."
24:43:1/After Jeremiah finished delivering all the words of the LORD their God to the people, words that the LORD their God had sent him to share, all of these words,
24:43:2/Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men responded to Jeremiah, saying, "You're lying: the LORD our God didn't send you to tell us not to go to Egypt to live there:
24:43:3/But it's Baruch son of Neriah who's pushing you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, so they might kill us or take us as prisoners to Babylon."
24:43:4/So Johanan son of Kareah, all the military commanders, and all the people didn't listen to the LORD's command to stay in the land of Judah.
24:43:5/Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the military commanders took all the remaining people of Judah, who had come back from the nations where they had been scattered, to live in the land of Judah;
24:43:6/This included men, women, children, the king's daughters, and everyone else Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, along with Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah.
24:43:7/So they entered the land of Egypt because they didn't listen to the LORD's command, and they went as far as Tahpanhes.
24:43:8/Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
24:43:9/"Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick kiln at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in view of the men of Judah;
24:43:10/And tell them, 'This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Look, I will send for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant, and I will place his throne over these stones I have hidden; and he will set up his royal tent over them.
24:43:11/When he arrives, he will strike the land of Egypt, giving those destined for death to death, those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword.
24:43:12/And I will set fire to the temples of the Egyptian gods; he will burn them and take them captive: and he will claim the land of Egypt as his own, as a shepherd wears his cloak; and he will leave there peacefully.
24:43:13/He will also destroy the idols of Bethshemesh in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the Egyptian gods he will burn with fire.
24:44:1/The message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Egypt, in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and the region of Pathros, was:
24:44:2/This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have witnessed all the disaster I brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; today, they are ruins, uninhabited.
24:44:3/Because of their evil deeds that provoked me to anger—burning incense and worshiping gods unknown to them, their ancestors, or you.
24:44:4/Yet, I consistently sent you all my prophets, who tirelessly said, 'Do not commit this detestable act I despise.'
24:44:5/But they did not listen or pay attention, refusing to turn from their wickedness and stop burning incense to other gods.
24:44:6/Therefore, my fury and anger were unleashed, scorching the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem; they are now desolate and empty.
24:44:7/So now, the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, asks: Why do you commit such a great evil against yourselves, ensuring the destruction of men, women, children, and infants from Judah, leaving none to survive?
24:44:8/By provoking me with the work of your hands, burning incense to other gods in Egypt where you've chosen to live, you're cutting yourselves off, becoming a curse and an object of ridicule among all nations.
24:44:9/Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors, the kings of Judah, their wives, your own sins, and those of your wives, committed in Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?
24:44:10/To this day, they remain unrepentant, not fearing me or following my laws and decrees that I set before you and your ancestors.
24:44:11/Therefore, this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to eliminate all of Judah.
24:44:12/I will take the remnant of Judah who decided to go to Egypt to live, and they will all perish, falling by the sword and famine until they are completely gone.
24:44:13/I will punish those living in Egypt as I punished Jerusalem, with the sword, famine, and disease.
24:44:14/None of the survivors of Judah who went to Egypt will escape or survive to return to Judah, where they long to return and live; only a few will manage to return.
24:44:15/Then all the men who knew their wives had burned incense to other gods, along with all the women standing by—a large assembly—and all the people living in Egypt, in Pathros, responded to Jeremiah, saying,
24:44:16/Regarding the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you.
24:44:17/Instead, we will do everything we have vowed to do: burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, were prosperous, and saw no misfortune.
24:44:18/But ever since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been perishing by sword and famine.
24:44:19/And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands' knowledge that we made cakes for her worship and poured out drink offerings to her?
24:44:20/Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, and to all the people who had given him that answer,
24:44:21/Did not the LORD remember and consider the incense you burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, you, your ancestors, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land?
24:44:22/The LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did; so your land became a ruin, a desolation, and a curse, uninhabited as it is today.
24:44:23/Because you burned incense and sinned against the LORD, not obeying the LORD's voice or living by his law, statutes, or testimonies, this disaster has happened to you, as it is today.
24:44:24/Moreover, Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, "Listen to the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in Egypt:
24:44:25/This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have both spoken and acted on your vows, saying, 'We will surely keep our vows to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.' You will indeed keep your vows and carry them out.
24:44:26/Therefore, listen to the word of the LORD, all you of Judah living in Egypt: I swear by my great name, says the LORD, that my name will no longer be invoked by anyone from Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, 'As the Lord GOD lives.'
24:44:27/I am watching over them for harm, not for good; all the men of Judah in Egypt will perish by the sword and famine until they are completely gone.
24:44:28/Yet a small number who escape the sword will return from Egypt to Judah, and all the remnant of Judah who went to Egypt to live there will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.
24:44:29/And this will be a sign to you, declares the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, so you will know that my words will surely stand against you for harm:
24:44:30/This is what the LORD says: I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, to his enemies and to those seeking his life, just as I handed over Zedekiah king of Judah to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who was seeking his life.
24:45:1/The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the instruction of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
24:45:2/This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, O Baruch:
24:45:3/You said, "Woe is me now! For the LORD has added grief to my sorrow; I am worn out from my sighing, and I find no rest."
24:45:4/Tell him this, 'The LORD says: Look, what I have built I will tear down, and what I have planted I will uproot, this entire land included.
24:45:5/Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don't pursue them: for, look, I am going to bring disaster on all people, says the LORD: but I will let you keep your life as a prize wherever you go.
24:46:1/The message from the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations;
24:46:2/Regarding Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah.
24:46:3/Prepare the shield and buckler, and advance for battle.
24:46:4/Ready the horses; mount up, horsemen, and take your positions with helmets on; polish the spears, and put on the armor.
24:46:5/Why have I seen them terrified and turning back? Their warriors are defeated, fleeing swiftly without looking back, because terror is all around, says the LORD.
24:46:6/Do not let the swift escape nor the strong man survive; they will stumble and fall near the north by the Euphrates River.
24:46:7/Who is this rising like the Nile, with waters surging like rivers?
24:46:8/Egypt rises like the Nile, its waters surging like rivers, saying, 'I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.'
24:46:9/Charge, horses; drive furiously, chariots; let the warriors come forth; the Ethiopians and Libyans who carry shields; and the Lydians who draw the bow.
24:46:10/For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, to avenge Himself on His foes. The sword will devour and be satisfied, drenched with their blood, for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the Euphrates River.
24:46:11/Go up to Gilead and get balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain you use many medicines; there is no healing for you.
24:46:12/The nations have heard of your disgrace, and your cry fills the earth. One warrior stumbles over another, and both fall down together.
24:46:13/The message that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about how Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon would come and strike the land of Egypt.
24:46:14/Announce in Egypt, proclaim in Migdol, proclaim in Memphis and Tahpanhes: 'Take your positions and prepare, for the sword devours all around you.'
24:46:15/Why have your warriors been swept away? They did not stand because the LORD drove them away.
24:46:16/He made many fall; indeed, one fell upon another. They said, 'Get up, let's go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword of the oppressor.'
24:46:17/There they exclaimed, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise; he has missed his opportunity.'
24:46:18/As surely as I live, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, 'Just as Tabor is among the mountains and Carmel by the sea, so will he come.'
24:46:19/O daughter dwelling in Egypt, prepare yourself to go into exile; for Memphis will become a desolation, uninhabited.
24:46:20/Egypt is like a beautiful heifer, but a biting fly is coming from the north—it is coming!
24:46:21/Also her mercenaries in her midst are like fattened calves; for they too will turn and flee together, they will not stand their ground, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their punishment.
24:46:22/Its sound moves like a snake; for they will march with an army and come against her with axes, like those who chop wood.
24:46:23/They will chop down her forest, declares the LORD, though it cannot be searched, because they are more numerous than locusts, and are innumerable.
24:46:24/The daughter of Egypt will be put to shame; she will be handed over to the people of the north.
24:46:25/The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; 'Look, I am about to punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt, its gods and kings, Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
24:46:26/And I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. But afterward, it will be inhabited as in the past, declares the LORD.
24:46:27/But do not fear, O my servant Jacob, and do not be dismayed, O Israel. For see, I will save you from a distant place, and your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.
24:46:28/Do not fear, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, for I am with you. I will make a complete end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a complete end of you. I will discipline you justly, but will not leave you unpunished.
24:47:1/The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza.
24:47:2/This is what the LORD says; Look, waters are rising from the north, becoming an overflowing flood, and will inundate the land and everything in it; the city, and those living in it will be overwhelmed: then people will scream, and all the residents of the land will wail.
24:47:3/Amid the sound of the stomping hooves of his mighty horses, the rush of his chariots, and the roar of his wheels, parents will not turn back to their children because their hands are too weak;
24:47:4/Because of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, and to eliminate every ally of Tyre and Sidon: for the LORD will devastate the Philistines, the survivors from the land of Caphtor.
24:47:5/Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is destroyed along with the last of their valley: how long will you inflict wounds on yourself?
24:47:6/O sword of the LORD, how long until you are silent? Return to your sheath, rest, and be still.
24:47:7/How can it be still, when the LORD has commanded it against Ashkelon and the seashore? There it has been directed.
24:48:1/This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Moab: Disaster is coming for Nebo—it's already ruined. Kiriathaim is captured and shamed; Misgab is shattered and terrified.
24:48:2/Moab will no longer be praised. In Heshbon, they plot its downfall, saying, 'Let's erase it as a nation.' You too, Madmen, will be silenced; the sword is on your trail.
24:48:3/Screams of panic come from Horonaim, cries of great destruction and ruin.
24:48:4/Moab is shattered; the cries of its little ones echo far and wide.
24:48:5/As people climb the slope to Luhith, they weep continuously; on the road down to Horonaim, cries of distress over the destruction are heard.
24:48:6/Run for your lives, save yourselves, and be like a desert shrub.
24:48:7/Because you trusted in your achievements and treasures, you too will be captured, and Chemosh will go into exile, along with his priests and officials.
24:48:8/The destroyer will come upon every town, and no town will escape. The valley will be ruined, and the plateau destroyed, as the LORD has said.
24:48:9/Give Moab wings so it can fly away, for its towns will be left empty, with no one to live in them.
24:48:10/Cursed is the one who does the LORD's work deceitfully, and cursed is the one who holds back their sword from bloodshed.
24:48:11/Moab has been at ease from its youth, like wine left to settle undisturbed, not poured from jar to jar. So it remained the same, its flavor unchanged.
24:48:12/But the time is coming, says the LORD, when I will send those who will tip it over, empty its jars, and smash its jugs.
24:48:13/Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
24:48:14/How can you claim, 'We are warriors, battle-hardened heroes'?
24:48:15/Moab is ruined, its towns ascended by invaders, its finest young men slaughtered, declares the King, the LORD Almighty.
24:48:16/The end of Moab is near; its disaster hurries on.
24:48:17/Mourn for it, all who live around it, all who know its fame. Ask, 'How has the mighty scepter been broken, the glorious staff!'
24:48:18/Come down from your glory, Dibon, and sit in thirst, for the destroyer of Moab will attack you, destroying your strongholds.
24:48:19/You who live in Aroer, stand by the road and watch. Ask those fleeing and those escaping, 'What has happened?'
24:48:20/Moab is humiliated, for it is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
24:48:21/Judgment has come to the plateau—to Holon, Jahazah, Mephaath,
24:48:22/Dibon, Nebo, Bethdiblathaim,
24:48:23/Kiriathaim, Bethgamul, Bethmeon,
24:48:24/Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near.
24:48:25/Moab's power is cut off, and its arm is broken, says the LORD.
24:48:26/Make Moab drunk, for it has boasted against the LORD. Moab will wallow in its vomit, and it too will be ridiculed.
24:48:27/Wasn't Israel a joke to you? Was he caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you talk about him?
24:48:28/Abandon the towns and dwell among the rocks, you residents of Moab. Be like a dove that nests at the entrance of a cave.
24:48:29/We have heard of Moab's pride—how very proud he is—of his arrogance, his pride, and his haughtiness of heart.
24:48:30/I know his fury, says the LORD, but it is futile; his idle boasts have accomplished nothing.
24:48:31/So I wail for Moab, I cry out for all Moab; I mourn for the men of Kirheres.
24:48:32/I weep for you as Jazer weeps, O vine of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea; they reached to the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits and grape harvest.
24:48:33/Joy and gladness are taken away from the fertile fields and from the land of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. The shouting is not the shout of joy.
24:48:34/From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh to Jahaz, they raise their voices, from Zoar to Horonaim to the third year heifer. Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.
24:48:35/I will stop in Moab, says the LORD, the one who offers sacrifices on the high places and burns incense to his gods.
24:48:36/Therefore, my heart laments for Moab like a flute; it laments like a flute for the men of Kirheres. The wealth they acquired has perished.
24:48:37/Every head is shaved, every beard cut off; on all hands are cuts, and around the waist is sackcloth.
24:48:38/On all the rooftops of Moab and in its streets, there is mourning everywhere, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants, says the LORD.
24:48:39/They wail, 'How it is broken! How Moab turns its back in shame!' So Moab has become an object of ridicule and horror to all those around it.
24:48:40/This is what the LORD says: Look! An eagle swoops down, spreading its wings over Moab.
24:48:41/Kerioth is captured, the strongholds are taken, and the hearts of Moab's warriors on that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24:48:42/Moab will be destroyed and no longer be a nation, because it boasted against the LORD.
24:48:43/Fear, the pit, and the snare await you, resident of Moab, says the LORD.
24:48:44/Anyone who flees from the fear will fall into the pit, and anyone who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare. For I will bring upon Moab the year of their punishment, says the LORD.
24:48:45/Those who fled stand powerless under the shadow of Heshbon, because fire has erupted from Heshbon and flames from the midst of Sihon. It devours the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.
24:48:46/Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile, and your daughters into captivity.
24:48:47/Yet, I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says the LORD. Here ends the judgment on Moab.
24:49:1/Regarding the Ammonites, this is what the LORD says: Doesn't Israel have any sons? Doesn't he have an heir? Why then does their king take over Gad, and his people live in its towns?
24:49:2/So, look, the time is coming, declares the LORD, when I will sound the alarm of war in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it will become a desolate mound, and its villages will be set on fire: then Israel will inherit those who inherited him, says the LORD.
24:49:3/Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is ruined: cry out, you daughters of Rabbah, dress in mourning clothes; weep, and pace back and forth by the fences; because their king will go into exile, along with his priests and officials.
24:49:4/Why do you boast about your valleys, your fertile valley, O unfaithful daughter? You trust in your riches, saying, 'Who will come against me?'
24:49:5/Look, I am bringing terror on you, declares the Lord, the LORD of hosts, from all those around you; you will be driven out, each one straight ahead, with no one to gather the fugitives.
24:49:6/And later, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites, declares the LORD.
24:49:7/Regarding Edom, this is what the LORD of hosts says; Has wisdom vanished from Teman? Has counsel disappeared from the wise? Has their wisdom evaporated?
24:49:8/Run away, turn back, hide deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time I punish him.
24:49:9/If grape pickers came to you, wouldn't they leave a few grapes? If thieves came at night, they would destroy only until they had enough.
24:49:10/But I have stripped Esau bare, I have uncovered his hiding places, and he will not be able to conceal himself: his offspring is destroyed, along with his brothers and neighbors, and he is no more.
24:49:11/Leave your orphans; I will keep them alive; and let your widows trust in me.
24:49:12/For this is what the LORD says: Look, those who were not destined to drink the cup will certainly drink it; and are you the one who will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but you will surely drink it.
24:49:13/For I have sworn by myself, declares the LORD, that Bozrah will become a ruin, a disgrace, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities will be perpetual ruins.
24:49:14/I have heard a message from the LORD, and an envoy has been sent to the nations, saying, 'Gather together, come against her, and rise up for battle.'
24:49:15/For, look, I will make you small among the nations, and despised among people.
24:49:16/Your own terror has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, you who live in the clefts of the rocks, who hold the height of the hill: though you make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says the LORD.
24:49:17/Also, Edom will become a wasteland: everyone who passes by it will be shocked and scoff at all its wounds.
24:49:18/Just as in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, says the LORD, no one will live there, no person will dwell in it.
24:49:19/Look, he will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the lush pastureland: but in an instant I will make him run away from it. And who is the chosen one I will appoint for it? For who is like me? Who will summon me to court? And who is that shepherd who can stand before me?
24:49:20/Therefore, listen to the LORD's plan that he has devised against Edom, and his intentions that he has planned against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the little ones of the flock will drag them away; surely their pasture will be desolate because of them.
24:49:21/The earth trembles at the sound of their fall; at their cry, the noise is heard at the Red Sea.
24:49:22/Look, he will soar like an eagle and spread his wings over Bozrah: and on that day, the hearts of Edom's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24:49:23/Regarding Damascus. Hamath and Arpad are dismayed, for they have heard bad news; they are disheartened, troubled like the restless sea.
24:49:24/Damascus has become weak, she turns to flee, and panic has gripped her; distress and pains have seized her, like a woman in labor.
24:49:25/How the city of renown is not deserted, the city of my joy!
24:49:26/Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets, and all her soldiers will be silenced in that day, says the LORD of hosts.
24:49:27/And I will ignite a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.
24:49:28/Regarding Kedar, and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon will strike, this is what the LORD says: Rise up, advance against Kedar, and destroy the people of the East.
24:49:29/Their tents and their flocks will be taken; their curtains, all their goods, and their camels will be carried off. They will cry out to them, 'Terror on every side!'
24:49:30/Run, flee far away, hide deep, O inhabitants of Hazor, says the LORD; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has made plans against you and has conceived a strategy against you.
24:49:31/Rise up, advance against a nation at ease, that lives securely, says the LORD, a nation that has neither gates nor bars, living alone.
24:49:32/Their camels will become plunder, and their vast herds will be spoils. I will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places and bring disaster from every side, says the LORD.
24:49:33/And Hazor will become a dwelling for jackals, a desolation forever; no one will live there, nor will any person dwell in it.
24:49:34/The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
24:49:35/This is what the LORD of hosts says: Look, I will break the bow of Elam, the mainstay of their might.
24:49:36/And upon Elam, I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; there will be no nation where Elam's exiles will not go.
24:49:37/For I will terrify Elam before their enemies and before those who seek their life; I will bring disaster upon them, my fierce anger, says the LORD; and I will send the sword after them until I have finished them off.
24:49:38/And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there the king and the officials, says the LORD.
24:49:39/But it will happen in the latter days, that I will restore the fortunes of Elam, says the LORD.
24:50:1/The message that the LORD delivered regarding Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans through the prophet Jeremiah.
24:50:2/Announce to the nations, proclaim it widely, raise a flag to signal; do not hide it: say, Babylon has been captured, Bel is humiliated, Merodach is shattered; her idols are disgraced, her statues are smashed.
24:50:3/A nation from the north will attack her, turning her land into a wasteland where no one lives; people and animals will flee.
24:50:4/In that time, says the LORD, the people of Israel and Judah will come together, mourning as they seek the LORD their God.
24:50:5/They will ask for directions to Zion, looking forward to joining the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
24:50:6/My people have been like lost sheep; their leaders have led them astray, causing them to wander from mountain to hill, forgetting their resting place.
24:50:7/Everyone who found them has preyed on them, and their enemies argued, "We are not guilty, because they sinned against the LORD, their true place of safety, the LORD, the hope of their ancestors."
24:50:8/Leave Babylon, flee from the land of the Chaldeans, and lead the way like rams in front of a flock.
24:50:9/I am about to stir up a great coalition of nations from the north to attack Babylon, and they will take her. Their arrows will not miss, like those of a skilled warrior.
24:50:10/Chaldea will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill, says the LORD.
24:50:11/Because you were happy and rejoiced at the destruction of my heritage, because you frolicked like a young cow in the grass and neighed like stallions,
24:50:12/your mother will be deeply ashamed; she who gave you birth will be disgraced. Look, the least of the nations will become a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
24:50:13/Because of the LORD's anger, it will be uninhabited, completely desolate. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be shocked and scoff at all her wounds.
24:50:14/Take up positions around Babylon, all you archers, shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.
24:50:15/Raise a war cry against her on every side! She surrenders; her towers fall, her walls are torn down. It is the LORD's vengeance, so take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others.
24:50:16/Stop the sower from Babylon, and the one who wields the sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor's sword, everyone will turn to their own people, flee to their own land.
24:50:17/Israel is like scattered sheep, chased away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured them, and now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has crushed their bones.
24:50:18/Therefore, the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will punish the king of Babylon and his land just as I punished the king of Assyria.
24:50:19/And I will bring Israel back to his pasture, where he will graze on Carmel and Bashan, and his appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
24:50:20/In those days, at that time, says the LORD, the wrongdoing of Israel will be searched for, but there will be none; and the sins of Judah, but they will not be found, for I will forgive those I preserve.
24:50:21/Attack the land of Merathaim and those living in Pekod. Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them, as I have commanded you, says the LORD.
24:50:22/The sound of battle is in the land, and great destruction.
24:50:23/How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
24:50:24/I set a trap for you, O Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the LORD.
24:50:25/The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD of hosts has work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
24:50:26/Come against her from the farthest borders, open her granaries, pile her up like heaps of ruins, and destroy her completely; let nothing of her be left.
24:50:27/Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time for their punishment.
24:50:28/The sound of those fleeing and escaping from the land of Babylon declares in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance for his temple.
24:50:29/Summon archers against Babylon, all who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done, for she has been arrogant against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
24:50:30/Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets, and all her soldiers will be silenced in that day, says the LORD.
24:50:31/Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one, says the Lord GOD of hosts, for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
24:50:32/The arrogant one will stumble and fall, and no one will raise him up. I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will consume everything around him.
24:50:33/This is what the LORD of hosts says: The people of Israel and Judah have been wronged, and all who took them captive hold them tight; they refuse to let them go.
24:50:34/But their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.
24:50:35/A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her officials, and upon her wise men.
24:50:36/A sword is upon the liars; they will become fools. A sword is upon her warriors; they will be dismayed.
24:50:37/A sword is upon their horses and chariots and all the foreign troops in her midst; they will become like women. A sword is upon her treasures; they will be plundered.
24:50:38/A drought is upon her waters, and they will dry up. It is a land of idols, and they are insane over their terrifying images.
24:50:39/Therefore, wild animals of the desert will live with the jackals, and ostriches will inhabit it. It will never be inhabited again, nor will it be settled from generation to generation.
24:50:40/As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, says the LORD, so no one will live there, nor will any person dwell in it.
24:50:41/Behold, a people is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24:50:42/They wield bows and spears; they are cruel and show no mercy. Their sound is like the roaring sea as they ride on horses, arrayed as one man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon.
24:50:43/The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, and his hands hang limp; distress has seized him, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24:50:44/He will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to a secure pasture; but in an instant, I will make them run away from her. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me? Who will summon me? And what shepherd can stand against me?
24:50:45/Therefore, listen to the LORD's plan that he has devised against Babylon, and his purposes that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the smallest of the flock will drag them out; surely their pasture will be appalled at them.
24:50:46/At the sound of Babylon's capture, the earth trembles, and a cry is heard among the nations.
24:51:1/The LORD says, "Look, I will bring a destructive wind against Babylon and against those who oppose me from within her.
24:51:2/And I will send to Babylon winnowers who will scatter her and empty her land. In the day of disaster, they will surround her on all sides.
24:51:3/Let the archer draw his bow against those who prepare for battle, and do not spare her young men; completely destroy her entire army.
24:51:4/So the slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and those pierced by swords will lie in her streets.
24:51:5/For Israel and Judah have not been abandoned by their God, the LORD Almighty, even though their land was filled with guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
24:51:6/Escape from the midst of Babylon, and save your lives. Do not be destroyed because of her sins. This is the time for the LORD's vengeance; he will repay her what she deserves.
24:51:7/Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD's hand, making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore, they have gone mad.
24:51:8/Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail for her; get balm for her pain, perhaps she can be healed.
24:51:9/We tried to heal Babylon, but she cannot be healed. Abandon her and let us each return to our own country. For her judgment reaches to the skies, it rises as high as the heavens.
24:51:10/The LORD has vindicated us; come, let us tell in Zion what the LORD our God has done.
24:51:11/Sharpen the arrows, take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because his purpose against Babylon is to destroy it, for it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for his temple.
24:51:12/Raise a banner against the walls of Babylon! Reinforce the guard, station the watchmen, prepare the ambushes! For the LORD has both planned and done what he spoke against the people of Babylon.
24:51:13/You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your greed.
24:51:14/The LORD Almighty has sworn by himself: "I will surely fill you with troops, as with swarms of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you."
24:51:15/He made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24:51:16/When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24:51:17/Every man is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them.
24:51:18/They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.
24:51:19/He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including the tribe of his inheritance—the LORD Almighty is his name.
24:51:20/"You are my war club, my weapon for battle— with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms,
24:51:21/with you I shatter horse and rider, with you I shatter chariot and driver,
24:51:22/with you I shatter man and woman, with you I shatter old and young, with you I shatter young man and maiden,
24:51:23/with you I shatter shepherd and flock, with you I shatter farmer and oxen, with you I shatter governors and officials.
24:51:24/And I will repay Babylon and all the residents of Chaldea for all the evil they have done in Zion before your very eyes," says the LORD.
24:51:25/"I am against you, you destructive mountain, you who destroy the whole earth," declares the LORD. "I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you off the cliffs, and make you a burned-out mountain.
24:51:26/No rock from you will be taken for a cornerstone, nor any stone for a foundation, for you will be desolate forever," declares the LORD.
24:51:27/Raise a banner in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations for battle against her, summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz; appoint a commander against her, bring up horses like a swarm of locusts.
24:51:28/Prepare the nations for battle against her— the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the countries they rule.
24:51:29/The land trembles and writhes in pain, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitants.
24:51:30/The warriors of Babylon have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken.
24:51:31/One courier rushes to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is captured from end to end,
24:51:32/the river crossings seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers terrified."
24:51:33/For this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come."
24:51:34/"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me like a monster, he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has rinsed me out.
24:51:35/The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon," the inhabitants of Zion will say. "And my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," Jerusalem will say.
24:51:36/Therefore this is what the LORD says: "See, I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.
24:51:37/Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives.
24:51:38/They will roar together like lions, they will growl like lions' cubs.
24:51:39/While they are aroused, I will set out their feasts and make them drunk, so that they shout with laughter, then sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up," declares the LORD.
24:51:40/"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams together with goats.
24:51:41/How Sheshach has been captured, the praise of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!
24:51:42/The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered with its tumultuous waves.
24:51:43/Her cities are a desolation, a dry land and a wilderness, a land where no one lives, through which no son of man passes.
24:51:44/And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will make him spit out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. Even the wall of Babylon will fall.
24:51:45/My people, go out from her, and save your lives from the fierce anger of the LORD.
24:51:46/But do not lose heart or be afraid at the report heard in the land; one report comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.
24:51:47/For the time is surely coming when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced, and her slain will all lie fallen within her.
24:51:48/Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers will come to her from the north," says the LORD.
24:51:49/Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel, just as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth.
24:51:50/You who have escaped the sword, go, do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and let Jerusalem come to your mind.
24:51:51/"We are ashamed because we have heard insults; disgrace has covered our faces, for foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's house."
24:51:52/"Therefore, behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will execute judgment on her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan.
24:51:53/Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her," says the LORD.
24:51:54/A cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
24:51:55/For the LORD is laying Babylon waste and silencing her loud voice. Their waves roar like great waters, the noise of their voices resounds,
24:51:56/for the destroyer has come against her, against Babylon. Her warriors are captured, their bows are broken; for the LORD is a God of retribution, he will surely repay.
24:51:57/I will make her princes and her wise men, her governors, her deputies, and her warriors drunk, and they will sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up," declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
24:51:58/This is what the LORD of hosts says: "The wide walls of Babylon will be completely razed, and her high gates will be set on fire; the peoples will labor for nothing, and the nations' efforts will go up in flames and they will be weary."
24:51:59/The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.
24:51:60/So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
24:51:61/And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud;
24:51:62/then say, 'LORD, you have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but it shall be desolate forever.'
24:51:63/And when you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,
24:51:64/and say, 'Thus shall Babylon sink, never to rise again because of the disaster I will bring upon her; and they will be exhausted.'" These are the words of Jeremiah.
24:52:1/Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
24:52:2/He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as Jehoiakim had done.
24:52:3/Because of the LORD's anger, disaster struck Jerusalem and Judah until he finally banished them from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24:52:4/In the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, arrived with his entire army, besieged Jerusalem, and built siege works all around it.
24:52:5/The city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
24:52:6/By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city had become so severe that the people had no food.
24:52:7/Then the city wall was breached, and all the soldiers fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, while the Babylonians surrounded the city. They fled toward the Arabah.
24:52:8/But the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and caught up with him in the plains of Jericho. His entire army was scattered from him.
24:52:9/They captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they passed sentence on him.
24:52:10/The king of Babylon killed Zedekiah's sons right before his eyes. He also killed all the officials of Judah at Riblah.
24:52:11/Then he blinded Zedekiah, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon, where he was imprisoned until the day of his death.
24:52:12/On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard and servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
24:52:13/He burned the temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He set fire to every significant building.
24:52:14/The entire Babylonian army under the captain of the guard tore down all the walls around Jerusalem.
24:52:15/Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported some of the poorest people, those who remained in the city, those who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
24:52:16/But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
24:52:17/The Babylonians broke the bronze pillars of the LORD's temple, the stands, and the bronze Sea in the temple, and carried the bronze to Babylon.
24:52:18/They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in temple service.
24:52:19/The captain of the guard took away the basins, fire pans, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes, and bowls, whether gold or silver.
24:52:20/The two pillars, one Sea, and the twelve bronze bulls under the Sea, which Solomon had made for the LORD's temple, were too heavy to weigh.
24:52:21/Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference; it was four fingers thick and hollow.
24:52:22/A bronze capital was on top of each pillar. The height of one capital was five cubits, with a network and pomegranates around the capital, all of bronze. The second pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar.
24:52:23/There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates around the network was one hundred.
24:52:24/The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
24:52:25/He also took from the city an official in charge of the soldiers, seven royal advisers who were found in the city, the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land who were found in the city.
24:52:26/Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24:52:27/And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile from its land.
24:52:28/These are the people Nebuchadnezzar took into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
24:52:29/in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
24:52:30/in his twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took 745 Jewish people into exile. The total number of people exiled was 4,600.
24:52:31/On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.
24:52:32/He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
24:52:33/He changed Jehoiachin's prison clothes, and Jehoiachin dined regularly at the king's table for the rest of his life.
24:52:34/And his daily needs were provided by the king of Babylon, a regular allowance for each day, until the day of his death, for the rest of his life.
25:1:1/How lonely sits the city that was once bustling with people! How has she become like a widow, once great among nations, a princess among provinces, now forced to pay tribute!
25:1:2/She weeps bitterly in the night, tears on her cheeks. Among all her lovers, there is no one to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
25:1:3/Judah has been taken into exile due to affliction and harsh labor. She lives among the nations and finds no rest; all her pursuers have caught up with her in tight places.
25:1:4/The roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the appointed festivals. All her gates are deserted; her priests sigh, her young women grieve, and she is bitter.
25:1:5/Her foes have become the masters, her enemies are at ease. The LORD has made her suffer for her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, led away by the enemy.
25:1:6/All the splendor has departed from Daughter Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; they are weakened and flee before the pursuer.
25:1:7/In her days of misery and wandering, Jerusalem remembers all the precious things she had in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her downfall.
25:1:8/Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away.
25:1:9/Her uncleanness is in her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her downfall was astonishing; she had no comforter. "O LORD, see my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."
25:1:10/The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary—those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
25:1:11/All her people groan as they search for bread; they trade their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, LORD, and consider, for I am despised."
25:1:12/Does it mean nothing to you, all who pass by? Look around and see. Is there any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in his fierce anger?
25:1:13/From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
25:1:14/My sins have been bound into a yoke; by his hands they were woven together. They have been placed on my neck, and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has given me into the hands of those I cannot withstand.
25:1:15/The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah as in a winepress.
25:1:16/For these things I weep; my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.
25:1:17/Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
25:1:18/The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look on my suffering. My young men and women have gone into exile.
25:1:19/I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
25:1:20/"See, LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.
25:1:21/People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they are pleased that you have done it. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.
25:1:22/Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint.
25:2:1/How has the LORD shrouded the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and hurled down from heaven to earth the splendor of Israel, forgetting his sanctuary in the day of his wrath!
25:2:2/The LORD has devoured all the dwellings of Jacob without mercy; in his fury, he has demolished the fortresses of the daughter of Judah, bringing them to the ground and defiling the kingdom and its leaders.
25:2:3/In his intense anger, he has cut off every power of Israel; he has withdrawn his support in the face of the enemy, and his anger burned against Jacob like a consuming fire, engulfing everything around.
25:2:4/He has drawn his bow like an enemy; he stood ready to attack, killing all who were a delight to the eye in the sanctuary of the daughter of Zion; he unleashed his rage like fire.
25:2:5/The LORD has become an enemy: he has devoured Israel, destroying all her palaces; he has demolished her fortresses and increased mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.
25:2:6/He has forcefully stripped away his sanctuary as if it were a garden; he has ruined his meeting places: the LORD has made the festivals and Sabbaths be forgotten in Zion, and in his fierce anger, he has scorned both king and priest.
25:2:7/The LORD has rejected his altar, detested his sanctuary, and surrendered the walls of her palaces to the enemy; they have raised a clamor in the house of the LORD, as on the day of a festival.
25:2:8/The LORD has resolved to demolish the wall of the daughter of Zion; he has stretched out a measuring line and did not hold back from destruction: thus, he made the ramparts and walls mourn; they wasted away together.
25:2:9/Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and shattered her bars: her king and her leaders are exiled among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets no longer receive visions from the LORD.
25:2:10/The elders of the daughter of Zion sit in silence on the ground; they have thrown dust on their heads and dressed in sackcloth: the young women of Jerusalem bow their heads to the ground in despair.
25:2:11/My eyes overflow with tears, my insides churn, my liver spills on the ground, because of the destruction of my people; as infants and babies faint in the city streets.
25:2:12/They ask their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like the wounded in the city streets, their lives ebbing away in their mothers' arms.
25:2:13/What can I say for you? To what can I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your breach is vast as the sea; who can heal you?
25:2:14/Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes, but have seen for you oracles that are false and misleading.
25:2:15/All who pass by clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"
25:2:16/All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and grind their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is indeed the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it."
25:2:17/The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown without pity; he has let the enemy gloat over you and exalted the horn of your foes.
25:2:18/The hearts of the people cry out to the LORD. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no rest, let your eyes not stop weeping.
25:2:19/Get up, cry out in the night, at the start of the night watches; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the LORD. Lift your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
25:2:20/See, O LORD, and consider! To whom have you done this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
25:2:21/Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young women and young men have fallen by the sword; you have slain them in the day of your anger, slaughtering without pity.
25:2:22/You have summoned as on a festival day my terrors on every side, and on the day of the LORD's anger, no one escaped or survived; those I had cared for and brought up, my enemy has destroyed.
25:3:1/I am the man who has experienced suffering under the weight of his anger.
25:3:2/He has led me into darkness without a glimpse of light.
25:3:3/Indeed, it feels like he has turned against me, attacking me all day long.
25:3:4/He has aged my skin and flesh; he has shattered my bones.
25:3:5/He has built barriers around me, surrounding me with bitterness and hardship.
25:3:6/He has placed me in pitch-black places, like those long dead.
25:3:7/He has trapped me so I can't escape; he has weighed me down with chains.
25:3:8/Even when I cry out and plead, he ignores my prayers.
25:3:9/He has blocked my path with stone walls; he has twisted my routes.
25:3:10/He has been like a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding.
25:3:11/He has diverted my path and torn me to pieces, leaving me devastated.
25:3:12/He has taken aim at me with his bow, making me the target for his arrows.
25:3:13/He has pierced my kidneys with the arrows from his quiver.
25:3:14/I have become a laughingstock to my people; they mock me in song all day long.
25:3:15/He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me intoxicated with wormwood.
25:3:16/He has also crushed my teeth with gravel; he has covered me with dust.
25:3:17/You have taken peace far from me; I have forgotten what prosperity is.
25:3:18/And I said, "My strength and my hope have vanished from the LORD."
25:3:19/Remembering my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the poison.
25:3:20/My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me.
25:3:21/Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope.
25:3:22/Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.
25:3:23/They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
25:3:24/The LORD is my portion, says my soul; therefore I will hope in him.
25:3:25/The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.
25:3:26/It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
25:3:27/It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.
25:3:28/He sits alone in silence, for he has taken it upon himself.
25:3:29/He puts his mouth in the dust; perhaps there is hope.
25:3:30/He offers his cheek to the one who would strike him; he is filled with disgrace.
25:3:31/For the LORD will not reject forever.
25:3:32/Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.
25:3:33/For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.
25:3:34/To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,
25:3:35/To deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High,
25:3:36/To wrong a person in his cause, the LORD does not approve.
25:3:37/Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?
25:3:38/Do not both calamity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?
25:3:39/Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?
25:3:40/Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.
25:3:41/Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven.
25:3:42/We have transgressed and rebelled; you have not forgiven.
25:3:43/You have enveloped yourself with anger and pursued us; you have killed without pity.
25:3:44/You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.
25:3:45/You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.
25:3:46/All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.
25:3:47/Fear and a trap have come upon us, devastation and destruction.
25:3:48/My eyes overflow with rivers of tears at the destruction of my people.
25:3:49/My eyes will flow without ceasing, without relief,
25:3:50/Until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.
25:3:51/My eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the women of my city.
25:3:52/My enemies hunted me down like a bird, without cause.
25:3:53/They silenced my life in the pit and threw stones at me.
25:3:54/Waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off."
25:3:55/I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.
25:3:56/You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."
25:3:57/You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."
25:3:58/O LORD, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.
25:3:59/O LORD, you have seen the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!
25:3:60/You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.
25:3:61/You have heard their insults, O LORD, all their plots against me.
25:3:62/The lips of my assailants and their whispering are against me all day long.
25:3:63/Look at their sitting and their rising; I am the object of their songs.
25:3:64/Pay them back, O LORD, according to their deeds.
25:3:65/Give them a tormented heart; may your curse be on them.
25:3:66/Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD.
25:4:1/How has the gold lost its shine! How has the purest gold changed! The sacred stones are scattered at the top of every street.
25:4:2/The noble sons of Zion, once worth their weight in fine gold, how are they now considered as mere clay pots, the work of a potter's hands!
25:4:3/Even sea monsters nurse their young, but the daughter of my people has become heartless, like ostriches in the desert.
25:4:4/The infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth from thirst; the children beg for bread, but no one gives them any.
25:4:5/Those who once ate delicacies are now destitute in the streets; those raised in luxury now cling to garbage piles.
25:4:6/The punishment of my people's sin is greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was destroyed in an instant without a hand laid on it.
25:4:7/Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, their bodies more radiant than rubies, their appearance as sapphire.
25:4:8/Now their faces are darker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin shrinks to their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.
25:4:9/Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger; the latter pine away, struck down by lack of food.
25:4:10/Compassionate women have cooked their own children; they became their food during the ruin of my people.
25:4:11/The LORD has fulfilled his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger. He has kindled a fire in Zion that has consumed its foundations.
25:4:12/The kings of the earth and all the world's inhabitants would not have believed that the enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
25:4:13/Because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous within her,
25:4:14/They wander blindly in the streets, polluted with blood, so that no one can touch their garments.
25:4:15/People shout at them, "Away! Unclean! Away, away! Do not touch!" So they flee and wander. Among the nations they say, "They can no longer stay here."
25:4:16/The LORD's anger has scattered them; he no longer looks upon them. They showed no respect for the priests and did not favor the elders.
25:4:17/As for us, our eyes have failed, looking in vain for help; we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
25:4:18/Our steps are tracked so that we cannot walk in our streets. Our end is near, our days are numbered, for our end has come.
25:4:19/Our pursuers are faster than eagles in the sky; they chase us over the mountains and lie in wait for us in the desert.
25:4:20/The breath of our nostrils, the LORD's anointed, was caught in their traps, of whom we said, "Under his shadow we will live among the nations."
25:4:21/Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But the cup will also pass to you; you will become drunk and strip yourself bare.
25:4:22/The punishment for your sins is complete, O daughter of Zion; he will no longer exile you. But he will punish your sins, O daughter of Edom; he will expose your wrongdoings.
25:5:1/Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us: look and see our disgrace.
25:5:2/Our heritage has been taken over by strangers, our homes by foreigners.
25:5:3/We are orphans without fathers, our mothers are like widows.
25:5:4/We have to buy our own water to drink; our wood comes at a price.
25:5:5/We are constantly persecuted: we work hard, but find no rest.
25:5:6/We have allied ourselves with the Egyptians and the Assyrians, just to have enough food.
25:5:7/Our ancestors sinned, and are no more; and we are left to bear their punishments.
25:5:8/Slaves have become our masters: there is no one to rescue us from their grip.
25:5:9/We risk our lives just to get our bread, because of the threat of violence in the wilderness.
25:5:10/Our skin is scorched as if by an oven, due to the severe famine.
25:5:11/Women in Zion were violated, and the young women in the towns of Judah.
25:5:12/Princes were hung by their hands; elders were shown no respect.
25:5:13/Young men were forced to grind grain, and children stumbled under heavy loads.
25:5:14/The elders no longer sit in the city gates, the young men have stopped their music.
25:5:15/The joy in our hearts has ended; our dancing has turned to mourning.
25:5:16/The crown has fallen from our head: woe to us, for we have sinned!
25:5:17/Because of this our hearts are sick; because of these things our eyes grow dim.
25:5:18/On the mountain of Zion, which lies desolate, foxes prowl over it.
25:5:19/You, O LORD, remain forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.
25:5:20/Why do you always forget us, and forsake us for so long?
25:5:21/Bring us back to you, O LORD, and we will return; renew our days as before.
25:5:22/But you have completely rejected us; you are extremely angry with us.
26:1:1/It happened in the thirtieth year, on the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens opened up, and I had visions of God.
26:1:2/On the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity,
26:1:3/The word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the LORD's hand was upon him there.
26:1:4/As I watched, a whirlwind came from the north, a huge cloud with fire engulfing itself and a brightness around it, and from the center, something that looked like glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire.
26:1:5/From within it came the forms of four living creatures. This was their appearance; they resembled humans.
26:1:6/Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.
26:1:7/Their legs were straight, and their feet were like the hooves of a calf, shining like polished bronze.
26:1:8/They had human hands under their wings on their four sides; and all four had faces and wings.
26:1:9/Their wings touched one another; they did not turn when they moved, each one went straight forward.
26:1:10/Regarding the appearance of their faces, each of the four had a human face, and on the right side, each had a lion's face, and on the left, an ox's face; all four also had an eagle's face.
26:1:11/That's how their faces looked. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another creature and two covering their bodies.
26:1:12/Each one moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved.
26:1:13/As for the appearance of the living creatures, they looked like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures, bright, and lightning flashed out of the fire.
26:1:14/And the living creatures darted back and forth like flashes of lightning.
26:1:15/While I was watching the living creatures, I saw one wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
26:1:16/The appearance of the wheels and their craftsmanship was like sparkling beryl, and all four had the same form. Their appearance and structure were as if one wheel were within another.
26:1:17/When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they moved.
26:1:18/Their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
26:1:19/When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were lifted up.
26:1:20/Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26:1:21/When those moved, these moved; when those stood still, these stood still; and when those were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26:1:22/Over the heads of the living creatures there was something like a vault, sparkling like ice, stretched out above their heads.
26:1:23/Under the vault, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two wings covering its body on one side and two covering its body on the other.
26:1:24/When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26:1:25/And there was a voice from above the vault over their heads when they stood still and lowered their wings.
26:1:26/Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a human.
26:1:27/I saw something that looked like glowing metal with fire encircling it from what appeared to be his waist up; and from what appeared to be his waist down, I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a brilliance around him.
26:1:28/Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
26:2:1/He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet, and I will speak to you."
26:2:2/As he spoke to me, the spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I listened to the one speaking to me.
26:2:3/He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been in rebellion against me to this very day.
26:2:4/They are defiant and stubborn. I am sending you to them, and you are to say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'
26:2:5/Whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26:2:6/And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words, even though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
26:2:7/You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.
26:2:8/But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you."
26:2:9/When I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me, and in it was a scroll.
26:2:10/He unrolled it before me, and it was written on both sides; on it were written words of lament, mourning, and woe.
26:3:1/He also said to me, "Human, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and then go and speak to the house of Israel."
26:3:2/So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll.
26:3:3/Then he told me, "Human, let your stomach consume, and fill your insides with this scroll I am giving you." So I ate it, and in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey.
26:3:4/He then instructed me, "Human, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them."
26:3:5/You are not being sent to people with a foreign tongue and a difficult language, but to the house of Israel;
26:3:6/Not to many peoples with foreign tongues and difficult languages, whose words you would not understand. Indeed, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
26:3:7/But the house of Israel will not listen to you because they are unwilling to listen to me; for all the house of Israel are stubborn and hard-hearted.
26:3:8/See, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.
26:3:9/I have made your forehead as hard as diamond, harder than flint. Do not fear them or be dismayed by their looks, even though they are a rebellious house.
26:3:10/Furthermore, he said to me, "Human, absorb all my words that I will speak to you into your heart, and listen closely with your ears.
26:3:11/And go to the exiles, to the children of your people, and speak to them. Tell them, 'This is what the Lord GOD says,' whether they listen or refuse to listen.
26:3:12/Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great roar, saying, "Praise the glory of the LORD from his place."
26:3:13/I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching each other, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and a great roaring sound.
26:3:14/So the spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the anger of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
26:3:15/Then I arrived among the exiles at Telabib, who lived by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and stayed there overwhelmed among them for seven days.
26:3:16/At the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:3:17/"Human, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. Therefore, listen to the word from my mouth and give them warning from me.
26:3:18/When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade the wicked from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26:3:19/However, if you do warn the wicked and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their wicked ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.
26:3:20/Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous acts they did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26:3:21/But if you warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself."
26:3:22/And the hand of the LORD was on me there, and he said to me, "Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak with you."
26:3:23/So I got up and went out to the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory I had seen by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.
26:3:24/Then the spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself inside your house.
26:3:25/But you, human, understand that they will put bands on you and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them.
26:3:26/And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.
26:3:27/But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Lord GOD says.' Let those who listen, listen, and let those who refuse, refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
26:4:1/You too, son of man, take a tile, place it in front of you, and draw on it the city of Jerusalem.
26:4:2/Surround it with a siege, build a rampart against it, and raise a siege mound against it; also set up a camp against it, and place battering rams around it.
26:4:3/Also, take an iron pan, and use it as an iron wall between you and the city: face it directly, and it will be under siege, and you will besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
26:4:4/Also, lie on your left side, and place the sin of the house of Israel upon it: for the number of days you lie on it, you will bear their sin.
26:4:5/For I have assigned to you the years of their sin, equal to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days: thus, you will bear the sin of the house of Israel.
26:4:6/And when you have completed these, lie again on your right side, and you will bear the sin of the house of Judah for forty days: I have assigned you each day for a year.
26:4:7/Therefore, you shall face the siege of Jerusalem, your arm shall be bare, and you shall prophesy against it.
26:4:8/And, look, I will put constraints on you, and you will not turn from one side to another until you have completed the days of your siege.
26:4:9/Also, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in a single container, and make bread from them for the number of days you will lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days you will eat it.
26:4:10/And the food you eat shall be measured, twenty shekels a day; you shall eat it at set times.
26:4:11/You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; you shall drink at set times.
26:4:12/And you shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it using human excrement in their presence.
26:4:13/And the LORD said, In this way, the children of Israel will eat their contaminated bread among the nations where I will drive them.
26:4:14/Then I said, Ah Lord GOD! Look, I have never been defiled: from my youth until now I have never eaten anything that died of itself or was torn by beasts; no detestable meat has ever entered my mouth.
26:4:15/Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's dung instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread with it.
26:4:16/Moreover, he said to me, Son of man, see, I will cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem: they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxiety; and they shall drink water by measure, and with dread.
26:4:17/So that they may lack bread and water, be shocked at each other, and waste away because of their sin.
26:5:1/And you, human, take a sharp knife, use a barber's razor, and shave your head and beard: then use scales to weigh and divide the hair.
26:5:2/You must burn a third of it in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are over: take another third and chop at it with a knife: and scatter the last third to the wind; and I will pursue them with a sword.
26:5:3/You should also take a few hairs and tie them in your clothes.
26:5:4/Then take some of those again, and throw them into the fire, and burn them in the fire; from them a fire will spread throughout all the house of Israel.
26:5:5/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; This is Jerusalem: I have placed it among the nations and countries around it.
26:5:6/And it has turned my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my laws more than the countries around it: for they have rejected my judgments and my laws, they have not followed them.
26:5:7/Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says; Because you have been more rebellious than the nations around you, not following my statutes or keeping my judgments, nor even following the practices of the nations around you;
26:5:8/Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says; Look, I am against you, and I will carry out judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
26:5:9/And I will do things to you that I have never done before, and will never do again, because of all your detestable practices.
26:5:10/Therefore parents will eat their children among you, and children will eat their parents; I will execute judgments on you, and scatter any survivors to the winds.
26:5:11/Therefore, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD; Surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile acts and detestable practices, I will also reduce you; my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity.
26:5:12/A third of you will die from disease, and be consumed by famine among you: a third will fall by the sword around you; and I will scatter a third to all the winds, and I will pursue them with a sword.
26:5:13/This way my anger will be fulfilled, and I will bring my fury to rest upon them, and I will be satisfied: and they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my zeal, when I have fulfilled my fury in them.
26:5:14/Moreover, I will make you desolate, and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
26:5:15/So you will be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury and with furious rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26:5:16/When I send the deadly arrows of famine against them, which will be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your supply of bread:
26:5:17/So I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless: and plague and blood will pass through you; and I will bring the sword against you. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26:6:1/And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
26:6:2/Son of man, turn your attention toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
26:6:3/And say, You mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord GOD; This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Look, I myself will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
26:6:4/Your altars will be deserted, and your idols will be shattered: and I will lay down your slain men in front of your idols.
26:6:5/And I will place the dead bodies of the children of Israel in front of their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
26:6:6/Throughout all your living places the cities will be ruined, and the high places will be desolate; so that your altars may be ruined and left desolate, and your idols may be broken and end, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be obliterated.
26:6:7/And the slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:6:8/Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who will escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries.
26:6:9/And those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive, because I am heartbroken over their promiscuous heart, which has turned away from me, and over their eyes, which lust after their idols: and they will loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their detestable acts.
26:6:10/And they will know that I am the LORD, and that I did not threaten in vain to bring this disaster upon them.
26:6:11/This is what the Lord GOD says; Clap your hands, and stomp your feet, and say, Alas for all the detestable acts of wickedness of the house of Israel! For they will fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
26:6:12/Those who are far away will die of the pestilence; those who are near will fall by the sword; and those who remain and are besieged will die by famine: this is how I will fulfill my anger upon them.
26:6:13/Then you will know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasing aromas to all their idols.
26:6:14/So I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their dwellings: and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:7:1/Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:7:2/Also, you, human, this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel; The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
26:7:3/The end has arrived for you, and I will unleash my anger upon you, and judge you based on your actions, and repay you for all your detestable practices.
26:7:4/And I will not look upon you with pity or spare you: I will repay you for your actions, and your detestable practices will be exposed among you: and you will realize that I am the LORD.
26:7:5/This is what the Lord GOD says; A disaster, a unique disaster, behold, is coming.
26:7:6/The end has come, the end is here: it waits for you; behold, it has arrived.
26:7:7/Dawn has come for you, O inhabitants of the land: the time has come, the day of trouble is near, without the echo of the mountains.
26:7:8/Soon I will pour out my fury on you, and fulfill my anger against you: and I will judge you according to your ways, and repay you for all your detestable practices.
26:7:9/And I will not look upon you with pity or spare you: I will repay you according to your actions and the detestable practices among you; and you will know that I am the LORD who strikes.
26:7:10/Look, the day is here, it has arrived: the morning has dawned; authority has flourished, arrogance has sprouted.
26:7:11/Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness: none of them will remain, nor their crowd, nor any of theirs: and there will be no mourning for them.
26:7:12/The time has come, the day is near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller grieve: for wrath is upon their entire crowd.
26:7:13/For the seller will not return to what has been sold, even though they are still alive: for the vision concerns the entire crowd, which will not return; nor will anyone strengthen themselves in their wrongdoing.
26:7:14/They have sounded the trumpet, readying everyone; but no one goes to battle: for my wrath is upon their entire crowd.
26:7:15/The sword is outside, and plague and famine are inside: whoever is in the field will die by the sword; and whoever is in the city, famine and plague will consume them.
26:7:16/But those who escape will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for their own sins.
26:7:17/All hands will be weak, and all knees will tremble like water.
26:7:18/They will also wear sackcloth, and terror will cover them; and shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.
26:7:19/They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be considered unclean: their silver and gold will not be able to save them on the day of the LORD's wrath: they will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs: because it has been the cause of their sin.
26:7:20/Regarding the beauty of his jewelry, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their detestable idols and vile things with it: therefore I have made it unclean for them.
26:7:21/And I will hand it over to strangers as plunder, and to the wicked of the earth as loot; and they will desecrate it.
26:7:22/I will also turn my face from them, and they will desecrate my treasured place: for invaders will enter and defile it.
26:7:23/Make a chain: for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence.
26:7:24/Therefore, I will bring the most ruthless of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses: I will also end the pride of the powerful, and their sacred places will be profaned.
26:7:25/Destruction is coming; and they will seek peace, but there will be none.
26:7:26/Calamity will follow calamity, and rumor will follow rumor; then they will seek a vision from the prophet; but the law will vanish from the priest, and advice from the elders.
26:7:27/The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble: I will treat them according to their conduct, and judge them as they deserve; and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:8:1/And it happened in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD suddenly came upon me.
26:8:2/Then I saw something that looked like fire: from his waist down it was all fire, and from his waist up it looked like a bright, shining light, the color of amber.
26:8:3/He reached out what seemed like a hand and grabbed me by my hair; the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky and took me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner gate facing north; where the idol that provokes jealousy was located.
26:8:4/And there, I saw the glory of the God of Israel, just like the vision I had seen in the plain.
26:8:5/Then he said to me, "Son of man, now look towards the north." So I looked northward, and there, at the entrance of the gate of the altar, was this idol that provokes jealousy.
26:8:6/He then said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing? The great detestable acts that the house of Israel is committing here, driving me far from my sanctuary? But turn again, and you will see even more detestable acts."
26:8:7/And he brought me to the entrance of the court; when I looked, there was a hole in the wall.
26:8:8/Then he said to me, "Son of man, dig into the wall." And when I dug into the wall, there was a door.
26:8:9/And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations they are committing here."
26:8:10/So I went in and saw; and there, depicted all around the wall, were all kinds of crawling creatures, detestable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
26:8:11/And there in front of them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, each with his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense was rising.
26:8:12/Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us; the LORD has abandoned the land.'"
26:8:13/He also said to me, "Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing."
26:8:14/Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and there, women were sitting, weeping for Tammuz.
26:8:15/Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, and you will see abominations greater than these."
26:8:16/And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and there, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.
26:8:17/Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial matter to the house of Judah to commit the abominations they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have again provoked me to anger: and see, they are putting the branch to their nose.
26:8:18/Therefore, I too will act in fury: my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not listen to them.
26:9:1/He also shouted in my ears with a loud voice, saying, "Call those in charge of the city to come here, each with his weapon of destruction in hand."
26:9:2/And look, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each carrying a weapon for slaughter; and among them was one man dressed in linen, with a writing kit at his side. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.
26:9:3/The glory of the God of Israel had moved from the cherubim, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man dressed in linen, who had the writing kit at his side.
26:9:4/And the LORD said to him, "Walk through the center of the city, through the center of Jerusalem, and mark the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things done within it."
26:9:5/To the others, He said in my hearing, "Follow him through the city and strike. Do not look with pity or spare anyone.
26:9:6/Kill completely the old and young, both girls, boys, and women, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Start at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.
26:9:7/He told them, "Defile the temple and fill its courts with the slain. Go out!" And they went out and killed throughout the city.
26:9:8/As they were killing, and I was the only one left, I fell facedown, crying out, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! Are you going to destroy all the remaining Israelites by pouring out your wrath on Jerusalem?"
26:9:9/He replied to me, "The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is soaked with blood and the city is full of corruption. They claim, 'The LORD has abandoned the land; the LORD does not see.'
26:9:10/As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I show pity, but I will bring their conduct down on their own heads."
26:9:11/Then the man dressed in linen, with the writing kit at his side, reported back, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."
26:10:1/Then I looked, and saw above the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, resembling a throne.
26:10:2/He instructed the man dressed in linen, "Go between the wheels, beneath the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, then scatter them over the city." And he did so in my presence.
26:10:3/Now the cherubim were on the right side of the house when the man entered; and the cloud filled the inner court.
26:10:4/Then the glory of the LORD rose from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the house; the house was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard shone with the brightness of the LORD's glory.
26:10:5/The sound of the cherubim's wings could be heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when he speaks.
26:10:6/When he had given the command to the man dressed in linen, "Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim," the man went in and stood beside the wheels.
26:10:7/One cherub reached out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between them, took some, and put it into the hands of the man in linen; who then took it and left.
26:10:8/Under their wings, the cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand.
26:10:9/When I looked, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The wheels looked as if they were made of beryl stone.
26:10:10/Their appearance was the same for all four, as if a wheel were inside another wheel.
26:10:11/When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they moved; they followed the direction the head faced, without turning as they moved.
26:10:12/Their entire body, backs, hands, wings, and the wheels, were covered with eyes all around, even the wheels of all four.
26:10:13/Regarding the wheels, I heard them being called "wheel" in my hearing.
26:10:14/Each one had four faces: the first was the face of a cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
26:10:15/The cherubim rose. This is the living creature I had seen by the river Chebar.
26:10:16/When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved with them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not turn away from them.
26:10:17/When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still; and when they rose, the wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creature was in them.
26:10:18/Then the glory of the LORD moved away from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.
26:10:19/The cherubim lifted their wings and rose from the ground in my sight. When they went out, the wheels were beside them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD's house, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.
26:10:20/This is the living creature I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I realized they were the cherubim.
26:10:21/Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands.
26:10:22/Their faces looked the same as those I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one moved straight ahead.
26:11:1/Furthermore, the spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the LORD's house, which faces east. There, at the gate's entrance, I saw twenty-five men, among them Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.
26:11:2/He then said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give harmful advice in this city:
26:11:3/They say, 'The disaster won't come soon; let's build houses. This city is our cooking pot, and we are the meat.'
26:11:4/So, prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man."
26:11:5/And the Spirit of the LORD came over me and told me to say, "This is what the LORD says: You have said this, O house of Israel, but I know every thought that crosses your mind.
26:11:6/You have increased the number of your dead in this city, filling its streets with them.
26:11:7/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The dead you have placed in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cooking pot; but I will take you out of it.
26:11:8/You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:11:9/And I will take you out from it, hand you over to strangers, and execute judgments upon you.
26:11:10/You will fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:11:11/This city will not be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat in it; I will judge you at the border of Israel:
26:11:12/And you will realize that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or carried out my judgments, but have conformed to the practices of the nations around you."
26:11:13/And as I was prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell face down, cried out loudly, and said, "Oh Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?"
26:11:14/Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:11:15/"Son of man, your brothers, your own family, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Get away from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.'"
26:11:16/Therefore, say, "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I have sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, I will be a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they have gone."
26:11:17/Therefore, say, "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the people and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."
26:11:18/When they return, they will remove all its vile images and detestable idols.
26:11:19/And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
26:11:20/So that they may follow my decrees and keep my laws and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
26:11:21/But as for those whose hearts pursue their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down on their own heads, says the Sovereign LORD."
26:11:22/Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26:11:23/And the glory of the LORD rose from within the city and stood on the mountain east of the city.
26:11:24/Afterward, the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. The vision I had seen left me.
26:11:25/Then I told the exiles all the things the LORD had shown me.
26:12:1/The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,
26:12:2/Son of man, you live among a rebellious people, who have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.
26:12:3/Therefore, you, son of man, pack your belongings for exile, and in their presence, move from one place to another, perhaps they will understand, despite being a rebellious people.
26:12:4/Then you must take your belongings out in their presence, as if you're preparing for exile; and in the evening, leave in their presence, as those going into captivity do.
26:12:5/In their view, break through the wall and take your belongings out through it.
26:12:6/You must carry it on your shoulders in their sight and take it out at dusk; cover your face so you do not see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.
26:12:7/And I did as I was commanded: I took out my belongings by day, as if going into captivity, and in the evening I broke through the wall with my hands; I took it out at dusk and carried it on my shoulder in their sight.
26:12:8/And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
26:12:9/Son of man, hasn't the house of Israel, the rebellious people, asked you, 'What are you doing?'
26:12:10/Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This message concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the people of Israel who are there.'
26:12:11/Say, 'I am your sign: just as I have done, so it will be done to them: they will go into exile, into captivity.'
26:12:12/And the prince among them will carry his belongings on his shoulder at dusk and leave; they will break through the wall to take their belongings out; he will cover his face so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes.
26:12:13/I will also spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my trap; I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, even though he will die there.
26:12:14/And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, along with all his troops; and I will draw the sword after them.
26:12:15/And they will know that I am the LORD when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries.
26:12:16/But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague so that they can tell of all their detestable practices among the nations where they go; then they will know that I am the LORD.
26:12:17/Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:12:18/Son of man, eat your bread with anxiety, and drink your water with trembling and with caution;
26:12:19/And say to the people of the land, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says about the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there.
26:12:20/And the inhabited cities will be destroyed, and the land will become desolate; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:12:21/And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
26:12:22/Son of man, what is that proverb you have in the land of Israel, saying, 'The days go by, and every vision comes to nothing'?
26:12:23/Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel.' But tell them, 'The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled.
26:12:24/For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
26:12:25/For I am the LORD; I will speak, and the word that I speak will come to pass; it will no longer be delayed. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and will perform it, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:12:26/Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.
26:12:27/Son of man, look, those of the house of Israel say, 'The vision he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies about times far off.'
26:12:28/Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I have spoken will be done, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:13:1/And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:13:2/Son of man, speak out against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and tell those who prophesy from their own hearts, Listen to the word of the LORD;
26:13:3/This is what the Lord GOD says; Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
26:13:4/O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts.
26:13:5/You have not stepped into the gaps, nor repaired the wall for the house of Israel to stand firm in the battle on the day of the LORD.
26:13:6/They have seen false visions and told lying divinations, claiming, The LORD says; when the LORD has not sent them; and they have led others to hope that they would confirm the word.
26:13:7/Have you not seen a false vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination, when you say, The LORD says it; even though I have not spoken?
26:13:8/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; Because you have spoken falsehoods and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says the Lord GOD.
26:13:9/And my hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, nor be listed in the records of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you will know that I am the Lord GOD.
26:13:10/Because they have misled my people, saying, Peace; when there was no peace; and one built a wall, and, look, others covered it with whitewash:
26:13:11/Tell those who cover it with whitewash that it will fall: there will be a torrential rain; and you, O great hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will break it.
26:13:12/Indeed, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the whitewash you applied?
26:13:13/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; I will break it down with a violent wind in my wrath; and there will be a torrential rain in my anger, and great hailstones in my wrath to destroy it.
26:13:14/So I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be exposed; it will fall, and you will perish in its midst: and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:13:15/Thus I will fulfill my wrath on the wall, and on those who have covered it with whitewash, and will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who whitewashed it;
26:13:16/Namely, the prophets of Israel who prophesy about Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, when there is no peace, says the Lord GOD.
26:13:17/Also, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy from their own hearts; and prophesy against them,
26:13:18/And say, This is what the Lord GOD says; Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists, and make veils for the heads of people of every height to ensnare lives! Will you ensnare the lives of my people, but preserve your own?
26:13:19/And will you profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to put to death those who should not die and to keep alive those who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies?
26:13:20/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; Behold, I am against your magic charms by which you hunt lives there like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the lives go, the lives you hunt like birds.
26:13:21/Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be in your hand to be hunted; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:13:22/Because you have disheartened the righteous with lies, when I had not made them sad; and encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and save his life:
26:13:23/Therefore, you will no longer see false visions nor practice divination: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:14:1/Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me.
26:14:2/And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:14:3/Son of man, these men have placed their idols in their hearts and have set the obstacle of their sin right before them: should I even be consulted by them?
26:14:4/So, talk to them and tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Every person from the house of Israel who sets up idols in their heart and places the obstacle of their sin before them, and then comes to the prophet; I, the LORD, will respond to them in accordance with their many idols,
26:14:5/So that I might confront the people of Israel in their own hearts, because they have all become estranged from me due to their idols.'
26:14:6/Therefore, tell the house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Repent and turn away from your idols; and turn your faces away from all your detestable practices.
26:14:7/For anyone from the house of Israel, or any foreigner living in Israel, who separates themselves from me, sets up idols in their heart, places the obstacle of their sin before them, and then comes to a prophet to inquire about me; I, the LORD, will answer them myself.
26:14:8/And I will set my face against that person, make them a warning and a proverb, and cut them off from among my people; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:14:9/And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from among my people Israel.
26:14:10/And they will bear the consequences of their sin: the punishment of the prophet will be the same as the punishment of the one who seeks guidance from him,
26:14:11/So that the house of Israel may no longer stray from me, nor be defiled anymore with all their sins; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:14:12/The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
26:14:13/Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a grave trespass, then I will stretch out my hand against it, cut off its supply of bread, send famine upon it, and eliminate both humans and animals from it.
26:14:14/Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:14:15/If I send wild beasts through the land and they ravage it, making it desolate so that no one can pass through because of the beasts,
26:14:16/Even if these three men were in it, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD, they could save neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.
26:14:17/Or if I bring a sword upon that land and command, 'Sword, go through the land,' so that I eliminate both humans and animals from it,
26:14:18/Even if these three men were in it, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD, they could save neither sons nor daughters, but only themselves would be saved.
26:14:19/Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath upon it through bloodshed, to cut off from it both humans and animals,
26:14:20/Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD, they could save neither son nor daughter; they would save only themselves by their righteousness.
26:14:21/For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: How much worse will it be when I send my four dreadful judgments against Jerusalem—the sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—to cut off from it both humans and animals?
26:14:22/Yet, look, there will be some survivors left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; they will come to you, and when you see their ways and their actions, you will be comforted concerning the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it.
26:14:23/And they will comfort you when you see their ways and their actions; and you will know that I have not done without reason all that I have done in it, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:15:1/And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
26:15:2/Son of man, what makes the vine tree special compared to any other tree, or compared to a branch found in the forests?
26:15:3/Can its wood be used for any meaningful work? Or will people use a piece of it to hang any object?
26:15:4/Look, it's thrown into the fire as fuel; the fire consumes both its ends, and its middle is charred. Is it suitable for any work then?
26:15:5/Consider, when it was intact, it was unfit for any work: how much more unfit will it be for any work when the fire has consumed it, and it is charred?
26:15:6/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says; Just as the vine tree among the forest trees, which I have designated for the fire as fuel, so will I treat the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
26:15:7/And I will set my face against them; they will escape from one fire, only for another fire to consume them; and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
26:15:8/And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:16:1/Once again, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:16:2/"Human, make Jerusalem aware of her detestable actions,
26:16:3/And tell her, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.
26:16:4/Regarding your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut, you were not washed with water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.
26:16:5/No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised.
26:16:6/Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, "Live!" Yes, I said to you as you lay in your blood, "Live!"
26:16:7/I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, you who were naked and bare.
26:16:8/Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine.
26:16:9/Then I bathed you with water, washed the blood from you, and anointed you with oil.
26:16:10/I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
26:16:11/I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck,
26:16:12/And I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
26:16:13/So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful and rose to be a queen.
26:16:14/Your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:16:15/But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his.
26:16:16/You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. Such things should not happen, nor should they ever occur.
26:16:17/You also took the beautiful jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them.
26:16:18/And you took your embroidered clothes to cover them, and you offered my oil and incense before them.
26:16:19/Also my food that I provided for you—fine flour, oil, and honey with which I fed you—you set before them as a pleasing aroma. And so it was, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:16:20/Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough?
26:16:21/You slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them.
26:16:22/In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.
26:16:23/After all your wickedness—'Woe, woe to you!' declares the Sovereign LORD—
26:16:24/You built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square.
26:16:25/At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by.
26:16:26/You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity.
26:16:27/So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct.
26:16:28/You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied.
26:16:29/Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied.
26:16:30/'How weak-willed you are,' declares the Sovereign LORD, 'when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute!
26:16:31/When you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute because you scorned payment.
26:16:32/You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband!
26:16:33/All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors.
26:16:34/So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you.
26:16:35/'Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD!
26:16:36/This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your lust and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood,
26:16:37/Therefore, I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved as well as all those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will expose your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
26:16:38/I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealousy.
26:16:39/Then I will hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare.
26:16:40/They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords.
26:16:41/They will burn down your houses and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women. I will put an end to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers.
26:16:42/Then my anger toward you will subside and my jealousy will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.
26:16:43/Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring your conduct down on your own head, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices?
26:16:44/Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: 'Like mother, like daughter.'
26:16:45/You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26:16:46/Your older sister is Samaria, who lives to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lives to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
26:16:47/Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their detestable practices. But, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.
26:16:48/As I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done what you and your daughters have done.
26:16:49/Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.
26:16:50/They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.
26:16:51/Samaria has not committed half the sins you have. You have multiplied your detestable practices beyond theirs and have justified your sisters by all the detestable things you have done.
26:16:52/You who judged your sisters bear your own shame for the sins you have committed, more detestable than theirs. They appear more righteous than you. So be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters seem righteous.
26:16:53/Yet I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them,
26:16:54/So that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort.
26:16:55/Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to what they were, and Samaria and her daughters will return to what they were, and you and your daughters will return to what you were.
26:16:56/Before your wickedness was uncovered, you acted more arrogantly than Sodom, which was not mentioned by your mouth in the days of your pride,
26:16:57/Before your evil was exposed. Now you are the scorn of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and the daughters of the Philistines—those all around who despise you.
26:16:58/You have borne the penalty of your lewdness and detestable practices, declares the LORD.
26:16:59/'For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant.
26:16:60/Yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
26:16:61/Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both your older and your younger; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of your covenant.
26:16:62/I will establish my covenant with you; and you will know that I am the LORD,
26:16:63/So that you may remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:17:1/And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:17:2/Son of man, present a riddle, and tell a parable to the house of Israel;
26:17:3/And say, This is what the Lord GOD says; A great eagle with large wings, long feathers, full of colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
26:17:4/It clipped off the top of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of trade; it placed it in a city of merchants.
26:17:5/It also took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fertile field; it set it by abundant waters, and positioned it like a willow tree.
26:17:6/And it grew, and became a sprawling vine of low height, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were beneath him: so it became a vine, and produced branches, and sprouted shoots.
26:17:7/There was also another great eagle with large wings and many feathers: and, look, this vine bent its roots toward him, and extended its branches toward him, so he might water it from the furrows of its planting.
26:17:8/It was planted in good soil by abundant waters, so it might grow branches, and bear fruit, to become a splendid vine.
26:17:9/Say, This is what the Lord GOD says; Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, so it withers? It will wither in all the leaves of its growth, even without great strength or many people to uproot it.
26:17:10/Indeed, being planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the beds where it grew.
26:17:11/Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:17:12/Tell the rebellious house, Don't you know what these things mean? tell them, Look, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem, and has taken its king and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon;
26:17:13/And has taken one of the king’s descendants, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath from him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:
26:17:14/So that the kingdom might be humble, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
26:17:15/But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, so they might give him horses and many people. Will he thrive? Can he escape who does such things? Or can he break the covenant, and yet be delivered?
26:17:16/As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king lives who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
26:17:17/Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything for him in the war, by building siege ramps and constructing fortifications to cut off many lives:
26:17:18/Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, look, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.
26:17:19/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will bring it back on his own head.
26:17:20/And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my trap, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will argue with him there about his violation that he has violated against me.
26:17:21/And all his escapees with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to all the winds: and you shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.
26:17:22/This is what the Lord GOD says; I will also take from the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will clip off from the top of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and prominent mountain:
26:17:23/In the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it: and it shall produce branches, and bear fruit, and become a magnificent cedar: and under it will dwell all kinds of birds; in the shade of its branches they will live.
26:17:24/And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have lifted up the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.
26:18:1/The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
26:18:2/Why do you use this proverb about the land of Israel, saying, "The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge"?
26:18:3/As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, you will no longer use this proverb in Israel.
26:18:4/Listen, every soul belongs to me; both the soul of the father and the soul of the son are mine. The soul that sins will die.
26:18:5/But if a person is righteous and practices justice and righteousness,
26:18:6/And does not participate in idolatrous feasts on the mountains, nor looks up to the idols of Israel, nor defiles his neighbor's wife, nor approaches a woman during her menstrual impurity,
26:18:7/And does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge, does not commit robbery, gives his food to the hungry, and clothes the naked,
26:18:8/Does not lend at interest or take any profit, refrains from injustice, judges fairly between one person and another,
26:18:9/Follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws, acting with integrity; such a person is righteous and will surely live, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:18:10/If this person has a son who becomes a violent thief, who sheds blood or does any of these other things,
26:18:11/Though the father does none of them—this son eats at the mountain shrines, defiles his neighbor's wife,
26:18:12/Oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not return what he took in pledge, looks up to the idols, commits detestable acts,
26:18:13/Lends at interest and takes profit; will such a person live? He will not! Since he has done all these detestable things, he will surely die; his blood will be on his own head.
26:18:14/Now suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father has done, sees them but does not do the same:
26:18:15/He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look up to the idols of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,
26:18:16/Does not oppress anyone, does not require a pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his food to the hungry and clothes the naked,
26:18:17/He refrains from oppressing the poor, does not lend at interest or take a profit, obeys my rules and follows my decrees; he will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live.
26:18:18/But his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, will indeed die for his sin.
26:18:19/Yet you ask, 'Why does not the son bear the guilt of the father?' When the son has done what is just and right, has kept all my decrees, and has done them, he will surely live.
26:18:20/The person who sins is the one who will die. A son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will a father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.
26:18:21/But if the wicked turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, they will surely live; they will not die.
26:18:22/None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live.
26:18:23/Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?
26:18:24/But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die.
26:18:25/Yet you say, 'The LORD's way is not fair.' Listen now, O house of Israel: Is my way unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
26:18:26/When a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die.
26:18:27/But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life.
26:18:28/Because they consider and turn away from all the transgressions they have committed, they will surely live; they will not die.
26:18:29/Yet the house of Israel says, 'The LORD's way is not fair.' O house of Israel, are my ways not fair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
26:18:30/Therefore, I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, so that sin will not be your downfall.
26:18:31/Cast away from you all the sins you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel?
26:18:32/For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live!
26:19:1/Moreover, express your sorrow for the leaders of Israel,
26:19:2/And ask, "What is your mother? A lioness: she lay among lions, she raised her cubs among young lions.
26:19:3/She raised one of her cubs: it grew into a young lion, and it learned to hunt; it consumed people.
26:19:4/The nations heard about him; he was caught in their trap, and they brought him with chains to Egypt.
26:19:5/When she realized she had waited in vain and her hope was gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
26:19:6/He roamed among the lions, became a young lion, learned to hunt, and consumed people.
26:19:7/He became familiar with their ruined palaces, and he destroyed their cities; the land was left desolate, echoing with his roars.
26:19:8/Then the nations surrounded him from all sides, set their trap, and he was caught.
26:19:9/They confined him in chains and took him to the king of Babylon; they imprisoned him so his roar would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.
26:19:10/Your mother is like a vine in your bloodline, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.
26:19:11/She had strong branches for the scepters of rulers, her height towered among the thick foliage, and she stood out with the multitude of her branches.
26:19:12/But she was uprooted in anger, thrown to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit; her strong branches were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
26:19:13/And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and parched land.
26:19:14/And a fire has come out from one of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong branch to be a scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation, and it will be used as a lamentation.
26:20:1/It happened in the seventh year, on the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that some of the elders of Israel came to seek guidance from the LORD, and sat before me.
26:20:2/Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:20:3/Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, 'This is what the Lord GOD says; Have you come to seek guidance from me? As surely as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be sought by you.
26:20:4/Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Make them aware of the detestable practices of their ancestors:
26:20:5/And tell them, 'This is what the Lord GOD says; On the day I chose Israel, and pledged my commitment to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and revealed myself to them in the land of Egypt, when I pledged my commitment to them, saying, I am the LORD your God;
26:20:6/On the day I pledged my commitment to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land I had scouted for them, flowing with milk and honey, the most splendid of all lands:
26:20:7/Then I told them, Discard every one of you the detestable things your eyes crave, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
26:20:8/But they rebelled against me, and refused to listen to me: they did not discard the detestable things their eyes craved, nor did they abandon the idols of Egypt: then I decided to pour out my wrath on them, to unleash my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
26:20:9/But I acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be dishonored in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I had made myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
26:20:10/Therefore, I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
26:20:11/And I gave them my laws, and showed them my decrees, which, if a person follows, they will live by them.
26:20:12/Also, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, so they would know that I am the LORD who makes them holy.
26:20:13/But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they did not follow my statutes, and they rejected my decrees, which, if a person follows, they will live by them; and they greatly desecrated my Sabbaths: then I decided to pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to destroy them.
26:20:14/But I acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be dishonored in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
26:20:15/Yet, I also pledged my commitment to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the most splendid of all lands;
26:20:16/Because they rejected my decrees, did not follow my statutes, but desecrated my Sabbaths: for their hearts pursued their idols.
26:20:17/Nevertheless, I spared them from destruction and did not put an end to them in the wilderness.
26:20:18/But I told their children in the wilderness, Do not follow the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their decrees, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
26:20:19/I am the LORD your God; follow my statutes, keep my decrees, and practice them;
26:20:20/And keep my Sabbaths holy; and they will be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
26:20:21/Yet the children rebelled against me: they did not follow my statutes, nor kept my decrees to practice them, which, if a person follows, they will live by them; they desecrated my Sabbaths: then I decided to pour out my wrath on them, to unleash my anger against them in the wilderness.
26:20:22/Nevertheless, I held back my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be dishonored in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
26:20:23/I also pledged my commitment to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
26:20:24/Because they had not carried out my decrees, but had rejected my statutes, and had desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers’ idols.
26:20:25/Therefore, I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live;
26:20:26/And I allowed them to become defiled through their own offerings, in making them offer by fire all their firstborn, that I might devastate them, so they would know that I am the LORD.
26:20:27/Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, 'This is what the Lord GOD says; In this also your ancestors blasphemed me, by acting treacherously against me.
26:20:28/For when I brought them into the land, which I had pledged to give them, then they saw every high hill and all the leafy trees, and they offered their sacrifices there, and there they presented their provocative offerings: there also they made their fragrant aromas, and poured out their drink offerings.
26:20:29/Then I asked them, What is the high place to which you go? And its name is called Bamah to this day.
26:20:30/Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Lord GOD says; Are you defiled in the same way as your ancestors? And do you engage in prostitution following their detestable practices?
26:20:31/For when you present your offerings, when you make your children pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day: and shall I be sought by you, O house of Israel? As surely as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be sought by you.
26:20:32/And what you have in mind will never happen, when you say, We will be like the nations, like the families of other countries, serving wood and stone.
26:20:33/As surely as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will rule over you with a mighty hand, an outstretched arm, and with poured-out wrath.
26:20:34/And I will bring you out from the peoples, and gather you from the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, an outstretched arm, and with poured-out wrath.
26:20:35/And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead with you face to face.
26:20:36/Just as I pleaded with your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will plead with you, says the Lord GOD.
26:20:37/And I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
26:20:38/And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who transgress against me: I will bring them out of the country where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel: and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:20:39/As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD; Go, serve every one of you his idols, and hereafter, if you will not listen to me: but no longer defile my holy name with your gifts, and with your idols.
26:20:40/For on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, will serve me: there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your sacred things.
26:20:41/I will accept you with your fragrant aromas, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered; and I will show myself holy among you in the sight of the nations.
26:20:42/And you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for which I pledged my commitment to give it to your ancestors.
26:20:43/And there you will remember your ways, and all your actions by which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done.
26:20:44/And you will know that I am the LORD when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways or your corrupt actions, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.
26:20:45/Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:20:46/Son of man, set your face toward the south, and speak against the south, and prophesy against the forest of the southern field;
26:20:47/And say to the forest of the south, Listen to the word of the LORD; This is what the Lord GOD says; Behold, I will ignite a fire in you, and it will consume every green tree and every dry tree in you: the blazing flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north will be scorched by it.
26:20:48/And all people will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it will not be quenched.
26:20:49/Then I said, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Isn't he just speaking in riddles?
26:21:1/And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:21:2/Son of man, turn your face toward Jerusalem, speak your message toward the sacred places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
26:21:3/And say to the land of Israel, This is what the LORD says; Look, I am against you, and I will draw my sword from its sheath, and I will eliminate both the righteous and the wicked from you.
26:21:4/Since I will eliminate both the righteous and the wicked from you, my sword will be unsheathed against all people from the south to the north:
26:21:5/So that everyone may know that I, the LORD, have drawn my sword from its sheath: it will not be sheathed again.
26:21:6/Therefore, son of man, groan with the breaking of your loins; and with bitterness groan in their presence.
26:21:7/And when they ask you, 'Why are you groaning?' you shall reply, 'Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, all hands will become weak, every spirit will faint, and every knee will be as weak as water. Behold, it is coming and will surely happen, says the Lord GOD.'
26:21:8/Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:21:9/Son of man, prophesy and say, This is what the LORD says; Say, 'A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished:
26:21:10/It is sharpened for a terrible slaughter; it is polished to flash like lightning! Should we then rejoice? It despises the scepter of my son, as it does all wood.
26:21:11/And it is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand: this sword is sharpened, and it is polished, to be given into the hand of the slayer.
26:21:12/Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people, it is against all the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword along with my people. Therefore, slap your thigh.
26:21:13/Because it is a testing, and what if even the scepter, which the sword despises, does not continue? says the Lord GOD.
26:21:14/Therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times, the sword for those to be killed. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them,
26:21:15/So that their hearts may melt, and many will fall at all their gates. I have prepared the slaughter; my sword has been made sharp, it is ready to consume.
26:21:16/Choose your path, go right or go left, wherever your face is directed.
26:21:17/I will also clap my hands together, and I will satisfy my fury. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26:21:18/The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
26:21:19/Also, you son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same country. And make a signpost, make it at the head of the way to the city.
26:21:20/Mark a road for the sword to come to Rabbath of the Ammonites and to Judah in fortified Jerusalem.
26:21:21/For the king of Babylon stands at the fork of the road, at the start of the two roads, to use divination. He shakes the arrows, he consults the household gods, he examines the liver.
26:21:22/At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set up battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a siege ramp, and to erect a wall.
26:21:23/And it will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn oaths to them, but he will remind them of their guilt, so that they can be captured.
26:21:24/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your rebellions are uncovered, so that in all your actions your sins appear—because you have come to memory, you will be captured by the hand.
26:21:25/And you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time for your final punishment,
26:21:26/This is what the Lord GOD says; Remove the turban, and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.
26:21:27/I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. And it shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is, and I will give it to him.
26:21:28/And you, son of man, prophesy and say, This is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their disgrace; even say, 'The sword, the sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is polished, to consume because of its gleaming.'
26:21:29/While they see false visions for you, while they divine lies to you, to place you on the necks of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come, the time for their final punishment.
26:21:30/Shall I return it to its sheath? I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your origin.
26:21:31/And I will pour out my indignation on you, I will blow against you with the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hands of brutal men, skilled in destruction.
26:21:32/You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land; you will not be remembered: for I, the LORD, have spoken.
26:22:1/Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
26:22:2/Now, you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, you will show her all her abominations.
26:22:3/Then say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The city spills blood within itself, hastening its own end, and crafts idols to defile itself.
26:22:4/You have become guilty by the blood you have shed; you have defiled yourself with the idols you have made; you have brought your days closer and have reached your years. Therefore, I have made you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all countries.
26:22:5/Those nearby and those far away from you will mock you, infamous and deeply troubled as you are.
26:22:6/See, the princes of Israel, each used their power within you to shed blood.
26:22:7/Within you, they have treated father and mother with contempt; they have oppressed the foreigner among you; they have wronged the orphan and the widow.
26:22:8/You have despised my sacred things and profaned my Sabbaths.
26:22:9/Within you are men who slander to shed blood; in your midst, they eat at the mountain shrines; they commit acts of indecency among you.
26:22:10/Within you, they have exposed their fathers' nakedness; within you, they have violated women during their menstrual impurity.
26:22:11/One commits detestable acts with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; and another within you violates his sister, his father's daughter.
26:22:12/Within you, they accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit, extorting your neighbors greedily, and you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:22:13/Behold, therefore, I have clapped my hands together at the dishonest profit you have made and at the bloodshed which has been among you.
26:22:14/Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will act.
26:22:15/And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and will purge your uncleanness from you.
26:22:16/And you will be profaned by your own actions in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:22:17/And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
26:22:18/Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
26:22:19/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have all become dross, behold, I will gather you into the heart of Jerusalem.
26:22:20/As silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my fury, and I will leave you there and melt you.
26:22:21/Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted within it.
26:22:22/As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted within it, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
26:22:23/And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
26:22:24/Son of man, say to her, 'You are the land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.'
26:22:25/There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they have devoured lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows within her.
26:22:26/Her priests have violated my law and profaned my holy things. They have not distinguished between the holy and the common; they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they have turned their eyes away from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
26:22:27/Her princes within her are like wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
26:22:28/And her prophets have covered them with whitewash, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' when the LORD has not spoken.
26:22:29/The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery; they have oppressed the poor and needy and have extorted from the foreigner without justice.
26:22:30/And I searched for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land, so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one.
26:22:31/Therefore, I have poured out my indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. Their own way I have brought upon their heads, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:23:1/The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
26:23:2/Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother:
26:23:3/They engaged in sexual immorality in Egypt; they were promiscuous since their youth: their breasts were fondled, and their virginity was violated there.
26:23:4/Their names were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: they belonged to me, and they had sons and daughters. Their names represent Samaria as Aholah, and Jerusalem as Aholibah.
26:23:5/Aholah was unfaithful while she was mine; she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbors,
26:23:6/Who were dressed in blue, commanders and officials, all of them handsome young men, horsemen riding on horses.
26:23:7/She engaged in sexual immorality with them, with all the elite men of Assyria, and with everyone she lusted after: she defiled herself with all their idols.
26:23:8/She didn't give up the sexual immorality she started in Egypt: for in her youth they slept with her, violated her virginity, and overwhelmed her with their immorality.
26:23:9/Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, whom she desired.
26:23:10/They exposed her nakedness: they took her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword: she became notorious among women; for they had executed judgment on her.
26:23:11/When her sister Aholibah saw this, she became even more depraved in her lust than her sister, and more promiscuous than her sister in her sexual immorality.
26:23:12/She lusted after the Assyrians her neighbors, commanders and officials dressed in splendid attire, horsemen riding on horses, all of them handsome young men.
26:23:13/Then I saw that she too was defiled; both took the same path.
26:23:14/But she increased her promiscuity: when she saw men depicted on the wall, images of the Chaldeans painted with vermilion,
26:23:15/Wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like Babylonian warriors, natives of Chaldea.
26:23:16/As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26:23:17/And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their sexual immorality, and she was polluted by them, and her desire for them waned.
26:23:18/So she revealed her promiscuity and exposed her nakedness: then my desire for her waned, just as my desire had waned for her sister.
26:23:19/Yet she multiplied her promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth, when she had been promiscuous in the land of Egypt.
26:23:20/For she lusted after their lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys, and whose emission was like that of horses.
26:23:21/You longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your breasts and violated your virginity.
26:23:22/Therefore, O Aholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
26:23:23/The Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, commanders and officials, great lords and renowned, all of them riding on horses.
26:23:24/They will attack you with chariots, wagons, and a host of people; they will set against you a siege of shields, helmets, and armor; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you by their standards.
26:23:25/And I will direct my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury: they will cut off your nose and your ears; and those who remain will fall by the sword: they will take your sons and daughters; and those who remain will be consumed by fire.
26:23:26/They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry.
26:23:27/Thus, I will put an end to your lewdness and your promiscuity brought from the land of Egypt, so you will not lift your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.
26:23:28/For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, into the hands of those from whom you have turned away in disgust:
26:23:29/And they will deal with you hatefully, take all your possessions, and leave you naked and bare: and the shame of your sexual immorality will be exposed, both your lewdness and your promiscuity.
26:23:30/I will do these things to you because you have chased after the nations and because you are defiled by their idols.
26:23:31/You have followed the path of your sister; therefore, I will put her cup into your hand.
26:23:32/This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You will drink your sister’s cup, a deep and wide one; you will be scorned and derided, for it holds much.
26:23:33/You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
26:23:34/You will drink it and drain it, then you will gnaw its fragments and tear your breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:23:35/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and promiscuity.
26:23:36/The LORD said to me; Son of man, will you judge Aholah and Aholibah? Yes, expose their detestable practices;
26:23:37/For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols and even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, passing them through the fire to consume them.
26:23:38/Moreover, they have done this to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and desecrated my Sabbaths.
26:23:39/For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, then they entered my sanctuary on the same day to desecrate it; and indeed, this is what they did in my house.
26:23:40/And furthermore, you sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came: for whom you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry,
26:23:41/And you sat on a majestic bed with a table prepared before it, on which you placed my incense and my oil.
26:23:42/The sound of a carefree crowd was with her; and with men of the common sort, Sabeans from the wilderness were brought in, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26:23:43/Then I said concerning her who had grown old in adulteries, ‘Now they will commit sexual immorality with her, and she with them.’
26:23:44/Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a prostitute: so they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the sexually immoral women.
26:23:45/But righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment due to adulteresses and with the judgment due to women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.
26:23:46/For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will bring a mob against them and hand them over to be terrorized and plundered.
26:23:47/And the mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
26:23:48/Thus, I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate your lewd behavior.
26:23:49/And they will repay you for your lewdness, and you will bear the sins of your idols; and you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.
26:24:1/Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:24:2/Son of man, note down the name of this day, this very day: the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem today.
26:24:3/Tell a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, This is what the Lord GOD says; Put a pot on, set it on, and also pour water into it.
26:24:4/Collect the pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the best bones.
26:24:5/Choose the best of the flock, and also burn the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let the bones of it simmer in it.
26:24:6/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot whose scum is in it, and whose scum has not been removed! Take it out piece by piece; let no lot be cast for it.
26:24:7/For its blood is in its midst; it placed it on the top of a rock; it did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.
26:24:8/So that it might provoke fury to take vengeance; I have placed its blood on the top of a rock, so that it would not be covered.
26:24:9/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; Woe to the city of bloodshed! I will even make the pile for the fire large.
26:24:10/Pile up wood, light the fire, cook the meat thoroughly, and season it well, and let the bones be burned.
26:24:11/Then place it empty on its coals, so that its metal may become hot and may burn, and that its impurities may melt in it, that its scum may be removed.
26:24:12/It has exhausted itself with lies, and its abundant scum did not go out of it; its scum shall be in the fire.
26:24:13/In your uncleanness is depravity: because I tried to cleanse you, and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed from your uncleanness anymore, until I have satisfied my fury on you.
26:24:14/I the LORD have spoken: it will happen, and I will do it; I will not hold back, nor will I spare, nor will I change my mind; according to your ways and your actions, they will judge you, says the Lord GOD.
26:24:15/Also, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:24:16/Son of man, see, I am about to take from you the delight of your eyes in a single stroke: yet you must not mourn or weep, nor let your tears flow.
26:24:17/Refrain from crying, do not mourn for the dead, keep your turban on your head, and your sandals on your feet, do not cover your face, and do not eat the food of mourners.
26:24:18/So I spoke to the people in the morning: and in the evening my wife died; and the next morning I did as I was commanded.
26:24:19/And the people asked me, Won't you tell us what these actions mean for us, that you are doing?
26:24:20/Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:24:21/Tell the house of Israel, This is what the Lord GOD says; See, I will desecrate my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.
26:24:22/And you will do as I have done: you will not cover your face, nor eat the food of mourners.
26:24:23/Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet: you will not mourn or weep; but you will waste away because of your sins, and mourn for each other.
26:24:24/Thus, Ezekiel is a sign to you: according to all that he has done, you will do: and when this comes, you will know that I am the Lord GOD.
26:24:25/Also, you son of man, will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the delight of their eyes, and the focus of their souls, their sons and daughters,
26:24:26/That someone who escapes on that day will come to you, to let you hear it with your own ears?
26:24:27/On that day your mouth will be opened to the one who has escaped, and you will speak and be no longer silent: and you will be a sign to them; and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:25:1/The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
26:25:2/Son of man, turn your attention toward the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
26:25:3/And tell the Ammonites, Listen to the word of the Lord GOD; This is what the Lord GOD says; Because you gloated over my sanctuary when it was defiled; and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste; and over the house of Judah when they were taken into captivity;
26:25:4/Therefore, I will hand you over to the people from the east to take over, and they will set up their palaces in you, and make their homes in you: they will eat your fruit, and they will drink your milk.
26:25:5/And I will turn Rabbah into a stable for camels, and the Ammonites into a resting place for flocks: and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:25:6/For this is what the Lord GOD says; Because you clapped your hands, stomped your feet, and rejoiced with all your scorn against the land of Israel;
26:25:7/Therefore, I will stretch out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations; and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to vanish from the countries: I will destroy you; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:25:8/This is what the Lord GOD says; Because Moab and Seir say, Look, the house of Judah is just like all the other nations;
26:25:9/Therefore, I will expose the flank of Moab from the cities, from his cities on his borders, the pride of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,
26:25:10/To the people of the east along with the Ammonites, and will give them as possession, so that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
26:25:11/And I will carry out judgments on Moab; and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:25:12/This is what the Lord GOD says; Because Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah and committed a grave offense by taking revenge on them;
26:25:13/Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says; I will also stretch out my hand against Edom, and will cut off both man and beast from it; and I will make it empty from Teman; and those from Dedan will fall by the sword.
26:25:14/And I will exact my vengeance on Edom through my people Israel: and they will act in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they will experience my vengeance, says the Lord GOD.
26:25:15/This is what the Lord GOD says; Because the Philistines acted out of revenge, and took vengeance with spite in their hearts, to destroy because of longstanding hatred;
26:25:16/Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says; Look, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remaining coastal people.
26:25:17/And I will unleash great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them.
26:26:1/On the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:26:2/Son of man, because Tyrus has mocked Jerusalem, saying, 'Aha, she is broken, the gateway of the peoples; she has turned to me; I will be filled, now that she is in ruins',
26:26:3/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says; 'I am against you, O Tyrus, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea brings its waves.
26:26:4/They will destroy the walls of Tyrus and tear down her towers; I will also remove her rubble and make her a bare rock.
26:26:5/She will become a place for spreading nets in the middle of the sea, for I have declared it,' says the Lord GOD; 'and she will become plunder for the nations.
26:26:6/And her outlying villages will be killed by the sword; then they will know that I am the LORD.
26:26:7/For this is what the Lord GOD says; 'Look, I am bringing against Tyrus Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a great army.
26:26:8/He will kill your outlying villages with the sword; he will build a siege ramp against you, construct a siege wall against you, and raise shields against you.
26:26:9/He will set up battering rams against your walls, and with his tools, he will demolish your towers.
26:26:10/Because of his horses' multitude, their dust will cover you; your walls will tremble at the noise of the cavalry, the wheels, and the chariots when he enters your gates as through a breach made in a city.
26:26:11/With the hooves of his horses, he will trample all your streets; he will kill your people by the sword, and your strong defenses will fall.
26:26:12/They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your luxurious homes; they will throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea.
26:26:13/I will stop the music of your songs; the sound of your harps will be heard no more.
26:26:14/And I will make you a bare rock; you will become a place to spread nets; you will never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD.
26:26:15/This is what the Lord GOD says to Tyrus; 'Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter is made in your midst?
26:26:16/Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment, and be appalled at you.
26:26:17/They will raise a lament for you and say to you, "How you are destroyed, city of renown, inhabited by seafaring people, strong on the sea, you and your inhabitants, who instilled fear in all who lived there!"
26:26:18/Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall; yes, the islands in the sea are terrified at your departure.
26:26:19/For this is what the Lord GOD says; 'When I make you a desolate city, like cities not inhabited; when I bring the deep upon you, and great waters cover you;
26:26:20/When I bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of long ago, and place you in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate from antiquity, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; and I will manifest glory in the land of the living;
26:26:21/I will make you a horror, and you will be no more; though you are sought for, you will never be found again,' declares the Lord GOD.
26:27:1/The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
26:27:2/Now, you, son of man, sing a lament for Tyre;
26:27:3/And tell Tyre, you who are located at the entrance of the sea, a merchant to many peoples on numerous islands, This is what the Lord GOD says; Oh Tyre, you have claimed, 'I am of unmatched beauty.'
26:27:4/Your territory is in the heart of the seas, your builders have brought your beauty to perfection.
26:27:5/They constructed all your decks with fir trees from Senir; they used cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you.
26:27:6/The oaks of Bashan were used for your oars; the people of Ashur made your benches of ivory, sourced from the islands of Chittim.
26:27:7/Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was what you spread as your sail; blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was what clothed you.
26:27:8/The people of Sidon and Arvad were your sailors: your wise men, O Tyre, within you, were your navigators.
26:27:9/The elders of Gebal and their wise men were within you as your caulkers: all the ships of the sea and their sailors were in you to trade your goods.
26:27:10/Those from Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, your warriors: they hung their shields and helmets in you; they enhanced your beauty.
26:27:11/The men of Arvad and your army were on your walls all around, and the Gammadims were in your towers: they hung their shields on your walls all around; they completed your beauty.
26:27:12/Tarshish was your merchant because of your wealth of goods; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded at your markets.
26:27:13/Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traders: they exchanged human lives and vessels of bronze in your marketplace.
26:27:14/Those from the house of Togarmah traded at your markets with horses, horsemen, and mules.
26:27:15/The people of Dedan were your traders; many islands were the source of your goods: they brought you as tribute horns of ivory and ebony.
26:27:16/Syria was your trader because of your abundant manufactured goods: they traded at your markets with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and agate.
26:27:17/Judah and the land of Israel, they were your traders: they traded in your markets with wheat from Minnith, Pannag, honey, oil, and balm.
26:27:18/Damascus was your trader in the abundance of your manufactured goods, for the wealth of all kinds of riches; with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
26:27:19/Dan and Javan, traveling back and forth, traded in your markets: bright iron, cassia, and calamus were among your merchandise.
26:27:20/Dedan was your trader in luxurious garments for chariots.
26:27:21/Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they traded with you in lambs, rams, and goats; these were your merchants.
26:27:22/The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your traders: they traded in your markets with the finest of all spices, precious stones, and gold.
26:27:23/Haran, Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your traders.
26:27:24/These were your traders in all kinds of merchandise, in blue garments, embroidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, secured with cords, made of cedar, among your goods.
26:27:25/The ships of Tarshish sang of your fame in your marketplace: and you were filled and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.
26:27:26/Your rowers brought you into great waters: the east wind has shattered you in the heart of the seas.
26:27:27/Your wealth, markets, goods, sailors, navigators, caulkers, those trading your merchandise, and all your warriors, that are within you, and all your company which is in your midst, shall fall into the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall.
26:27:28/The outskirts shall tremble at the sound of the cry of your navigators.
26:27:29/And all who handle the oar, the sailors, and all the sea pilots, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand on the land;
26:27:30/And shall raise their voices against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall throw dust on their heads, they shall roll in ashes:
26:27:31/And they shall shave themselves bald for you, and wear sackcloth, and they shall weep for you with deep sorrow and intense mourning.
26:27:32/And in their mourning they shall sing a lament for you, and lament over you, saying, 'What city is like Tyre, like the silenced in the midst of the sea?'
26:27:33/When your goods went out over the seas, you satisfied many peoples; you enriched the kings of the earth with the abundance of your wealth and goods.
26:27:34/In the time when you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters, your goods and all your company within you shall fall.
26:27:35/All the inhabitants of the islands shall be shocked at you, and their kings shall be terribly afraid, they shall be disturbed in their demeanor.
26:27:36/The merchants among the peoples shall hiss at you; you shall become a horror, and never shall you be anymore.
26:28:1/The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
26:28:2/Son of man, tell the prince of Tyrus, 'This is what the Lord GOD says: Because you are so proud and claim, "I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, surrounded by the seas," yet you are just a human, not a God, even though you think of yourself as a god:
26:28:3/Look, you think you're smarter than Daniel; no secret can be kept from you.
26:28:4/With your wisdom and understanding, you've amassed wealth, and filled your vaults with gold and silver.
26:28:5/Through your vast wisdom and trade, you've increased your wealth, and your heart has grown proud because of it.
26:28:6/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you've made your heart like the heart of a god;
26:28:7/Watch out, I'm going to bring foreigners against you, the most feared of nations. They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and tarnish your splendor.
26:28:8/They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
26:28:9/Will you still claim to be a god in the face of your killer? You will be mortal, not a god, in the hands of those who strike you down.
26:28:10/You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have declared it, says the Lord GOD.
26:28:11/Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
26:28:12/Son of man, sing a lament for the king of Tyrus, and tell him, 'This is what the Lord GOD says: You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26:28:13/You were in Eden, the garden of God; adorned with every precious stone—ruby, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold. Your music and craftsmanship were prepared on the day you were created.
26:28:14/You were the anointed guardian cherub. I placed you on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones.
26:28:15/You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until wickedness was found in you.
26:28:16/Through your widespread trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.
26:28:17/Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
26:28:18/You desecrated your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities and the dishonesty of your trade. Therefore, I will bring forth a fire from within you; it will consume you, and I will reduce you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who watch you.
26:28:19/All who knew you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have become a horror and will be no more.
26:28:20/Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
26:28:21/Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
26:28:22/And say, 'This is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in your midst. And they will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in you and show myself holy in you.
26:28:23/For I will send disease and bloodshed into your streets, and the wounded will fall within you, with the sword against you on all sides. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26:28:24/And there will no longer be a prickling brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from all those around them who despise them. And they will know that I am the Lord GOD.
26:28:25/This is what the Lord GOD says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.
26:28:26/They will live there securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will live in safety, when I execute judgments on all their neighbors who despise them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.
26:29:1/In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
26:29:2/Son of man, confront Pharaoh king of Egypt, and deliver a prophecy against him and all of Egypt: 
26:29:3/Say this: 'This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the mighty dragon lying in the rivers, who claims, "The river is mine; I made it for myself."'
26:29:4/But I will put hooks in your jaws, and make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. I will pull you out from your rivers, with all the fish sticking to your scales.
26:29:5/And I will leave you stranded in the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. You will fall on the open fields; you will not be collected or gathered. I have given you as food to the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky.
26:29:6/And all the people of Egypt will realize that I am the LORD, because they have been a weak support to the house of Israel.
26:29:7/When they grasped you by the hand, you broke and tore their shoulder; and when they leaned on you, you broke and made their backs stiff.
26:29:8/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am bringing a sword against you, and will eliminate both people and animals from you.
26:29:9/And the land of Egypt will become desolate and ruined; and they will know that I am the LORD: because you claimed, "The river is mine; I made it."
26:29:10/So, I am against you and your rivers, and I will turn the land of Egypt into complete ruin, from the tower of Syene to the border of Ethiopia.
26:29:11/No human or animal will pass through it, nor will it be inhabited for forty years.
26:29:12/And I will make the land of Egypt desolate among desolate countries, and her cities among ruined cities will be desolate for forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.
26:29:13/Yet, this is what the Lord GOD says: After forty years, I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.
26:29:14/And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the place of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom.
26:29:15/It will be the lowest of kingdoms and will not assert itself above the nations anymore. I will reduce them so they will no longer dominate the nations.
26:29:16/And Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the house of Israel, reminding them of their wrongdoing when they turn to them. But they will know that I am the Lord GOD.
26:29:17/And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
26:29:18/Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army work hard against Tyre: every head was shaved, and every shoulder was rubbed raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from Tyre for the effort they put into it.
26:29:19/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am giving the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will carry off its wealth, seize its goods, and take its plunder; that will be the wages for his army.
26:29:20/I have given him the land of Egypt as payment for his labor, because they worked for me, says the Lord GOD.
26:29:21/On that day, I will make the power of the house of Israel grow, and I will enable you to speak out among them; and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:30:1/The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
26:30:2/Son of man, prophesy and say, This is what the Lord GOD says; Cry out, 'Alas for the day!'
26:30:3/For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it will be a time of judgment for the nations.
26:30:4/And the sword will come upon Egypt, and great pain will be in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in Egypt, and they take away her multitude, and her foundations are broken down.
26:30:5/Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, all the mixed peoples, Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, will fall with them by the sword.
26:30:6/This is what the LORD says; Those who support Egypt will fall; and the pride of her power will come down: from the tower of Syene they will fall in it by the sword, says the Lord GOD.
26:30:7/And they will be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities will be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
26:30:8/And they will know that I am the LORD, when I set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers are destroyed.
26:30:9/On that day, messengers will go forth from me in ships to frighten the complacent Ethiopians, and great pain will come upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, look, it comes.
26:30:10/This is what the Lord GOD says; I will also end the multitude of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
26:30:11/He and his people with him, the most feared of the nations, will be brought to destroy the land: and they will draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
26:30:12/And I will dry up the rivers, and sell the land into the hands of the wicked: and I will make the land desolate, and all that is in it, by the hand of foreigners: I the LORD have spoken it.
26:30:13/This is what the Lord GOD says; I will also destroy the idols, and I will make their images cease out of Noph; and there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt: and I will instill fear in the land of Egypt.
26:30:14/And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.
26:30:15/And I will pour out my fury upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will eliminate the multitude of No.
26:30:16/And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin will be in great pain, and No will be torn apart, and Noph will face distresses daily.
26:30:17/The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth will fall by the sword: and these cities will go into captivity.
26:30:18/At Tehaphnehes also the day will be darkened, when I break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pride of her strength will end in her: as for her, a cloud will cover her, and her daughters will go into captivity.
26:30:19/Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:30:20/And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
26:30:21/Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, look, it will not be bound up to be healed, to put a splint to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.
26:30:22/Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
26:30:23/And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
26:30:24/And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he will groan before him with the groanings of a fatally wounded man.
26:30:25/But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall down; and they will know that I am the LORD, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out upon the land of Egypt.
26:30:26/And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:31:1/And it happened in the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:31:2/Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Who do you think you compare to in your greatness?
26:31:3/Look, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and a shadowing canopy, towering high; its top was among the dense branches.
26:31:4/The waters made him grow, the deep lifted him up with its rivers flowing around his base, sending out streams to all the trees of the field.
26:31:5/So his height was higher than all the trees of the field, his branches grew thick, and his shoots extended because of the abundant waters.
26:31:6/All the birds of the sky nested in his branches, and under his branches all the wild animals gave birth, and under his shade lived all great nations.
26:31:7/So he was magnificent in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his roots were beside abundant waters.
26:31:8/Not even the cedars in the garden of God could overshadow him: the fir trees did not match his branches, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; no tree in the garden of God was as beautiful as he.
26:31:9/I made him beautiful with his many branches: so that all the trees of Eden, in the garden of God, envied him.
26:31:10/Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says; Because you have grown tall in stature, and he has raised his top among the dense branches, and his heart is proud of his height;
26:31:11/I have handed him over to a mighty nation; he will surely deal with him: I have expelled him for his wickedness.
26:31:12/And foreigners, the most fearsome of nations, have cut him down, leaving him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have fallen, and his limbs are broken by all the streams of the land; and all the people of the earth have left his shade and abandoned him.
26:31:13/On his fallen trunk will all the birds of the sky rest, and all the wild animals will climb on his branches:
26:31:14/So that no trees by the waters grow proud of their height, nor raise their tops among the dense branches, nor stand tall in their height, all those that drink water: for they are all destined for death, to the depths of the earth, among mortals, with those who go down to the pit.
26:31:15/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; On the day he was brought down to the grave I caused mourning: I covered the deep for him, and held back its streams, and the great waters were stopped: and I made Lebanon mourn for him, and all the trees of the field wilted for him.
26:31:16/I caused the nations to tremble at the sound of his fall, when I sent him down to the grave with those who descend into the pit: and all the choice trees of Eden, the best of Lebanon, all that drink water, will be consoled in the depths of the earth.
26:31:17/They also descended to the grave with him, to those killed by the sword; and those who were his support, who lived under his shadow among the nations.
26:31:18/Who then are you like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth: you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:32:1/And it happened in the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:32:2/Son of man, sing a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, You are like a young lion among the nations, and like a whale in the seas: you surged forth with your rivers, stirred up the waters with your feet, and muddied their rivers.
26:32:3/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; I will therefore spread my net over you with a group of many people; and they will haul you up in my net.
26:32:4/Then I will leave you on the land, I will throw you out into the open field, and will make all the birds of the sky settle on you, and I will satisfy the wild animals of the entire earth with you.
26:32:5/And I will spread your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your remains.
26:32:6/I will also drench the land with your blood, up to the mountains; and the riverbeds will be full of you.
26:32:7/And when I extinguish you, I will cover the skies, and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with clouds, and the moon will not shine.
26:32:8/All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you, and bring darkness upon your land, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:32:9/I will also trouble the hearts of many people, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into countries you have not known.
26:32:10/Indeed, I will make many people shocked at you, and their kings will shudder with fear because of you, when I brandish my sword before them; and they will tremble every moment, each one fearing for his own life, on the day of your downfall.
26:32:11/For this is what the Sovereign LORD says; The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you.
26:32:12/By the swords of the mighty I will make your multitude fall, the most fearsome of the nations, all of them: and they will plunder the splendor of Egypt, and all its multitude will be destroyed.
26:32:13/I will also eliminate all its animals from beside the great waters; no human foot will stir them again, nor will the hooves of animals disturb them.
26:32:14/Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to flow smoothly, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:32:15/When I make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country is stripped of everything it contained, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am the LORD.
26:32:16/This is the lament they will chant for her: the daughters of the nations will chant it; for Egypt and all her multitude they will chant it, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:32:17/It also happened in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:32:18/Son of man, mourn for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, her and the daughters of majestic nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:19/Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised.
26:32:20/They will fall among those slain by the sword: she is handed over to the sword: pull her and all her multitudes.
26:32:21/The strong among the mighty will speak to him from the depths of the grave with those who helped him: they have gone down, they lie still, slain by the sword.
26:32:22/Asshur is there and all her company; their graves surround him, all of them slain, fallen by the sword:
26:32:23/Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is all around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living.
26:32:24/There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who spread their terror in the land of the living; yet they have borne their disgrace with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:25/They have made her a bed among the slain with all her multitude; her graves surround him; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword. Despite causing terror in the land of the living, they have borne their disgrace with those who go down to the pit; he is placed among those who are slain.
26:32:26/There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves surround him; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
26:32:27/And they will not lie with the warriors who fell of the uncircumcised, who went down to the grave with their weapons of war, placing their swords under their heads, but their sins rest on their bones, even though they were once the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
26:32:28/Yes, you will be shattered among the uncircumcised, and will lie with those slain by the sword.
26:32:29/There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who despite their might are laid with those slain by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:30/There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain; in spite of the terror their might inspired, they are ashamed of their power; and they lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and bear their disgrace with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:31/Pharaoh will see them and will be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:32:32/For I have spread my terror in the land of the living: and he will be laid to rest among the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:33:1/Once again, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:33:2/Human, speak to your people and tell them, 'When I send a sword against a land, and the people of the land choose someone from their outskirts to be their watchman,
26:33:3/If he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,
26:33:4/Then anyone who hears the trumpet but doesn't heed the warning, if the sword comes and takes them away, their blood will be on their own head.
26:33:5/They heard the sound of the trumpet but didn't take warning; their blood will be on them. However, those who take warning will save their lives.
26:33:6/But if the watchman sees the sword coming and doesn't blow the trumpet, so the people aren't warned, and the sword comes and takes someone from among them, that person is taken away because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman responsible for their blood.
26:33:7/So you, human, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore, listen to what I say and warn them for me.
26:33:8/When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you don't speak out to warn the wicked from their ways, that wicked person will die in their sin, but I will hold you responsible for their blood.
26:33:9/However, if you do warn the wicked to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die in their sin, but you will have saved yourself.
26:33:10/Therefore, human, tell the house of Israel, 'You say, "Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?"'
26:33:11/Tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?'
26:33:12/Therefore, human, say to your people, 'The righteousness of the righteous will not save them when they continue to commit sins, and the wickedness of the wicked will not cause them to stumble when they turn from their wickedness. And the righteous will not be able to live by their righteousness when they sin.'
26:33:13/When I tell the righteous that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and commit sin, none of their righteous deeds will be remembered; because of the sin they have committed, they will die.
26:33:14/Again, when I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' if they turn from their sin and do what is just and right,
26:33:15/If the wicked give back what they took in pledge, return what they have stolen, follow the decrees that give life, and do no evil, they will surely live; they will not die.
26:33:16/None of the sins they have committed will be held against them; they have done what is just and right; they will surely live.
26:33:17/Yet your people say, 'The Lord's way is not fair,' but it is their own way that is not fair.
26:33:18/When the righteous turn from their righteousness and commit iniquity, they will die because of it.
26:33:19/But if the wicked turn from their wickedness and do what is just and right, they will live by doing so.
26:33:20/Yet you say, 'The Lord's way is not fair.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to your own ways.
26:33:21/In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, someone who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, 'The city has been captured.'
26:33:22/The hand of the LORD was on me that evening, before the escapee arrived; He had opened my mouth, so when the man came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent.
26:33:23/Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:33:24/Human, those living in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as a possession.'
26:33:25/Therefore tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You eat meat with the blood still in it, you look to your idols, and you shed blood; should you then possess the land?
26:33:26/You rely on your swords, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land?'
26:33:27/Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, those in the ruins will fall by the sword, those in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of disease.
26:33:28/I will make the land utterly desolate, and its proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be so desolate that no one will dare to pass through them.
26:33:29/Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolate wasteland because of all the detestable things they have done.'
26:33:30/Also, human, your people are talking about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, 'Come and hear the message that has come from the LORD.'
26:33:31/They come to you as people do, they sit before you as my people, and they listen to your words, but they do not put them into practice. With their mouths they express devotion, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain.
26:33:32/Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice.
26:33:33/When all this comes true—and it surely will—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26:34:1/And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:34:2/Son of man, prophesy against the leaders of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, This is what the Lord GOD says to the leaders; Woe to the leaders of Israel who only take care of themselves! Shouldn't the leaders take care of the people?
26:34:3/You consume the best parts for yourselves, and you dress in the finest clothes, you slaughter the well-fed animals: but you do not take care of the people.
26:34:4/You have not strengthened the weak, nor have you healed the sick, nor bound up the injured, nor brought back the strays, nor sought the lost; but with harshness and brutality you have ruled over them.
26:34:5/And they were scattered, because there is no leader: and they became prey to all the wild animals when they were scattered.
26:34:6/My people wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill: yes, my people were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them.
26:34:7/Therefore, you leaders, hear the word of the LORD;
26:34:8/As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely because my people became prey, and my people became food for every wild animal, because there was no leader, nor did my leaders search for my people, but the leaders took care of themselves, and did not feed my people;
26:34:9/Therefore, O leaders, hear the word of the LORD;
26:34:10/This is what the Lord GOD says; Look, I am against the leaders; and I will demand my people from them, and stop them from feeding the people; the leaders shall not feed themselves anymore; for I will rescue my people from their mouths, so they may not be food for them.
26:34:11/For this is what the Lord GOD says; Look, I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.
26:34:12/As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
26:34:13/And I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them on the mountains of Israel by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
26:34:14/I will feed them in good grazing land, and their pasture will be on the high mountains of Israel. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
26:34:15/I will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Lord GOD.
26:34:16/I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice.
26:34:17/And as for you, my flock, this is what the Lord GOD says; I will judge between one sheep and another, between rams and goats.
26:34:18/Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
26:34:19/And as for my flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet and drink what you have muddied with your feet.
26:34:20/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says to them; See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26:34:21/Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have scattered them abroad;
26:34:22/Therefore, I will save my flock, and they will no longer be prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
26:34:23/And I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them and be their shepherd.
26:34:24/And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David will be a prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.
26:34:25/And I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests safely.
26:34:26/And I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing.
26:34:27/The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops, and they will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them.
26:34:28/They will no longer be prey to the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live securely, and no one will make them afraid.
26:34:29/And I will provide for them a renowned planting place, and they will no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the scorn of the nations anymore.
26:34:30/Thus they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord GOD.
26:34:31/And you my flock, the flock of my pasture, are people, and I am your God, declares the Lord GOD.
26:35:1/Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:35:2/"Human, turn your face towards Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
26:35:3/And tell it, 'This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, O Mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand against you, making you utterly desolate.
26:35:4/I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will be desolate, and you will realize that I am the LORD.
26:35:5/Because you have harbored an everlasting hatred and have spilled the blood of the children of Israel by the sword during their time of disaster, when their guilt had reached its end,
26:35:6/Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will destine you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will follow you. Since you did not despise bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
26:35:7/So I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, cutting off from it anyone who comes and goes.
26:35:8/And I will fill its mountains with the dead; on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your streams, those killed by the sword will fall.
26:35:9/I will subject you to endless ruin; your cities will not be inhabited again. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26:35:10/Because you claimed, 'These two nations and these two countries will be mine, and we will take possession of them,' even though the LORD was there,
26:35:11/Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will act in accordance with your anger and jealousy which you showed in your hatred towards them. I will make myself known to them when I judge you.
26:35:12/And you will realize that I am the LORD. I have heard all the insults you have hurled against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'They are desolate; they are given to us to devour.'
26:35:13/With your mouth, you have boasted against me and multiplied your words against me; I have heard them.
26:35:14/This is what the Lord GOD says: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
26:35:15/Just as you rejoiced at the desolation of the territory of the house of Israel, so I will do to you: you will be desolate, O Mount Seir, and all of Idumea, the whole of it. And they will know that I am the LORD.
26:36:1/Also, you, human, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, 'Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the LORD:
26:36:2/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; Because the enemy has said about you, 'Aha, even the ancient high places belong to us now':
26:36:3/Therefore, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says; Because you have been made desolate and surrounded on all sides, so that you became a possession for the rest of the nations and have become the subject of gossip and scorn:
26:36:4/Therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD; This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns, which have become plunder and mockery to the remaining nations around you:
26:36:5/This is why the Sovereign LORD says; In the heat of my jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who took my land for themselves with joyful hearts and with spiteful minds, to plunder its pasturelands.'
26:36:6/Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says; Look, I have spoken in my jealousy and anger because you have endured the scorn of the nations:
26:36:7/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says; I swear that the nations around you will themselves endure their own shame.
26:36:8/But you, mountains of Israel, will put forth your branches and bear your fruit for my people Israel; they are soon to come home.
26:36:9/See, I am on your side; I will turn toward you, and you will be cultivated and sown:
26:36:10/And I will increase the population upon you, the whole house of Israel, all of it; the towns will be resettled, and the ruins rebuilt:
26:36:11/And I will increase both people and animals on you; they will multiply and be fruitful: and I will settle you as in your former times, and will do more good for you than ever before; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:36:12/Yes, I will lead people to walk on you, my people Israel; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them of their people.
26:36:13/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; Because they say to you, 'You land devour people and bereave your nations':
26:36:14/Therefore, you will no longer devour people nor make your nations childless, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:36:15/I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you bear disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you cause your nations to stumble any more, declares the Sovereign LORD."
26:36:16/Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:36:17/Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their actions and their conduct; their ways were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity to me.
26:36:18/So I poured out my wrath on them because of the blood they had shed on the land and because they had defiled it with their idols.
26:36:19/And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their way and according to their actions I judged them.
26:36:20/And when they went to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to leave his land.'
26:36:21/But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they had gone.
26:36:22/Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says; It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
26:36:23/And I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Sovereign LORD, when I show myself holy through you before their eyes.
26:36:24/For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land.
26:36:25/Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
26:36:26/I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
26:36:27/And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
26:36:28/Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.
26:36:29/I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you.
26:36:30/I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine.
26:36:31/Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices.
26:36:32/Understand that it is not for your sake I am doing this, says the Sovereign LORD. Be ashamed and disgraced for your ways, O house of Israel.
26:36:33/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt.
26:36:34/The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.
26:36:35/They will say, 'This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; and the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited.'
26:36:36/Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it.
26:36:37/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; I will also let the house of Israel ask me to do this for them: I will increase their people like a flock.
26:36:38/Like the sacred flock, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals, so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26:37:1/The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,
26:37:2/And led me around them all over: and, look, there were a great many in the open valley; and, indeed, they were very dry.
26:37:3/And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, only you know.
26:37:4/Then he said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and tell them, O you dry bones, listen to the word of the LORD.
26:37:5/This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones; Look, I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life:
26:37:6/And I will attach tendons to you, and make flesh grow on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you will come to life; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26:37:7/So I prophesied as I was instructed: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and look a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
26:37:8/And as I watched, look, the tendons and the flesh appeared on them, and skin covered them from above: but there was no breath in them.
26:37:9/Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, This is what the Lord GOD says; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.
26:37:10/So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them, and they came to life, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
26:37:11/Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones represent the whole house of Israel: look, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is gone; we are completely cut off.
26:37:12/Therefore prophesy and say to them, This is what the Lord GOD says; Look, O my people, I will open your graves and bring you up from them, and bring you back to the land of Israel.
26:37:13/And you will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, O my people, and bring you up from them,
26:37:14/And I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land: then you will know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD.
26:37:15/The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
26:37:16/Moreover, you son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions:
26:37:17/And join them together into one stick; and they will become one in your hand.
26:37:18/And when the people ask you, 'Won't you tell us what you mean by these?'
26:37:19/Tell them, This is what the Lord GOD says; Look, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his allies, and join them with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand.
26:37:20/And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
26:37:21/And tell them, This is what the Lord GOD says; Look, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them into their own land:
26:37:22/And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king to them all: and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided into two kingdoms anymore.
26:37:23/They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their sins: but I will save them from all their dwelling places where they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so they will be my people, and I will be their God.
26:37:24/And David my servant will be king over them; and they all will have one shepherd: they will also follow my laws, and observe my statutes, and do them.
26:37:25/And they will live in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, where your ancestors lived; and they will live there, they, and their children, and their children's children forever: and my servant David will be their prince forever.
26:37:26/Furthermore, I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will establish them, and increase their numbers, and will set my sanctuary among them forever.
26:37:27/My dwelling place will also be with them; yes, I will be their God, and they will be my people.
26:37:28/And the nations will know that I the LORD make Israel holy, when my sanctuary is among them forever.
26:38:1/The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26:38:2/"Human, set your sights against Gog, of the land of Magog, the top prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
26:38:3/And say, 'This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am against you, Gog, the top prince of Meshech and Tubal:
26:38:4/I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and lead you out with all your army, horses, and horsemen, fully armed, a huge force with shields and armor, all wielding swords:
26:38:5/Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya will join you; all of them armed with shields and helmets:
26:38:6/Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops—many peoples with you.
26:38:7/Get ready, prepare yourself, you and all the crowds gathered around you, and take charge of them.
26:38:8/After a long time, you will be called into action. In the future years, you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people have been gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety.
26:38:9/You will advance like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you.'
26:38:10/This is what the Lord GOD says: 'At that time, ideas will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme.
26:38:11/You will say, "I will invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people—all of them living without walls and without gates and bars.
26:38:12/You will plunder and loot, turn your hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the nations, rich in livestock and goods, living at the center of the land."
26:38:13/Sheba and Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all its young lions will ask you, "Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil?"
26:38:14/Therefore, human, prophesy and say to Gog, "This is what the Lord GOD says: On that day when my people Israel are living securely, will you not take notice?
26:38:15/You will come from your place in the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army.
26:38:16/You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the days to come, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes, O Gog."
26:38:17/This is what the Lord GOD says: "Are you the one I spoke of in former days by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them?
26:38:18/But on the day when Gog attacks the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, my fury will rise.
26:38:19/For in my zeal and in the fire of my wrath I declare that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
26:38:20/So that the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, all the creatures that move along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble, and every wall will fall to the ground.
26:38:21/I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. Every man's sword will be against his brother.
26:38:22/I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many peoples with him.
26:38:23/Thus I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26:39:1/Therefore, you, human, prophesy against Gog, and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Look, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
26:39:2/And I will turn you around, leaving only a sixth of you, and will bring you from the north, and place you on the mountains of Israel:
26:39:3/I will knock your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
26:39:4/You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the people with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals.
26:39:5/You will fall in the open field, for I have declared it, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:39:6/I will send fire on Magog and on those who live securely in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the LORD.
26:39:7/So I will make my holy name known among my people Israel; I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
26:39:8/It is coming, and it will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD. This is the day I have spoken of.
26:39:9/Those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and set fire to and burn the weapons, the shields and bucklers, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel.
26:39:10/They will not need to take wood from the field or cut down any from the forests, for they will use the weapons for fuel. They will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:39:11/On that day, I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east toward the sea. It will block the way of travelers, because there Gog and all his hordes will be buried. It will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.
26:39:12/For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
26:39:13/All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that I display my glory, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:39:14/They will designate men to regularly pass through the land, burying those who remain on the surface of the ground, to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will begin their search.
26:39:15/As the travelers pass through the land, if anyone sees a human bone, they will set up a marker beside it until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog.
26:39:16/And also the name of the city will be Hamonah. Thus they will cleanse the land.
26:39:17/And you, human, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Call to every kind of bird and all the wild animals, 'Assemble and come, gather from all around to my sacrificial meal that I am preparing for you, a great feast on the mountains of Israel, where you can eat flesh and drink blood.
26:39:18/You will eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, all of them fattened animals of Bashan.
26:39:19/You will eat fat until you are full and drink blood until you are drunk, at my sacrificial meal which I have prepared for you.
26:39:20/At my table you will be filled with horses and charioteers, with warriors and all kinds of fighting men,' declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:39:21/I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the judgment I have executed and the hand I have laid on them.
26:39:22/From that day forward the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.
26:39:23/And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin, because they were unfaithful to me, so I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.
26:39:24/I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and I hid my face from them.
26:39:25/Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have compassion on the whole house of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name.
26:39:26/After they have borne their shame and all their unfaithfulness by which they were unfaithful to me, when they live securely in their land with no one to make them afraid,
26:39:27/When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from the lands of their enemies, and am proved holy through them in the sight of many nations,
26:39:28/Then they will know that I am the LORD their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind.
26:39:29/I will no longer hide my face from them, for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:40:1/In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the start of the year, on the tenth day of the month, fourteen years after the city was taken, on that very day the hand of the LORD was on me, and he took me there.
26:40:2/In a vision from God, he took me to the land of Israel and placed me on a very high mountain, where there was something like the structure of a city to the south.
26:40:3/He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze, holding a linen cord and a measuring rod; he was standing in the gateway.
26:40:4/And the man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I'm going to show you; for you were brought here so I could show them to you. Report everything you see to the house of Israel."
26:40:5/And I saw a wall surrounding the temple area, and in the man's hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the height, one rod.
26:40:6/Then he went to the gate facing east, climbed its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide; and the other threshold was also one rod wide.
26:40:7/Each guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; between the guardrooms was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end was one rod.
26:40:8/He also measured the vestibule of the gate on the inside, one rod.
26:40:9/Then he measured the vestibule of the gate, eight cubits; and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was on the inside.
26:40:10/And the guardrooms of the gate facing east were three on one side and three on the other, all three having the same measurements; and the jambs on both sides had the same measurement.
26:40:11/He measured the width of the entrance of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
26:40:12/There was a barrier of one cubit in front of the guardrooms on one side and a barrier of one cubit on the other side; the guardrooms were six cubits on one side and six cubits on the other side.
26:40:13/Then he measured the gate from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of another; the width was twenty-five cubits, door opposite door.
26:40:14/He also made posts of sixty cubits; even to the post of the courtyard all around the gate.
26:40:15/And from the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
26:40:16/There were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms and toward their posts within the gate all around, and similarly for the arches. And there were windows all around inside, and on each post were palm tree decorations.
26:40:17/Then he brought me into the outer court, and there were chambers and a pavement made all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
26:40:18/And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
26:40:19/Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court on the outside, one hundred cubits on the east and on the north.
26:40:20/And the gate of the outer court that faced north, he measured its length and its width.
26:40:21/Its guardrooms, three on this side and three on that side, its posts and its arches, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.
26:40:22/Its windows, its arches, and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as the gate facing east; seven steps led up to it, and its archway was in front of them.
26:40:23/And the gate of the inner court was opposite the gate to the north and to the east; he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.
26:40:24/Then he led me to the south, and there was a gate facing south; he measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements.
26:40:25/And there were windows in it and in its arches all around like those windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:40:26/Seven steps led up to it, and its archway was in front of them; it had palm trees on its posts, one on this side and one on that side.
26:40:27/And there was a gate in the inner court facing south; he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.
26:40:28/He brought me to the inner court through the south gate; he measured the south gate according to these measurements.
26:40:29/Its guardrooms, its posts, and its arches according to these measurements; and there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26:40:30/And the arches around it were twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
26:40:31/Its arches faced the outer court; palm trees were on its posts, and eight steps led up to it.
26:40:32/He brought me into the inner court toward the east; he measured the gate according to these measurements.
26:40:33/Its guardrooms, its posts, and its arches were according to these measurements; and there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26:40:34/Its arches faced the outer court; palm trees were on its posts, on this side and on that side; and eight steps led up to it.
26:40:35/He brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these measurements.
26:40:36/Its guardrooms, its posts, and its arches, and the windows all around; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:40:37/Its posts faced the outer court; palm trees were on its posts, on this side and on that side; and eight steps led up to it.
26:40:38/And the chambers and their entrances were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
26:40:39/In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering on.
26:40:40/And on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
26:40:41/Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables on which they slaughtered their sacrifices.
26:40:42/And the four tables for the burnt offering were made of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they placed the instruments used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.
26:40:43/And hooks, a handbreadth wide, were fastened all around inside; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.
26:40:44/Outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their outlook was toward the south, one at the side of the east gate having the outlook toward the north.
26:40:45/And he said to me, "This chamber, facing south, is for the priests who are responsible for the temple.
26:40:46/And the chamber facing north is for the priests who are responsible for the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, who are from the sons of Levi and come near to the LORD to serve Him."
26:40:47/So he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square; and the altar was in front of the temple.
26:40:48/He brought me to the porch of the temple and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on one side and three cubits on the other side.
26:40:49/The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps by which they went up to it; and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.
26:41:1/Afterward, he took me to the temple and measured the doorposts, each six cubits wide on both sides, matching the width of the tabernacle.
26:41:2/The doorway was ten cubits wide; the sides of the doorway were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other. He measured its length at forty cubits and its width at twenty cubits.
26:41:3/Then he moved inward and measured the doorpost at two cubits; the door at six cubits; and the doorway's width at seven cubits.
26:41:4/He measured its length at twenty cubits and its width at twenty cubits, in front of the temple, and told me, "This is the most holy place."
26:41:5/Next, he measured the wall of the building, six cubits thick; and the width of each side room around the building was four cubits.
26:41:6/The side rooms were on three levels, thirty in total, and they were inserted into the wall of the building so the rooms were connected around the building, but they did not extend into the wall itself.
26:41:7/There was an expansion and a winding staircase going upward to the side rooms because the winding staircase of the building went upward around the entire building. Thus, the width of the building increased from the lowest room to the highest through the middle.
26:41:8/I also saw the height of the building all around: the foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six large cubits.
26:41:9/The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area left was the space for the side rooms inside the building.
26:41:10/And between the rooms was a space of twenty cubits around the building on all sides.
26:41:11/The doors of the side rooms opened onto the area left free, one door facing north and another door facing south. The free space was five cubits wide all around.
26:41:12/The building facing the separated area at the west end was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.
26:41:13/So he measured the building, a hundred cubits long; and the separated area, and the building, with its walls, were also a hundred cubits long.
26:41:14/Also, the width of the front of the building and the separated area to the east was a hundred cubits.
26:41:15/He measured the length of the building facing the separated area at the back and the galleries on both sides at a hundred cubits, including the inner temple and the porches of the courtyard.
26:41:16/The doorposts, the narrow windows, and the galleries around their three levels, opposite the door, were paneled with wood all around, from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered.
26:41:17/Above the door, up to the inner room, and on the outside, and on all the walls around inside and outside, was measured.
26:41:18/It was decorated with cherubim and palm trees, with a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub had two faces.
26:41:19/So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side; it was made throughout the entire house.
26:41:20/From the ground to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were made, and on the temple wall.
26:41:21/The temple doorposts were squared, and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance.
26:41:22/The wooden altar was three cubits high and its length two cubits; its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, "This is the table that stands before the LORD."
26:41:23/The temple and the sanctuary each had two doors.
26:41:24/And the doors each had two folding leaves, two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other.
26:41:25/On the doors of the temple were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden canopy on the outside of the porch.
26:41:26/There were narrow windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch, and on the side rooms of the building, and the wooden canopies.
26:42:1/Then he led me out into the outer courtyard, the path leading northward: and he took me to the room that faced the separate area, directly in front of the building to the north.
26:42:2/The north entrance was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
26:42:3/Opposite the twenty cubits reserved for the inner courtyard, and opposite the pavement meant for the outer courtyard, was a three-story gallery facing another gallery.
26:42:4/In front of the rooms was a walkway ten cubits wide on the inside, and the pathway was one cubit wide; their doors faced north.
26:42:5/The upper rooms were shorter because the galleries took up more space than those below or in the middle of the building.
26:42:6/They were spread over three stories but didn't have pillars like those in the courtyards: therefore, there was less space than at the lowest and middle levels from the ground.
26:42:7/And the external wall, opposite the rooms toward the outer courtyard at the front of the rooms, was fifty cubits long.
26:42:8/The length of the rooms in the outer courtyard was fifty cubits: and, look, in front of the temple it was a hundred cubits.
26:42:9/The entrance to these rooms was from the east as one enters them from the outer courtyard.
26:42:10/The rooms were part of the wall's thickness of the courtyard to the east, opposite the separate area, and opposite the building.
26:42:11/And the path in front of them was similar to the appearance of the rooms facing north, as long as they were and as wide as they were: and all their exits were both according to their designs, and according to their doors.
26:42:12/And like the doors of the rooms that were toward the south, there was a door at the head of the path, the path directly in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them.
26:42:13/Then he said to me, "The north rooms and the south rooms, which are in front of the separate area, are sacred rooms where the priests who come near to the LORD will eat the most sacred offerings: there they will place the most sacred offerings, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; because the place is holy.
26:42:14/When the priests enter there, they shall not leave the holy place to go into the outer courtyard without changing their garments that they serve in; for they are holy. They must put on other clothes before they go near the areas for the people."
26:42:15/After he finished measuring the inner temple, he took me out through the gate that faces east and measured it all around.
26:42:16/He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods, by the measuring rod all around.
26:42:17/He measured the north side, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod all around.
26:42:18/He measured the south side, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod.
26:42:19/He turned to the west side and measured five hundred rods with the measuring rod.
26:42:20/He measured it on all four sides: it had a wall all around, five hundred rods long and five hundred rods wide, to separate the sacred from the common.
26:43:1/Afterward, he led me to the gate, the gate facing east:
26:43:2/And I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the earth glowed with his brilliance.
26:43:3/It was just like the vision I had seen, the same vision I had when I came to destroy the city, and like the visions I had by the river Chebar; and I fell facedown.
26:43:4/The glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate facing east.
26:43:5/Then the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and I saw that the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
26:43:6/And I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple while a man stood beside me.
26:43:7/He told me, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will live among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will no longer defile my holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and the corpses of their kings at their high places.
26:43:8/When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger.
26:43:9/Now let them put away their prostitution and the corpses of their kings far from me, and I will live among them forever.
26:43:10/You, son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection.
26:43:11/And if they are ashamed of all they have done, show them the design of the temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design and all its regulations and laws. Write it down in their sight so that they may follow its design and all its regulations and carry them out.
26:43:12/This is the law of the temple: The whole area surrounding the mountaintop is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.
26:43:13/Here are the measurements of the altar in cubits (each cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): The base shall be a cubit high and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. This is the height of the altar.
26:43:14/From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, with a width of one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the width one cubit.
26:43:15/The altar hearth shall be four cubits high, and from the altar hearth extending upwards shall be four horns.
26:43:16/The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square on its four sides.
26:43:17/The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide on its four sides; the rim around it shall be half a cubit, and its base shall be one cubit all around. Its steps shall face east.
26:43:18/He said to me, "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: These are the regulations for the altar on the day it is constructed for offering burnt offerings on it and for sprinkling blood on it.
26:43:19/You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the priests, the Levites who are from the offspring of Zadok, who approach me to minister to me, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:43:20/You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and on the rim all around. Thus you shall purify it and make atonement for it.
26:43:21/You shall also take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the designated part of the temple, outside the sanctuary.
26:43:22/On the second day, you shall offer a male goat without defect as a sin offering, and they shall purify the altar as they did with the bull.
26:43:23/When you finish purifying it, you shall offer a young bull without defect and a ram from the flock without defect.
26:43:24/You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the LORD.
26:43:25/For seven days you shall prepare a goat for a sin offering each day. They shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.
26:43:26/For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they shall consecrate it.
26:43:27/And when these days are over, on the eighth day and thereafter, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:44:1/Then he led me back to the gate of the outer sanctuary facing east, but it was closed.
26:44:2/Then the LORD said to me, "This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened, and no one is to enter through it because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore, it must stay shut.
26:44:3/It is reserved for the prince. The prince himself may sit in it to eat a meal before the LORD. He must enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way."
26:44:4/Then he took me to the north gate in front of the temple. I looked, and the glory of the LORD filled the LORD's temple, and I fell facedown.
26:44:5/And the LORD said to me, "Son of man, pay close attention, see with your eyes, and listen with your ears to everything I tell you about all the regulations and laws of the LORD's temple. Take note of the entrance to the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary.
26:44:6/Tell the rebellious house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Enough of all your detestable practices, house of Israel,
26:44:7/when you brought foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while you offered my food, the fat, and the blood. You broke my covenant with all your detestable practices.
26:44:8/You have not kept charge of my holy things but have appointed others to keep charge of my sanctuary for you.
26:44:9/This is what the Sovereign LORD says: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, is to enter my sanctuary, including any foreigner living among the Israelites.
26:44:10/Even the Levites who strayed away from me when Israel went astray, who strayed away from me after their idols, must bear the consequences of their sin.
26:44:11/Yet they will serve in my sanctuary, overseeing the gates of the temple and serving in the temple; they will slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people to serve them.
26:44:12/Because they served them in front of their idols and led the house of Israel into sin, therefore I have sworn against them, declares the Sovereign LORD, and they will bear their guilt.
26:44:13/They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or the most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices.
26:44:14/Yet I will make them responsible for the upkeep of the temple, for all its work, and for everything done in it.
26:44:15/But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who faithfully performed the duties of my sanctuary when the Israelites strayed from me, are to come near to serve me; they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:44:16/They are to enter my sanctuary, approach my table to serve me, and carry out my requirements.
26:44:17/When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while serving at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple.
26:44:18/They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them sweat.
26:44:19/When they go out to the outer court where the people are, they must take off the clothes they have been serving in and leave them in the holy rooms. They are to put on other clothes so they do not consecrate the people with their garments.
26:44:20/They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long; they are only to trim their hair.
26:44:21/No priest is to drink wine when they enter the inner court.
26:44:22/They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may only marry virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel, or widows of priests.
26:44:23/They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
26:44:24/In legal disputes, they are to stand as judges, and judge it according to my judgments. They are to keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed festivals, and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy.
26:44:25/They must not defile themselves by going near a dead person. However, they may defile themselves for a father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or an unmarried sister.
26:44:26/After he is cleansed, they must count off seven days for him.
26:44:27/On the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to serve in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:44:28/This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance. You are to give them no property in Israel; I am their property.
26:44:29/They will eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them.
26:44:30/The best of all the firstfruits and of all your special gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give them the first portion of your ground meal so that a blessing may rest on your household.
26:44:31/The priests must not eat anything, bird or beast, that has died naturally or been torn by wild animals.
26:45:1/Furthermore, when you divide the land for inheritance by lot, you must present an offering to the LORD, a sacred portion of the land: its length will be twenty-five thousand cubits, and its width ten thousand. This area will be sacred throughout all its borders.
26:45:2/From this area, a section for the sanctuary will measure five hundred by five hundred cubits, forming a square all around; and there will be a fifty-cubit open space around it.
26:45:3/From this specified area, you will measure a length of twenty-five thousand and a width of ten thousand cubits: within it will be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
26:45:4/The sacred portion of the land will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to serve the LORD: it will provide space for their homes and a sacred area for the sanctuary.
26:45:5/And the area measuring twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width will also be for the Levites, the ministers of the temple, for their own possession, to accommodate twenty chambers.
26:45:6/You must designate the city's land allocation as five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand cubits long, adjacent to the sacred offering: it will be for the entire house of Israel.
26:45:7/A portion will be allocated for the prince on both sides of the sacred offering and the city's land, in front of the sacred offering and the city's land, from the west side to the east side: and the length will match one of the portions, from the western border to the eastern border.
26:45:8/This land will be his possession in Israel: and my princes will no longer oppress my people; the rest of the land will be given to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
26:45:9/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; Enough, O princes of Israel: stop violence and destruction, and do what is just and right. Remove your demands from my people, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:45:10/You must use accurate scales, and fair ephah and bath measures.
26:45:11/The ephah and the bath must be of the same size, so that the bath contains a tenth of a homer, and the ephah also a tenth of a homer; the standard measurement will be based on the homer.
26:45:12/And the shekel will be twenty gerahs: your maneh will consist of twenty shekels, plus twenty-five shekels, plus fifteen shekels.
26:45:13/This is the offering you are to present: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and you are to give a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.
26:45:14/Regarding the oil measurement, you are to offer a tenth of a bath from a cor, which is a homer of ten baths; for ten baths make a homer.
26:45:15/And one lamb from the flock, out of every two hundred, from the rich pastures of Israel; for a grain offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Sovereign LORD.
26:45:16/All the people of the land are to contribute this offering for the prince in Israel.
26:45:17/It will be the prince's responsibility to provide burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the festivals, the new moons, and the Sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.
26:45:18/This is what the Sovereign LORD says; On the first day of the first month, you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary.
26:45:19/The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the altar's ledge, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.
26:45:20/And you are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance. So you will make atonement for the temple.
26:45:21/On the fourteenth day of the first month, you are to celebrate the Passover, a festival lasting seven days, during which you shall eat bread made without yeast.
26:45:22/On that day, the prince is to provide for himself and all the people of the land a bull as a sin offering.
26:45:23/For the seven days of the festival, he is to provide a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams without defect each day for the seven days, and a male goat each day for a sin offering.
26:45:24/He is to provide a grain offering of an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:45:25/On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he is to do the same during the seven-day festival, according to the sin offering, burnt offering, grain offering, and oil.
26:46:1/The Lord GOD says: The gate of the inner court facing east will be closed during the six working days; however, it will be opened on the sabbath and on the day of the new moon.
26:46:2/The prince will enter through the porch of that gate from the outside, and will stand by the gatepost, while the priests prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He will worship at the gate's threshold, then he will leave, but the gate will remain open until the evening.
26:46:3/Similarly, the people of the land will worship at the entrance of this gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and the new moons.
26:46:4/The burnt offering that the prince will present to the LORD on the sabbath day will consist of six lambs without any defects, and a ram without any defects.
26:46:5/The grain offering will be an ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs will be whatever he can afford, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:6/On the day of the new moon, the offering will be a young bull without any defects, six lambs, and a ram, all without any defects.
26:46:7/He will prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs whatever he can afford, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:8/When the prince enters, he will do so through the porch of that gate, and he will exit the same way.
26:46:9/But when the people of the land come before the LORD during the appointed festivals, anyone entering through the north gate to worship must exit through the south gate; and anyone entering through the south gate must exit through the north gate. They must not return through the gate they entered but must go straight ahead.
26:46:10/The prince will be among them, entering when they enter and leaving when they leave.
26:46:11/During the festivals and the solemn assemblies, the grain offering will be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs whatever he can afford, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:12/Whenever the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings to the LORD, the gate facing east will be opened for him. He will offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he will leave, and the gate will be shut after him.
26:46:13/You must daily offer to the LORD a burnt offering of a lamb of the first year without any defects; this must be done every morning.
26:46:14/Every morning, you must also prepare a grain offering to accompany it, consisting of one-sixth of an ephah and one-third of a hin of oil to mix with the fine flour. This is a continual grain offering to the LORD, to be observed forever.
26:46:15/This is how the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil must be prepared every morning as a regular burnt offering.
26:46:16/The Lord GOD says: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it will become their inheritance; it will belong to them by right.
26:46:17/However, if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to the servant only until the year of freedom; after that, it will return to the prince. But his inheritance will belong to his sons permanently.
26:46:18/The prince must not take any of the people's inheritance by force, displacing them from their property; instead, he must provide for his sons from his own property, so that my people are not displaced from their own possessions.
26:46:19/He then led me through the entrance beside the gate into the sacred rooms for the priests, which faced north. There, I saw a place at the western end.
26:46:20/He said to me, "This is where the priests will cook the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people."
26:46:21/He then took me out to the outer court and led me around its four corners. I noticed that each corner of the court had a smaller court.
26:46:22/In the four corners of the court, there were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size.
26:46:23/There was a row of buildings around the inside of these courts, and under these buildings were places for cooking.
26:46:24/He said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the sacrifices of the people."
26:47:1/Afterward, he took me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing from beneath the threshold of the temple towards the east, since the temple faced east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.
26:47:2/Then he led me out through the north gate and around to the outer east gate, and I saw water trickling from the south side.
26:47:3/As the man with the measuring line went eastward, he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankle-deep.
26:47:4/He measured another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured another thousand and led me through water that was waist-deep.
26:47:5/After measuring another thousand, it became a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that could not be crossed on foot.
26:47:6/He asked me, "Do you see this, son of man?" Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
26:47:7/When I returned, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the riverbank.
26:47:8/He explained to me, "These waters flow towards the eastern region, go down into the desert, and enter the sea. When they reach the sea, the water there becomes fresh.
26:47:9/Every living creature that swarms will live wherever the river flows. There will be a very large number of fish, because this water goes there and the waters of the sea become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.
26:47:10/Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish of the Great Sea, but in great abundance.
26:47:11/However, its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
26:47:12/Along the bank of the river, on both sides, will grow all kinds of trees used for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing."
26:47:13/This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "This will be the boundary by which you will divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph will have two portions.
26:47:14/You will inherit it equally, one as well as another, a land I swore to give to your ancestors. This land will become your inheritance.
26:47:15/This will be the boundary of the land on the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad;
26:47:16/Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer Hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26:47:17/The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the north side.
26:47:18/The eastern boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Eastern Sea and as far as Tamar. This will be the east side.
26:47:19/The south side will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea. This will be the south side.
26:47:20/The western boundary will be the Great Sea from the southern boundary straight up to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the west side.
26:47:21/You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
26:47:22/It will happen that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you who have children. They will be treated as native-born Israelites; along with you they will be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
26:47:23/In whatever tribe the foreigner resides, there you will give them their inheritance," declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:48:1/Here are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast along the route to Hethlon, heading towards Hamath, Hazarenan, the northern border of Damascus, up to the coast of Hamath; these are its boundaries east and west; a portion for Dan.
26:48:2/Next to Dan's territory, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Asher.
26:48:3/Next to Asher's territory, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Naphtali.
26:48:4/Next to Naphtali's territory, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Manasseh.
26:48:5/Next to Manasseh's territory, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Ephraim.
26:48:6/Next to Ephraim's territory, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Reuben.
26:48:7/Next to Reuben's territory, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Judah.
26:48:8/Next to Judah's territory, from the east side to the west side, will be the offering area, 25,000 reeds wide, and as long as the other portions from east to west; the sanctuary will be in the center.
26:48:9/The offering you shall present to the LORD will be 25,000 in length and 10,000 in width.
26:48:10/For the priests, there will be a sacred offering area; to the north 25,000 in length, to the west 10,000 in width, to the east 10,000 in width, and to the south 25,000 in length; and the LORD's sanctuary will be in the center.
26:48:11/This will be for the priests who are set apart, from the descendants of Zadok, who faithfully followed my instructions and did not stray when the Israelites strayed, unlike the Levites.
26:48:12/And the offered land will be a most holy area next to the territory of the Levites.
26:48:13/Opposite the priests' territory, the Levites will have an area 25,000 in length and 10,000 in width; the total length will be 25,000 and the width 10,000.
26:48:14/They must not sell, trade, or transfer the firstfruits of the land because it is sacred to the LORD.
26:48:15/The 5,000 that are left in width next to the 25,000 will be a common area for the city, for housing, and for suburbs; and the city will be in the center.
26:48:16/These will be its measurements; the north side 4,500, the south side 4,500, the east side 4,500, and the west side 4,500.
26:48:17/And the city's suburbs will extend 250 to the north, 250 to the south, 250 to the east, and 250 to the west.
26:48:18/The remaining area in length, adjacent to the sacred offering, will be 10,000 to the east and 10,000 to the west; it will be next to the sacred offering, and its produce will provide food for those who work in the city.
26:48:19/Those who work in the city will come from all the tribes of Israel.
26:48:20/The entire offering area will be 25,000 by 25,000; you shall offer the sacred square area along with the city property.
26:48:21/The remaining area will belong to the prince, on both sides of the sacred offering and the city property, adjacent to the 25,000 of the offering to the east border, and westward adjacent to the 25,000 towards the west border, alongside the portions for the prince; and the sacred offering and the sanctuary of the temple will be in the center.
26:48:22/Besides the land belonging to the Levites and the city property, located in the middle of what belongs to the prince, between the territory of Judah and Benjamin, will belong to the prince.
26:48:23/As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Benjamin will have a portion.
26:48:24/Next to Benjamin's territory, from the east side to the west side, Simeon will have a portion.
26:48:25/Next to Simeon's territory, from the east side to the west side, Issachar will have a portion.
26:48:26/Next to Issachar's territory, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun will have a portion.
26:48:27/Next to Zebulun's territory, from the east side to the west side, Gad will have a portion.
26:48:28/Next to Gad's territory, on the south side southward, the border will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, then along the river towards the Great Sea.
26:48:29/This is the land you shall allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions, declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:48:30/And these are the exits of the city on the north side, measuring 4,500.
26:48:31/The city gates will be named after the tribes of Israel: three gates to the north; one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, one gate for Levi.
26:48:32/And on the east side 4,500, with three gates; one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, one gate for Dan.
26:48:33/And on the south side 4,500 measures, with three gates; one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, one gate for Zebulun.
26:48:34/On the west side 4,500, with their three gates; one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, one gate for Naphtali.
26:48:35/It was around 18,000 measures in total: and from that day the name of the city will be, The LORD is There.
27:1:1/In the third year of Jehoiakim's reign as king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.
27:1:2/And the Lord handed Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, over to him, along with some of the sacred vessels from the house of God. These he took to the land of Shinar, to his god's temple, placing the vessels in the treasury of his god.
27:1:3/The king instructed Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility.
27:1:4/He wanted young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well-informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He planned to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.
27:1:5/The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and afterward, they were to enter the king's service.
27:1:6/Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
27:1:7/The chief of the eunuchs gave them new names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.
27:1:8/But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief of the eunuchs for permission not to defile himself this way.
27:1:9/And God caused Daniel to find favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs.
27:1:10/But the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you."
27:1:11/Then Daniel said to the guard whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
27:1:12/"Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27:1:13/Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see."
27:1:14/So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.
27:1:15/At the end of the ten days, they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.
27:1:16/So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.
27:1:17/To these four young men, God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
27:1:18/When the time came for them to be presented to the king, the chief of the eunuchs presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
27:1:19/The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they entered the king's service.
27:1:20/In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
27:1:21/And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
27:2:1/In the second year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he had dreams that troubled him so much that he couldn't sleep.
27:2:2/So the king ordered the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to be summoned to interpret his dreams. They came and stood before the king.
27:2:3/The king told them, "I had a dream that has disturbed me and I want to know what it means."
27:2:4/The Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, "O king, may you live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will explain its meaning."
27:2:5/The king replied to the Chaldeans, "I have forgotten the dream. If you don't tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be executed, and your houses will be turned into rubble."
27:2:6/"But if you reveal the dream and its interpretation, you will receive gifts, rewards, and great honor from me. So, tell me the dream and its interpretation."
27:2:7/They responded again, "Please, tell your servants the dream, and we will give you the interpretation."
27:2:8/The king answered, "I am certain you are trying to buy time, realizing that I have forgotten the dream."
27:2:9/"If you don't tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So, tell me the dream, and I will know you can interpret it for me."
27:2:10/The Chaldeans replied to the king, "No one on earth can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean."
27:2:11/"What the king requests is difficult, and no one can reveal it to the king except the gods, who do not live among humans."
27:2:12/This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.
27:2:13/So the decree was issued to kill the wise men, and men were sent to find and kill Daniel and his friends.
27:2:14/Daniel spoke with wisdom and tact to Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.
27:2:15/He asked Arioch, the king's commander, "Why is the king's decree so urgent?" Arioch then explained the situation to Daniel.
27:2:16/Daniel then went in and asked the king to give him time, promising to interpret the dream for him.
27:2:17/Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
27:2:18/He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
27:2:19/That night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Daniel praised the God of heaven.
27:2:20/Daniel said, "Praise be to the name of God forever and ever; wisdom and power are his."
27:2:21/"He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning."
27:2:22/"He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him."
27:2:23/"I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors, for giving me wisdom and power, and for revealing to us what we asked of you; for you have shown us the king's demand."
27:2:24/So Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."
27:2:25/Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king the interpretation."
27:2:26/The king asked Daniel, also known as Belteshazzar, "Can you tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?"
27:2:27/Daniel replied in the presence of the king, "The wise men, astrologers, magicians, and diviners cannot reveal to the king the mystery he has asked about."
27:2:28/"But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:"
27:2:29/"As for you, O king, thoughts came to your mind while on your bed about what would happen in the future, and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what is going to happen."
27:2:30/"As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind."
27:2:31/"You, O king, saw a great statue. This statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying."
27:2:32/"The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,"
27:2:33/"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay."
27:2:34/"As you watched, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them."
27:2:35/"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."
27:2:36/"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king."
27:2:37/"You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, power, strength, and glory,"
27:2:38/"and into whose hand he has given human beings, wherever they live, the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky, granting you authority over them all—you are the head of gold."
27:2:39/"After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours; then a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth."
27:2:40/"Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others."
27:2:41/"Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay."
27:2:42/"As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle."
27:2:43/"And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay."
27:2:44/"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever."
27:2:45/"This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy."
27:2:46/Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel, paid him honor, and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.
27:2:47/The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."
27:2:48/Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.
27:2:49/At Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to administer the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
27:3:1/King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue, sixty cubits tall and six cubits wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
27:3:2/Then King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the princes, governors, captains, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all provincial officials to attend the dedication of the statue he had erected.
27:3:3/So the princes, governors, captains, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.
27:3:4/Then a herald loudly proclaimed, "People of all nations and languages, listen up!
27:3:5/Whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
27:3:6/Anyone who does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."
27:3:7/Therefore, as soon as all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27:3:8/At that time, some Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.
27:3:9/They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "May the king live forever!
27:3:10/You, O king, have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the gold statue,
27:3:11/and that anyone who does not fall down and worship should be thrown into a blazing furnace.
27:3:12/There are some Jews you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who have ignored your command, O king. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up."
27:3:13/In a furious rage, Nebuchadnezzar ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be brought before him. So they were brought before the king.
27:3:14/Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold statue I have set up?
27:3:15/Now, if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the statue I made, good. But if you do not worship, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. And who is the god who will rescue you from my hands?"
27:3:16/Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
27:3:17/If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and He will rescue us from your hand, O king.
27:3:18/But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up."
27:3:19/Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual.
27:3:20/And he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.
27:3:21/So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
27:3:22/The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
27:3:23/and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.
27:3:24/Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, O king."
27:3:25/He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."
27:3:26/Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire,
27:3:27/and the princes, governors, captains, and the king's advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.
27:3:28/Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His angel and rescued His servants! They trusted in Him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
27:3:29/Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way."
27:3:30/Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
27:4:1/Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all peoples, nations, and languages living across the earth; may peace be greatly increased for you.
27:4:2/I thought it was important to share the miraculous signs and wonders that the high God has performed for me.
27:4:3/How incredible are his signs! And how powerful are his wonders! His kingdom lasts forever, and his rule extends from one generation to the next.
27:4:4/I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at peace in my home, thriving in my palace.
27:4:5/I had a dream that frightened me, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions in my mind disturbed me.
27:4:6/So, I issued a decree to summon all the wise men of Babylon to me, so they could explain the dream's meaning.
27:4:7/The magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and diviners came, but they couldn't explain the dream to me.
27:4:8/Finally, Daniel came before me, who is named Belteshazzar after my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I shared the dream with him, saying,
27:4:9/"O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell me what my dream means and its interpretation."
27:4:10/In my dream, I saw a tree at the center of the earth, towering high.
27:4:11/The tree grew strong, its top touching the sky, visible to the ends of the earth.
27:4:12/Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, providing food for all. Wild animals found shade under it, birds lived in its branches, and every creature was fed from it.
27:4:13/In my dream, I saw a sentinel, a holy one, coming down from heaven.
27:4:14/He shouted, 'Cut down the tree, trim off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from beneath it and the birds from its branches.
27:4:15/However, leave the stump with its roots in the ground, bound with iron and bronze, surrounded by tender grass. Let it be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let it share the lot of the animals in the grass of the earth.
27:4:16/Let its human heart be replaced with the heart of an animal, and let this condition prevail for seven periods of time.
27:4:17/This decree is issued by the sentinels, and the sentence by the word of the holy ones, so that all living may know that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of men and gives them to whomever he wishes, setting over them the lowliest of people.'
27:4:18/This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me its interpretation, since none of the wise men in my kingdom can explain it to me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
27:4:19/Then Daniel, also known as Belteshazzar, was stunned for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, 'Belteshazzar, don't let the dream or its interpretation worry you.' Belteshazzar replied, 'My lord, may the dream apply to those who oppose you, and its interpretation to your adversaries.'
27:4:20/The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, reaching to the sky and visible to the whole earth,
27:4:21/with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, under which wild animals lived, and in whose branches birds made their nests,
27:4:22/it represents you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.
27:4:23/And as for the king seeing a sentinel, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; let it be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share the lot of the animals of the field until seven periods of time pass over him,'
27:4:24/this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king:
27:4:25/You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like oxen and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven periods of time will pass over you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.
27:4:26/And as for the command to leave the stump of the tree roots, your kingdom will be restored to you once you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
27:4:27/Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you: renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.'
27:4:28/All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27:4:29/After twelve months, he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon.
27:4:30/The king exclaimed, 'Is this not the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?'
27:4:31/While the words were still in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven, 'O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has been taken from you.
27:4:32/You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like oxen, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.'
27:4:33/Immediately, the sentence was carried out on Nebuchadnezzar: he was driven from people, ate grass like oxen, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
27:4:34/At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes to heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.
27:4:35/All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him, 'What have you done?'
27:4:36/At the same time, my sanity was restored, along with the glory of my kingdom, my honor and splendor returned to me. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.
27:4:37/Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because all his acts are true and his ways just. And he can humble those who walk in pride.
27:5:1/Belshazzar the king threw a massive party for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine in front of them all.
27:5:2/While enjoying the wine, Belshazzar ordered to bring the gold and silver vessels that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem; so that he, his princes, his wives, and his concubines could drink from them.
27:5:3/So they brought the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem; and the king, his princes, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
27:5:4/They drank wine and praised the gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27:5:5/At that very moment, fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, near the lampstand. The king saw the hand as it wrote.
27:5:6/The king's face turned pale, and his thoughts terrified him. His hips gave way, and his knees knocked together.
27:5:7/The king shouted to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners. He said to the wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and tells me its meaning will be dressed in purple, have a gold chain placed around his neck, and be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
27:5:8/All the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.
27:5:9/King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face grew more pale, and his lords were baffled.
27:5:10/The queen, because of what the king and his lords had said, came into the banquet hall. "O king, live forever!" she said. "Don't let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale.
27:5:11/There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father, he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar, your father—your father the king, I say—appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners.
27:5:12/This man, Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means."
27:5:13/So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?
27:5:14/I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.
27:5:15/The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me its meaning, but they could not explain it.
27:5:16/But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read the writing and tell me its meaning, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain placed around your neck, and be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
27:5:17/Then Daniel replied to the king, "Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.
27:5:18/"Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness, glory and honor.
27:5:19/And because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations of every language dreaded and feared him. Those he wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled.
27:5:20/But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.
27:5:21/He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes.
27:5:22/"But you, his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.
27:5:23/Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.
27:5:24/Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
27:5:25/"This is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
27:5:26/"This is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
27:5:27/Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found lacking.
27:5:28/Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."
27:5:29/At Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
27:5:30/That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was killed.
27:5:31/And Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.
27:6:1/Darius decided to appoint 120 princes to govern the entire kingdom;
27:6:2/And above these, three presidents, with Daniel being the foremost, so the princes would report to them, ensuring the king suffered no loss.
27:6:3/Daniel was favored above the presidents and princes because he possessed an exceptional spirit, and the king planned to place him in charge of the entire kingdom.
27:6:4/However, the presidents and princes tried to find reasons to accuse Daniel in matters of state, but they could not find any fault or error in him because he was trustworthy.
27:6:5/These men concluded, "We will not find any grounds for accusation against Daniel unless it has to do with the law of his God."
27:6:6/So these presidents and princes went as a group to the king and said, "King Darius, may you live forever.
27:6:7/All the kingdom's presidents, governors, princes, advisors, and commanders have agreed to establish a royal law and enforce a strict decree that anyone who petitions any god or man except you, O king, for thirty days, shall be thrown into the lions' den.
27:6:8/Now, O king, issue this decree and sign the document so that it cannot be altered, in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which are irrevocable."
27:6:9/Therefore, King Darius signed the document and decree.
27:6:10/When Daniel learned that the decree had been signed, he went home. With his windows open towards Jerusalem, he knelt down to pray and give thanks to his God three times a day, just as he had always done.
27:6:11/Then these men found Daniel praying and pleading before his God.
27:6:12/They approached the king and questioned him about his decree, "Did you not sign a decree that anyone who petitions any god or man within thirty days, except you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?" The king confirmed, "The decree stands, in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."
27:6:13/They then said to the king, "Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you signed, but prays three times a day."
27:6:14/Upon hearing this, the king was greatly distressed and was determined to save Daniel, working until sunset to find a way to rescue him.
27:6:15/But these men insisted to the king, "Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians, no decree or statute the king establishes can be changed."
27:6:16/So the king ordered Daniel to be brought and thrown into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve so faithfully, rescue you."
27:6:17/A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own seal and the seals of his lords, so that Daniel's situation might not be altered.
27:6:18/Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting; no entertainment was provided for him, and he could not sleep.
27:6:19/At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.
27:6:20/As he approached the den, he called out to Daniel in anguish, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve so faithfully, been able to rescue you from the lions?"
27:6:21/Daniel replied to the king, "May the king live forever.
27:6:22/My God sent his angel to shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found innocent in his sight. And also before you, O king, I have done no wrong."
27:6:23/The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den. When Daniel was brought up out of the den, no injury was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
27:6:24/The king then commanded that those men who had falsely accused Daniel be thrown into the lions' den, along with their families. Before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones.
27:6:25/Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: "May you have abundant peace.
27:6:26/I decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. For he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, and his dominion will never end.
27:6:27/He rescues and saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions."
27:6:28/Thus, Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27:7:1/In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions while sleeping: then he wrote the dream down, and summarized the events.
27:7:2/Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision at night, and, look, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
27:7:3/And four huge beasts emerged from the sea, each different from the others.
27:7:4/The first was like a lion, but had eagle’s wings: I watched until its wings were torn off, and it was lifted from the ground, made to stand on two feet like a human, and given a human heart.
27:7:5/And then another beast appeared, a second one, resembling a bear. It propped itself up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and they said to it, 'Get up, consume a lot of flesh.'
27:7:6/After this, I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had four bird wings on its back; the beast also had four heads; and power was given to it.
27:7:7/After this, in my night visions, I saw a fourth beast, terrifying and frightening, and extremely strong; it had huge iron teeth: it devoured and crushed, and trampled what was left with its feet: it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.
27:7:8/I focused on the horns, and, look, another small horn sprouted among them, before which three of the first horns were uprooted: and, look, in this horn were eyes like human eyes, and a mouth speaking boastful words.
27:7:9/I watched until thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat, His clothing was as white as snow, and the hair of His head like the purest wool: His throne was like flames of fire, and its wheels were ablaze.
27:7:10/A river of fire was flowing and coming out from before Him: thousands upon thousands served Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the court was convened, and the books were opened.
27:7:11/I watched then because of the boastful words the horn was speaking: I watched until the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.
27:7:12/Regarding the rest of the beasts, their power was taken away, but their lives were extended for a period of time.
27:7:13/In my night visions, I saw someone like a human being coming with the clouds of heaven, approaching the Ancient of Days, who was presented before Him.
27:7:14/He was given authority, honor, and a kingdom, so that people of all nations and languages would serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
27:7:15/I, Daniel, was distressed in my spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind alarmed me.
27:7:16/I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he explained it to me and revealed the interpretation of these events:
27:7:17/These great beasts, which are four in number, represent four kings who will rise from the earth.
27:7:18/But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for eternity.
27:7:19/Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, extremely terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that devoured, crushed, and trampled its victims underfoot;
27:7:20/And about the ten horns on its head, and the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully and looked more imposing than the others.
27:7:21/I watched as that horn waged war against the holy people and defeated them,
27:7:22/Until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.
27:7:23/He explained, "The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be different from all other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it.
27:7:24/The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them, another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.
27:7:25/He will speak against the Most High and oppress His holy people, intending to change the set times and laws. They will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a time.
27:7:26/But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away, to be completely destroyed forever.
27:7:27/Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey Him."
27:7:28/This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.
27:8:1/In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, following the first one that had come to me.
27:8:2/In this vision, I found myself in Shushan, the palace, located in the province of Elam; I was beside the Ulai River.
27:8:3/When I looked up, I saw a ram standing by the river with two horns; both horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one grew out last.
27:8:4/The ram charged westward, northward, and southward, overpowering all animals in its path so that none could stand against it or escape from its power; it did as it pleased and became very powerful.
27:8:5/While I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a conspicuous horn between its eyes came from the west, covering the ground without touching it.
27:8:6/This goat charged the two-horned ram I had seen standing by the river, attacking it with furious power.
27:8:7/I saw the goat approach the ram in a rage, strike the ram, break its two horns, and the ram had no strength to stand against it. The goat knocked the ram to the ground and trampled on it, and no one could rescue the ram from its power.
27:8:8/As a result, the goat grew extremely powerful; but at the height of its power, the large horn was broken off, and in its place, four prominent horns grew toward the four winds of heaven.
27:8:9/From one of these horns, a small one emerged and grew exceedingly great toward the south, the east, and the beautiful land.
27:8:10/It grew so great it reached the host of heaven, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.
27:8:11/It even challenged the commander of the host; it removed the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
27:8:12/Because of rebellion, a host was given over to the horn along with the daily sacrifice, and it threw truth to the ground; it did all this and prospered.
27:8:13/Then I heard one holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, "How long will the vision about the daily sacrifice and the devastating rebellion last, allowing the sanctuary and the host to be trampled?"
27:8:14/He replied, "For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be restored."
27:8:15/After I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was trying to understand it, suddenly I saw someone who looked like a man standing before me.
27:8:16/I heard a human voice from the Ulai calling out, "Gabriel, explain the vision to this man."
27:8:17/So he came near where I stood, and when he approached, I was terrified and fell prostrate. But he said to me, "Understand, son of man, that the vision is about the time of the end."
27:8:18/While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me, lifting me to my feet.
27:8:19/He said, "I am going to tell you what will happen in the final period of wrath, for it concerns the appointed time of the end."
27:8:20/The ram you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
27:8:21/The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.
27:8:22/After it is broken, four kingdoms will arise from the nation, but they will not have the same power.
27:8:23/In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce king, skilled in intrigue, will arise.
27:8:24/His power will be great, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the powerful, along with the holy people.
27:8:25/He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.
27:8:26/The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given to you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.
27:8:27/And I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
27:9:1/In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, from the Medes' lineage, who became king over the Chaldeans;
27:9:2/In his first year as king, I, Daniel, learned from the scriptures the number of years that the LORD had told Jeremiah the prophet it would take to complete the seventy years of Jerusalem's desolation.
27:9:3/So I turned my attention to the Lord God, seeking him through prayer and pleas for mercy, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
27:9:4/And I prayed to the LORD my God, confessing my sins, and said, "O Lord, the great and awe-inspiring God, who keeps his covenant and shows mercy to those who love him and keep his commandments;
27:9:5/We have sinned, acted unjustly, behaved wickedly, and rebelled, turning away from your commands and laws.
27:9:6/We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our leaders, our ancestors, and all the people of the land.
27:9:7/O LORD, righteousness belongs to you, but to us, shame is evident today—to the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered them because of their unfaithfulness to you.
27:9:8/O Lord, shame faces us, our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, because we have sinned against you.
27:9:9/To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, even though we have rebelled against him;
27:9:10/We have not obeyed the LORD our God or followed the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
27:9:11/Indeed, all Israel has violated your law and turned away, refusing to listen to your voice; so the curse and oath written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us because we have sinned against you.
27:9:12/He has fulfilled his words, which he spoke against us and our rulers by bringing upon us a great disaster. Under the entire heaven, nothing has been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
27:9:13/As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and giving attention to your truth.
27:9:14/Therefore, the LORD has kept the disaster in mind and brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all he does; yet we have not obeyed his voice.
27:9:15/And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong.
27:9:16/O LORD, in keeping with all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.
27:9:17/Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.
27:9:18/Give ear, my God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.
27:9:19/O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention and act! Do not delay for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people bear your name."
27:9:20/While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and laying my plea before the LORD my God for his holy hill—
27:9:21/Yes, while I was praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
27:9:22/He instructed me and said, "Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.
27:9:23/As soon as you began to pray, a command was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the message and understand the vision:
27:9:24/Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.
27:9:25/Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.
27:9:26/After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.
27:9:27/He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.' In the middle of the 'seven' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple, he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on the desolator.
27:10:1/In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar. The revelation was true and concerned a great conflict. Daniel understood the message and what the vision meant.
27:10:2/During that time, I, Daniel, was in mourning for three full weeks.
27:10:3/I didn't eat any tasty food, nor did I consume meat or wine, nor did I use any oils, until the three weeks were completely over.
27:10:4/On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, the Tigris,
27:10:5/I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
27:10:6/His body was like topaz, his face shone like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and legs gleamed like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like a multitude.
27:10:7/Only I, Daniel, saw the vision. The men with me didn't see it, but a great terror fell on them, and they ran away to hide.
27:10:8/So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision. I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale, and I was powerless.
27:10:9/Yet I heard the sound of his words. As I listened, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.
27:10:10/Then a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
27:10:11/He said to me, "Daniel, you are highly esteemed. Understand the words I am speaking to you, and stand up, for I have been sent to you." When he said this to me, I stood up, but I was still trembling.
27:10:12/Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.
27:10:13/However, the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.
27:10:14/Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come."
27:10:15/When he said this to me, I bowed my face toward the ground and was speechless.
27:10:16/Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, "My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish, and I have no strength.
27:10:17/How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone, and I can hardly breathe."
27:10:18/Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.
27:10:19/He said, "Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed. Peace be with you; be strong, now be strong." When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength."
27:10:20/Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come.
27:10:21/But first, I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince.
27:11:1/Also I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood by to support and strengthen him.
27:11:2/And now, I will show you the truth. Look, there will rise three more kings in Persia; and the fourth will be far wealthier than all of them: and with his wealth, he will provoke everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
27:11:3/A powerful king will rise, who will rule with vast dominion and do as he pleases.
27:11:4/But when he rises, his kingdom will be shattered and divided towards the four winds of heaven; not to his descendants, nor according to the power he wielded, because his kingdom will be uprooted for others, not his own.
27:11:5/The king of the south will become strong, along with one of his leaders; he will be stronger than the other and have dominion; his dominion will be a vast one.
27:11:6/After some years, they will form an alliance; the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she will not retain her power, nor will he endure, nor his power: but she will be handed over, along with those who brought her, her father, and he who supported her in those times.
27:11:7/However, from her family line, someone will arise in his place, who will come with an army, enter the fortress of the king of the north, confront them, and triumph.
27:11:8/He will also take their gods, their princes, and their valuable silver and gold items as captives to Egypt; and he will rule longer than the king of the north.
27:11:9/So the king of the south will enter his kingdom and then return to his own land.
27:11:10/But his sons will be provoked and gather a large army: one will certainly come, overflow, and pass through; then he will return, and be provoked, even to his fortress.
27:11:11/The king of the south, enraged, will march out and fight with the king of the north, who will raise a large army, but that army will be handed over to his enemy.
27:11:12/After capturing the army, his confidence will swell; he will overthrow tens of thousands, but he will not prevail.
27:11:13/The king of the north will return with a larger army than before, and after some years, he will come with a great army and abundant resources.
27:11:14/In those times, many will rise against the king of the south. The violent among your own people will also rise to fulfill the vision, but they will fail.
27:11:15/Then the king of the north will come, build siege ramps, and capture a fortified city. The forces of the south will not stand, nor will their elite troops; there will be no strength to resist.
27:11:16/But the one who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him. He will stand in the beautiful land, with destruction in his hand.
27:11:17/He will set his sights on conquering the entire kingdom with the help of a select few; this is what he will accomplish. He will offer the daughter of women to corrupt her, but she will not stand with him or be for him.
27:11:18/Afterwards, he will turn his attention to the coastal lands and capture many, but a commander will put an end to his insult against him; instead, he will turn the insult back on him.
27:11:19/Then he will turn back towards the fortresses of his own country, but he will stumble, fall, and be seen no more.
27:11:20/His successor will send an oppressor through the jewel of his kingdom, but within a few days, he will be broken, though not in anger or in battle.
27:11:21/In his place, a contemptible person will arise, someone not given the honor of royalty. He will come in a time of peace and seize the kingdom through smooth talk.
27:11:22/Overwhelming forces will be swept away before him and broken, including the leader of the covenant.
27:11:23/After making an alliance, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few supporters, he will become powerful.
27:11:24/Without warning, he will enter the richest areas of the land and do what his fathers and forefathers never did, distributing plunder, loot, and wealth among them. He will plot the downfall of fortresses—but only for a time.
27:11:25/He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the south with a large army; the king of the south will wage war with a very large and powerful army, but he will not stand because of plots devised against him.
27:11:26/Those who eat from the king's provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle.
27:11:27/The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time.
27:11:28/He will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action and then return to his own country.
27:11:29/At the appointed time, he will invade the south again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before.
27:11:30/Ships from the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
27:11:31/His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination that causes desolation.
27:11:32/He will corrupt those who violate the covenant with smooth words, but the people who know their God will stand firm and take action.
27:11:33/Those with insight among the people will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by sword or flame, or be captured or plundered.
27:11:34/When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them.
27:11:35/Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified, and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.
27:11:36/The king will do as he pleases, exalting and magnifying himself above every god, and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place.
27:11:37/He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.
27:11:38/Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
27:11:39/He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing land as a reward.
27:11:40/At the time of the end, the king of the south will engage him in battle, and the king of the north will storm out against him with chariots, cavalry, and a great fleet of ships. He will invade countries, sweeping through them like a flood.
27:11:41/He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand.
27:11:42/He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape.
27:11:43/He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission.
27:11:44/But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many.
27:11:45/He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
27:12:1/At that time, Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a period of distress unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time, your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be rescued.
27:12:2/Many of those who lie in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and others to shame and eternal disgrace.
27:12:3/Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever.
27:12:4/But you, Daniel, keep these words secret and seal the book until the end of time. Many will search eagerly, and knowledge will increase.
27:12:5/Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on each side of the riverbank.
27:12:6/One of them asked the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long until the end of these astonishing events?"
27:12:7/And I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he raised his right and left hands toward heaven and swore by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.
27:12:8/I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?"
27:12:9/He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end.
27:12:10/Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.
27:12:11/From the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.
27:12:12/Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
27:12:13/But as for you, go your way until the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.
28:1:1/The message from the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
28:1:2/The LORD's message began with Hosea. And the LORD told Hosea, "Go, marry a woman who has been unfaithful, and have children with her who are born of unfaithfulness: for the land has been utterly unfaithful, turning away from the LORD."
28:1:3/So he went and married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim; she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for him.
28:1:4/And the LORD said to him, "Name him Jezreel; because soon, I will punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will end the kingdom of the house of Israel."
28:1:5/"And when that day comes, I will break Israel's military power in the Jezreel Valley."
28:1:6/Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. And God told him, "Name her Lo-ruhamah: for I will no longer show mercy to the house of Israel; I will utterly take them away."
28:1:7/But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, and I will save them by the LORD their God, and not by military might, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."
28:1:8/After she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
28:1:9/Then God said, "Name him Lo-ammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God."
28:1:10/"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted; and in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' it will be said to them, 'You are the children of the living God.'"
28:1:11/"Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be reunited, and they will choose one leader, and they will rise from the land: for great will be the day of Jezreel."
28:2:1/Tell your brothers, 'You are my people,' and to your sisters, 'You have received mercy.'
28:2:2/Argue with your mother, argue: for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove her unfaithfulness from her sight, and her adultery from her chest;
28:2:3/Otherwise, I will strip her bare and leave her as on the day she was born, turn her into a desert, make her like parched land, and let her die of thirst.
28:2:4/And I will show no mercy to her children because they are children of unfaithfulness.
28:2:5/For their mother has been unfaithful; she who conceived them has acted shamefully. She said, 'I will chase after my lovers, who provide me with my food and water, my wool and linen, my oil, and my drink.'
28:2:6/So, look, I will block her path with thorns and build a wall so that she cannot find her way.
28:2:7/She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my first husband, for I was better off then than now.'
28:2:8/She did not realize that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and oil, who lavished on her silver and gold—which they used for Baal.
28:2:9/Therefore, I will take back my grain in its time and my wine in its season, and I will take back my wool and my linen intended to cover her nakedness.
28:2:10/Now I will expose her lewdness in the eyes of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from my hands.
28:2:11/I will also put an end to all her joy, her festivals, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts.
28:2:12/I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.
28:2:13/I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals, when she put on her rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, forgetting me," declares the LORD.
28:2:14/Therefore, I will woo her, lead her into the desert, and speak tenderly to her.
28:2:15/From there, I will give her back her vineyards, and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she will respond as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up from the land of Egypt.
28:2:16/In that day," declares the LORD, "you will call me 'my husband'; you will no longer call me 'my master.'
28:2:17/For I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; their names will no longer be invoked.
28:2:18/In that day, I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the creatures that move along the ground. I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and will make them lie down in safety.
28:2:19/I will engage you to me forever; I will engage you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.
28:2:20/I will engage you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD.
28:2:21/In that day, I will respond," declares the LORD. "I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;
28:2:22/And the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the oil; and they will respond to Jezreel.
28:2:23/I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called 'Not my loved one.' I will say to those called 'Not my people,' 'You are my people'; and they will say, 'You are my God.'
28:3:1/Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by a friend but is an adulteress, just as the LORD loves the children of Israel, who turn to other gods and love flagons of wine.
28:3:2/So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer and a half of barley.
28:3:3/And I told her, "You must wait for me for many days; you must not be promiscuous, and you must not be with another man: and I will do the same for you."
28:3:4/For the children of Israel will live for many days without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, without an idol, without a priestly garment, and without household gods.
28:3:5/Afterward, the children of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the days to come.
28:4:1/Listen to the word of the LORD, you children of Israel: for the LORD has a dispute with the people of the land, because there is no truth, no mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
28:4:2/Through swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and committing adultery, they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
28:4:3/Therefore, the land will mourn, and everyone living in it will waste away, along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky; even the fish of the sea will be taken away.
28:4:4/But let no one argue or accuse another, for your people are like those who argue with the priest.
28:4:5/So you will stumble by day, and the prophet will stumble with you by night; and I will destroy your mother.
28:4:6/My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.
28:4:7/The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will change their honor into disgrace.
28:4:8/They feed on the sins of my people and are greedy for their iniquity.
28:4:9/It will be like people, like priest. I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
28:4:10/They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have stopped paying attention to the LORD.
28:4:11/Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away the understanding.
28:4:12/My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner's rod speaks to them. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.
28:4:13/They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore, your daughters turn to prostitution and your brides to adultery.
28:4:14/I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes—a people without understanding will come to ruin.
28:4:15/Though you, Israel, play the whore, let not Judah become guilty. Do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to Bethaven, and do not swear, 'As the LORD lives.'
28:4:16/For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer. Can the LORD now feed them like a lamb in a spacious pasture?
28:4:17/Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone.
28:4:18/Their drink has gone sour; they continually engage in prostitution. Her rulers dearly love shameful ways.
28:4:19/A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.
28:5:1/Listen up, priests; pay attention, people of Israel; and listen closely, royal house; because judgment is coming for you, since you've been a trap at Mizpah and a net spread on Tabor.
28:5:2/Those who rebel are experts at causing destruction, even though I have rebuked them all.
28:5:3/I am fully aware of Ephraim, and Israel cannot hide from me: for now, Ephraim, you engage in unfaithfulness, and Israel is polluted.
28:5:4/They refuse to change their ways to return to their God: for a spirit of unfaithfulness is among them, and they do not know the LORD.
28:5:5/Israel's arrogance is evident for all to see: therefore, both Israel and Ephraim will fall because of their sins; Judah will fall with them.
28:5:6/They will take their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, but they won't find him; he has withdrawn from them.
28:5:7/They have been unfaithful to the LORD: they have produced offspring that are foreign to him: now a month will consume them along with their possessions.
28:5:8/Sound the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: raise your voice at Bethaven, follow you, Benjamin.
28:5:9/Ephraim will be left desolate when I rebuke them: among the tribes of Israel, I have declared what will surely happen.
28:5:10/The leaders of Judah have crossed the line: therefore, I will unleash my fury on them like a flood.
28:5:11/Ephraim is crushed and judged harshly, because he willingly followed false commands.
28:5:12/So, I will be to Ephraim like a moth, and to the house of Judah like decay.
28:5:13/When Ephraim realized his illness, and Judah saw his injury, then Ephraim turned to the Assyrian, and sent to King Jareb: but he couldn't heal you or mend your wounds.
28:5:14/For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and to the house of Judah like a young lion: I, even I, will tear them apart and leave; I will carry them off, and no one will rescue them.
28:5:15/I will leave and return to my place, until they admit their guilt and seek my presence: in their distress, they will earnestly search for me.
28:6:1/Come, let's return to the LORD. He has wounded us, but he will heal us; he has struck us, but he will bind our wounds.
28:6:2/In two days he will revive us; on the third day, he will restore us, so we may live in his presence.
28:6:3/Then we will truly know the LORD if we strive to know him. His arrival is as certain as the dawn; he will come to us like the rain, like the spring rains that water the earth.
28:6:4/O Ephraim, what should I do with you? O Judah, how should I deal with you? Your loyalty is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.
28:6:5/That's why I have cut you down through the prophets; I have killed you with the words of my mouth; my judgments shine forth like the light.
28:6:6/I desire steadfast love, not sacrifice; the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
28:6:7/But like humans, they have broken the covenant; there they have betrayed me.
28:6:8/Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, stained with the blood of innocence.
28:6:9/Just as bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together to murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful acts.
28:6:10/I have seen a shocking thing in the house of Israel: Ephraim's promiscuity is there, Israel is defiled.
28:6:11/Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you, when I restore the fortunes of my people.
28:7:1/When I wanted to heal Israel, then the sin of Ephraim was exposed, along with the evil deeds of Samaria: for they engage in deception; and the thief enters, and a band of robbers plunders openly.
28:7:2/And they do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their evil deeds: now their own actions have surrounded them; they are in my full view.
28:7:3/They please the king with their wickedness, and the princes with their falsehoods.
28:7:4/They are all unfaithful, like an oven heated by the baker, who stops stirring after he has mixed the dough, until it rises.
28:7:5/On the day of our king, the princes have made him ill with bottles of wine; he has joined hands with mockers.
28:7:6/For they prepare their heart like an oven, while they lay in wait: their baker sleeps all night; in the morning it burns like a blazing fire.
28:7:7/They are all as hot as an oven, and have consumed their judges; all their kings have fallen: none among them calls out to me.
28:7:8/Ephraim has mixed himself among the nations; Ephraim is an unturned cake.
28:7:9/Foreigners have drained his strength, and he doesn't realize it: indeed, gray hairs are sprinkled on him, yet he is unaware.
28:7:10/And the arrogance of Israel testifies against him: yet they do not turn back to the LORD their God, nor seek him despite all this.
28:7:11/Ephraim is like a senseless dove, lacking understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
28:7:12/When they go, I will spread my net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the sky; I will discipline them, as their assembly has been warned.
28:7:13/Woe to them! for they have strayed from me: destruction to them! because they have sinned against me: although I have redeemed them, they have still lied about me.
28:7:14/And they have not cried out to me sincerely, when they wailed on their beds: they gather together for grain and wine, and they rebel against me.
28:7:15/Even though I have strengthened their arms, they still plot evil against me.
28:7:16/They turn back, but not to the Most High: they are like a faulty bow: their princes will fall by the sword because of the fury of their speech: this will be their mockery in the land of Egypt.
28:8:1/Sound the alarm. An eagle swoops down on the house of the LORD because they've broken my covenant and violated my laws.
28:8:2/Israel will cry out to me, "My God, we acknowledge you."
28:8:3/Israel has rejected what is good; now the enemy will chase them.
28:8:4/They've appointed kings without my consent; they've established leaders I didn't recognize. With their silver and gold, they've crafted idols, only to bring about their own destruction.
28:8:5/Your calf idol, O Samaria, has brought you down; my anger burns against them. How long until they seek purity?
28:8:6/It came from Israel: a craftsman made it, so it's not God. The calf of Samaria will be shattered.
28:8:7/They've planted the wind and will harvest the storm. It won't produce grain; if it does, foreigners will consume it.
28:8:8/Israel is consumed; now they are among the nations like a worthless vessel.
28:8:9/They've turned to Assyria, like a lone wild donkey. Ephraim has courted allies.
28:8:10/Even though they've sought alliances among the nations, I will now gather them, and they will grieve briefly over the burden of the king of princes.
28:8:11/Because Ephraim has built many altars for sinning, these altars will become his downfall.
28:8:12/I've written them profound teachings from my law, but they've treated them as alien.
28:8:13/They offer sacrifices, my offerings, and eat the meat, but the LORD does not accept them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins: they will return to Egypt.
28:8:14/Israel has forgotten his Creator and built temples; Judah has fortified many cities. But I will send fire upon his cities, and it will consume their fortresses.
28:9:1/Don't celebrate, Israel, like other nations might; for you have betrayed your God, you have chased after rewards on every threshing floor.
28:9:2/The threshing floor and the winepress won't sustain them, and the new wine will fail.
28:9:3/They won't live in the Lord's land; instead, Ephraim will go back to Egypt, and they will eat impure food in Assyria.
28:9:4/They won't present wine offerings to the Lord, nor will they please him: their sacrifices will be like mourning bread; everyone who eats it will be defiled. For their bread for their soul won't enter the house of the Lord.
28:9:5/What will you do on the solemn day, and on the day of the Lord's festival?
28:9:6/Indeed, they are gone due to destruction: Egypt will collect them, Memphis will bury them: nettles will take over their precious places for silver, thorns will invade their tents.
28:9:7/The days of punishment have arrived, the days of retribution are here; Israel will realize it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is insane, because of your great sin and immense hatred.
28:9:8/The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a trap of a bird catcher in all his paths, and hostility in the house of his God.
28:9:9/They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their sin, he will punish their sins.
28:9:10/I discovered Israel like grapes in the desert; I saw your ancestors as the first fruits on the fig tree at its first season: but they went to Baalpeor, and dedicated themselves to that disgrace; and their shameful acts were as they loved.
28:9:11/As for Ephraim, their glory shall vanish like a bird, from birth, and from pregnancy, and from conception.
28:9:12/Even if they raise their children, I will make them childless, until no one is left: indeed, woe to them when I turn away from them!
28:9:13/Ephraim, as I saw Tyre, is planted in a delightful spot: but Ephraim will lead his children out to the killer.
28:9:14/Give them, O Lord: what will you give? Give them a womb that miscarries and dry breasts.
28:9:15/All their evil is in Gilgal: for there I began to hate them: because of the wickedness of their actions I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their leaders are rebels.
28:9:16/Ephraim is struck down, their root is dried up, they will bear no fruit: even if they give birth, I will kill the beloved offspring of their womb.
28:9:17/My God will reject them, because they did not listen to him: and they will be wanderers among the nations.
28:10:1/Israel is like a barren vine, producing fruit only for itself: with the abundance of its fruit, it has multiplied its altars; with the richness of its land, they have crafted impressive idols.
28:10:2/Their heart is divided; now they will be found guilty: he will demolish their altars, he will destroy their idols.
28:10:3/For now they will say, "We have no king, because we did not fear the LORD; what could a king do for us anyway?"
28:10:4/They have spoken lies, swearing falsely while making agreements: thus, justice emerges as poison in the plowed fields.
28:10:5/The people of Samaria will be terrified because of the golden calves of Bethaven: its people will grieve for it, and its priests who celebrated it will mourn, for its glory has vanished.
28:10:6/It will also be taken to Assyria as a gift to King Jareb: Ephraim will be humiliated, and Israel will regret its own advice.
28:10:7/As for Samaria, its king will disappear like foam on the water.
28:10:8/The high places of Aven, Israel's sin, will be destroyed: thorns and thistles will grow over their altars; and they will beg the mountains, "Cover us," and to the hills, "Fall on us."
28:10:9/O Israel, you have been sinning since the days of Gibeah: there they stood firm: the battle in Gibeah against the forces of evil did not defeat them.
28:10:10/I desire to discipline them; and the people will be rallied against them, when they bind themselves in their wrongdoing.
28:10:11/And Ephraim is like a trained heifer that loves to thresh grain; but I will come over her beautiful neck: I will put Ephraim to work; Judah will plow, and Jacob will break the ground.
28:10:12/Plant seeds of righteousness, harvest in kindness; break up your unplowed ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers righteousness on you.
28:10:13/You have plowed wickedness, you have harvested injustice; you have eaten the fruit of deception: because you trusted in your own path, in the strength of your warriors.
28:10:14/Therefore, an uproar will break out among your people, and all your fortresses will be looted, as Shalman destroyed Betharbel on the day of battle: the mother was shattered along with her children.
28:10:15/So will Bethel do to you because of your immense wickedness: by morning, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
28:11:1/When Israel was young, I loved him and called my son out of Egypt.
28:11:2/But the more they were called, the more they turned away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning incense to idols.
28:11:3/I taught Ephraim to walk, holding them by their arms; but they did not realize I healed them.
28:11:4/I led them with gentle ties, with ropes of love; and I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.
28:11:5/He will not return to Egypt, but Assyria will be his king because they refused to turn back.
28:11:6/And the sword will remain in his cities, destroying his branches and consuming them, because of their own schemes.
28:11:7/My people are determined to turn away from me. Even though they call to the Most High, none at all exalt him.
28:11:8/How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.
28:11:9/I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I devastate Ephraim again. For I am God, not a human—the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath.
28:11:10/They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.
28:11:11/They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from the land of Assyria. And I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.
28:11:12/Ephraim surrounds me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah still rules with God and is faithful with the holy ones.
28:12:1/Ephraim chases after the wind and follows the east wind: he constantly adds to his lies and destruction; and they form alliances with the Assyrians, and oil is transported to Egypt.
28:12:2/The LORD also has a dispute with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his actions; he will repay him based on what he has done.
28:12:3/He grabbed his brother's heel in the womb, and with his strength, he struggled with God.
28:12:4/Indeed, he struggled with the angel and overcame: he cried and pleaded with him: he met him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us.
28:12:5/Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his name to remember.
28:12:6/So, turn back to your God: maintain kindness and justice, and always hope in your God.
28:12:7/He is a trader, using dishonest scales; he loves to exploit.
28:12:8/And Ephraim says, "Yet I have become wealthy, I have gained wealth for myself: in all my efforts, they will find no fault in me that is sin."
28:12:9/And I, the LORD your God since the time of Egypt, will again make you live in tents, as in the days of the appointed festival.
28:12:10/I have also spoken through the prophets, and I have given many visions, and through the prophets, I have used parables.
28:12:11/Is there wickedness in Gilead? Certainly, they are worthless: they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal; indeed, their altars are like piles of stones in the plowed fields.
28:12:12/And Jacob fled to the land of Aram, and Israel worked for a wife, and for a wife, he tended sheep.
28:12:13/And through a prophet, the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and through a prophet, he was kept safe.
28:12:14/Ephraim bitterly provoked Him to anger: therefore, his bloodguilt will be left on him, and his Lord will return his disgrace upon him.
28:13:1/When Ephraim spoke with fear, he was honored in Israel; but when he sinned by worshiping Baal, he faced his downfall.
28:13:2/And now they continue to sin more and more, creating silver idols and images with their own designs, all crafted by artisans. They even say to these idols, "Let those who offer sacrifices kiss the calves."
28:13:3/Therefore, they will disappear like the morning fog and the early dew, like chaff blown away by the wind, and like smoke from a chimney.
28:13:4/Yet I am the LORD your God since the time of Egypt, and you should recognize no god but me: for there is no savior besides me.
28:13:5/I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of severe drought.
28:13:6/They were satisfied according to their pasture; they were filled, and their heart became proud; therefore, they have forgotten me.
28:13:7/So, I will be to them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk along their path:
28:13:8/I will confront them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and I will tear open their heart, and there I will devour them like a lion: the wild beast will tear them apart.
28:13:9/O Israel, you have brought destruction upon yourself; but your help is in me.
28:13:10/I will be your king: where is any other that can save you in all your cities? and your judges to whom you said, "Give us a king and princes"?
28:13:11/I gave you a king in my anger, and took him away in my wrath.
28:13:12/The guilt of Ephraim is stored up; his sin is kept secret.
28:13:13/The pains of childbirth will come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long at the birth canal.
28:13:14/I will rescue them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be your destruction: repentance will be hidden from my eyes.
28:13:15/Even if he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come, the wind of the LORD will rise from the wilderness, and his source of water will dry up, and his spring will fail: he will plunder the treasures of all precious vessels.
28:13:16/Samaria will be left in ruins; for she has rebelled against her God: they will fall by the sword: their infants will be smashed to the ground, and their pregnant women will be torn open.
28:14:1/Israel, return to the LORD your God; for you have fallen due to your sin.
28:14:2/Bring your words and turn to the LORD: say to him, "Remove all our sins, and accept us graciously: so we will offer the praise of our lips."
28:14:3/Assyria won't save us; we won't rely on horses: nor will we say to our handmade idols, 'You are our gods.' For in you, the orphan finds compassion.
28:14:4/I will heal their waywardness, I will love them unconditionally: for my anger has turned away from them.
28:14:5/I will be like the dew to Israel: he will flourish like the lily, and his roots will grow deep like those of Lebanon.
28:14:6/His branches will spread out, and his beauty will be like the olive tree, and his fragrance like Lebanon.
28:14:7/Those who live in his shadow will come back; they will flourish like the grain, and grow like the vine: their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.
28:14:8/Ephraim will say, "What do I have to do with idols anymore? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is your fruit found."
28:14:9/Who is wise, and will understand these things? Who is discerning, and will know them? For the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous will walk in them: but the rebels will stumble in them.
29:1:1/The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
29:1:2/Listen up, elders, and everyone living in the land. Have you ever seen anything like this in your lifetime or in the lifetime of your ancestors?
29:1:3/Tell your children about it, let them tell their children, and those children tell the next generation.
29:1:4/What the palmerworm left, the locust has eaten; what the locust left, the cankerworm has eaten; and what the cankerworm left, the caterpillar has eaten.
29:1:5/Wake up, you drunkards, and cry; wail, all you wine drinkers, over the sweet wine, for it's taken away from your lips.
29:1:6/A nation has invaded my land, mighty and without number, with teeth like a lion and fangs of a mighty lion.
29:1:7/It has ruined my vines and stripped my fig trees bare, leaving them white and thrown away.
29:1:8/Mourn like a young woman in sackcloth grieving for the fiancé of her youth.
29:1:9/The grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’s ministers, are in mourning.
29:1:10/The fields are ruined, the ground is grieving; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil fails.
29:1:11/Feel ashamed, you farmers; wail, you vine growers, over the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is lost.
29:1:12/The vine is dried up, and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm, and the apple tree—all the trees of the field are dried up. Indeed, joy has dried up among people.
29:1:13/Dress in sackcloth and mourn, you priests; wail, you ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God; for the grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
29:1:14/Declare a holy fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
29:1:15/How terrible for that day! For the day of the LORD is near, and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
29:1:16/Isn't the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
29:1:17/The seeds shrivel under the clods; the storehouses are desolate, the granaries are torn down because the grain has withered.
29:1:18/Listen to how the animals groan! The herds of cattle wander aimlessly because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
29:1:19/To you, O LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the open pastures and flames have burned all the trees of the field.
29:1:20/Even the wild animals cry out to you because the water streams are dried up, and fire has devoured the open pastures.
29:2:1/Sound the trumpet in Zion, and raise the alarm on my holy mountain: let everyone in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming; it's almost here;
29:2:2/A day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and deep darkness, like dawn spreading across the mountains: a vast and powerful army comes, such as has never been seen before, nor will be again in the ages to come.
29:2:3/A fire consumes everything before them; and behind them, flames blaze: the land before them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it's a desolate wasteland; nothing at all escapes them.
29:2:4/They look like horses; they charge forward like cavalry.
29:2:5/With a noise like that of chariots on the mountaintops they leap, like the crackling of a fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army ready for battle.
29:2:6/People are in anguish before them; every face turns pale.
29:2:7/They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers. They each march straight ahead, not swerving from their paths.
29:2:8/They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.
29:2:9/They rush upon the city; they run along the wall. They climb into houses; they enter through windows like thieves.
29:2:10/The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars no longer shine.
29:2:11/And the LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty is the one who obeys his command. The day of the LORD is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it?
29:2:12/Even now, declares the LORD, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, crying, and mourning.
29:2:13/Tear your heart and not your clothes. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love, and relents from sending calamity.
29:2:14/Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing—grain offerings and drink offerings for the LORD your God.
29:2:15/Sound the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly.
29:2:16/Gather the people, consecrate the assembly; bring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.
29:2:17/Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"
29:2:18/Then the LORD will be zealous for his land and take pity on his people.
29:2:19/The LORD will reply to his people, "Look, I am sending you grain, new wine, and oil. You will be satisfied with them. I will no longer make you an object of scorn among the nations.
29:2:20/But I will drive the northern army far from you, pushing it into a parched and desolate land, its front columns into the eastern sea and its rear guard into the western sea. And its stench will go up; its foul smell will rise." Surely he has done great things.
29:2:21/Do not fear, O land; be glad and rejoice. Surely the LORD has done great things.
29:2:22/Do not be afraid, you animals of the field, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green. The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches.
29:2:23/Then be glad, people of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.
29:2:24/The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
29:2:25/I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten—the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm—my great army that I sent among you.
29:2:26/You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed.
29:2:27/Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed.
29:2:28/And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
29:2:29/Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
29:2:30/I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
29:2:31/The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.
29:2:32/And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, among the survivors whom the LORD calls.
29:3:1/For, look, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29:3:2/I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will put them on trial for what they did to my people and my inheritance, Israel, because they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land.
29:3:3/They cast lots for my people, traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine to drink.
29:3:4/And what business do you have with me, O Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Palestine? Are you trying to pay me back for something? If you are, I will swiftly and speedily bring your actions back on your own heads.
29:3:5/Because you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,
29:3:6/You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, removing them far from their homeland.
29:3:7/See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return your actions on your own heads.
29:3:8/I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away. The LORD has spoken.
29:3:9/Announce this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.
29:3:10/Turn your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, 'I am strong.'
29:3:11/Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, LORD.
29:3:12/Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side.
29:3:13/Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!
29:3:14/Crowds upon crowds in the Valley of Decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the Valley of Decision.
29:3:15/The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars will stop shining.
29:3:16/The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.
29:3:17/Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her.
29:3:18/In that day, the mountains will drip with new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the streams of Judah will run with water. A spring will flow out of the LORD's house and will water the Valley of Shittim.
29:3:19/Egypt will become a wasteland, and Edom will become a barren desert, because of the violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.
29:3:20/But Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations.
29:3:21/I will pardon their bloodshed that I have not pardoned: for the LORD dwells in Zion.
30:1:1/The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
30:1:2/And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and raise His voice from Jerusalem; the homes of the shepherds will grieve, and the summit of Carmel will dry up.
30:1:3/Thus says the LORD; For three sins of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they have brutally threshed Gilead with iron instruments: 
30:1:4/But I will send a fire into Hazael's house, which will consume the palaces of Benhadad.
30:1:5/I will also break the stronghold of Damascus, and eliminate the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and the one who holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria will be taken captive to Kir, says the LORD.
30:1:6/Thus says the LORD; For three sins of Gaza, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they took away an entire population, to hand them over to Edom:
30:1:7/But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which will consume its palaces: 
30:1:8/And I will eliminate the inhabitant from Ashdod, and the one who holds the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron: and the last of the Philistines will perish, says the Lord GOD.
30:1:9/Thus says the LORD; For three sins of Tyre, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they handed over an entire population to Edom, and forgot the covenant of brotherhood: 
30:1:10/But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, which will consume its palaces.
30:1:11/Thus says the LORD; For three sins of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because he chased his brother with the sword, showing no compassion, his anger tore perpetually, and he maintained his fury forever: 
30:1:12/But I will send a fire upon Teman, which will consume the palaces of Bozrah.
30:1:13/Thus says the LORD; For three sins of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they have violently ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, to expand their territory: 
30:1:14/But I will ignite a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it will consume its palaces, with shouting on the day of battle, with a storm on the day of the whirlwind: 
30:1:15/And their king will go into captivity, he and his officials together, says the LORD.
30:2:1/The LORD says: Because Moab has committed four major sins, I won't hold back punishment. They turned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.
30:2:2/But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it will consume the palaces of Kirioth. Moab will perish amid chaos, shouting, and the sound of the trumpet.
30:2:3/I will eliminate the judge from its midst and kill all its leaders along with him, says the LORD.
30:2:4/The LORD says: Because Judah has committed four major sins, I won't hold back punishment. They have rejected the law of the LORD, ignored his commands, and their lies led them astray, just like their ancestors.
30:2:5/But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it will consume the palaces of Jerusalem.
30:2:6/The LORD says: Because Israel has committed four major sins, I won't hold back punishment. They traded the innocent for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.
30:2:7/They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed. A father and son use the same girl, desecrating my holy name.
30:2:8/They lie down on garments taken as pledges beside every altar, and drink wine bought with fines in the house of their god.
30:2:9/Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them, who were as tall as cedars and as strong as oaks, destroying their fruit above and roots below.
30:2:10/Also, I brought you up from Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness to give you the land of the Amorite.
30:2:11/And I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazarites from your young men. Isn't this true, people of Israel? says the LORD.
30:2:12/But you made the Nazarites drink wine and told the prophets not to prophesy.
30:2:13/Behold, I am burdened by you, as a cart is burdened when it's full of sheaves.
30:2:14/Therefore, the swift will not escape, the strong will not muster their strength, and the warrior will not save himself.
30:2:15/The archer won't stand his ground, the swift-footed won't escape, and the horseman won't save himself.
30:2:16/And the bravest warriors will flee naked on that day, says the LORD.
30:3:1/Listen to this message that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the entire family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,
30:3:2/I have only known you out of all the families of the earth; therefore, I will punish you for all your wrongdoings.
30:3:3/Can two walk together without agreeing to do so?
30:3:4/Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey? Does a young lion cry out from its den if it hasn't caught anything?
30:3:5/Can a bird get caught in a trap on the ground if no trap has been set for it? Can someone remove a trap from the ground if it hasn't caught anything?
30:3:6/If a trumpet sounds in a city, won't the people be alarmed? If disaster strikes a city, hasn't the LORD caused it?
30:3:7/Indeed, the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.
30:3:8/The lion has roared; who wouldn't be afraid? The Lord GOD has spoken; who wouldn't prophesy?
30:3:9/Announce in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Gather on the mountains of Samaria, and see the great chaos within it and the oppression in its midst.
30:3:10/For they do not know how to do right, says the LORD, who hoard violence and robbery in their palaces.
30:3:11/Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: An enemy will surround the land; he will bring down your strength from you, and your palaces will be plundered.
30:3:12/This is what the LORD says: As the shepherd rescues from the lion's mouth only two legs or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the corner of a bed or part of a couch.
30:3:13/Listen and testify against the house of Jacob, declares the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
30:3:14/On the day I punish Israel for its transgressions, I will also destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
30:3:15/And I will strike the winter house along with the summer house; the houses of ivory will perish, and the great houses will come to an end, declares the LORD.
30:4:1/Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you who oppress the poor and crush the needy, who tell your lords, "Bring us drinks."
30:4:2/The Sovereign LORD has sworn by his holiness that the time will come upon you when you will be taken away with hooks, and your descendants with fishhooks.
30:4:3/You will go out through the breaches in the walls, each cow straight ahead; and you will be thrown into the palace, declares the LORD.
30:4:4/Go to Bethel and sin more; in Gilgal, increase your sins. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years.
30:4:5/Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice with yeast, and announce and publicize your voluntary offerings; for you love doing this, O children of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD.
30:4:6/I also gave you clean teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places, yet you have not returned to me, declares the LORD.
30:4:7/I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one city but withheld it from another. One field received rain, and the field that received no rain withered.
30:4:8/So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to me, declares the LORD.
30:4:9/I struck you with blight and mildew. When your gardens and vineyards, your fig trees and olive trees increased, the locust devoured them; yet you have not returned to me, declares the LORD.
30:4:10/I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps; yet you have not returned to me, declares the LORD.
30:4:11/I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a burning stick snatched from the fire; yet you have not returned to me, declares the LORD.
30:4:12/Therefore, this is what I will do to you, Israel; and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.
30:4:13/For he who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn into darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth—The LORD, The God of Hosts, is his name.
30:5:1/Listen to this word I am proclaiming against you, a lamentation, O house of Israel.
30:5:2/The virgin of Israel has fallen; she will not rise again: she is abandoned on her land with no one to lift her up.
30:5:3/For this is what the Lord GOD says; The city that sends out a thousand will only have a hundred left, and the one that sends out a hundred will only have ten left for the house of Israel.
30:5:4/For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel, Search for me, and you will live:
30:5:5/But do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, and do not journey to Beersheba: for Gilgal will surely be taken into exile, and Bethel will come to nothing.
30:5:6/Search for the LORD, and you will live; otherwise, he might burst forth like fire on the house of Joseph, consuming it with no one in Bethel to extinguish it.
30:5:7/You who turn justice into bitterness and cast aside righteousness in the earth,
30:5:8/Search for the one who creates the Pleiades and Orion, who turns deep darkness into morning and darkens day into night: who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the surface of the earth: The LORD is his name:
30:5:9/He empowers the weak against the mighty, so that the weak may challenge the strongholds.
30:5:10/They despise the one who rebukes at the city gate, and they detest the one who speaks honestly.
30:5:11/Since you trample on the poor and take from them levies of grain: you have built houses of cut stone, but you will not live in them; you have planted delightful vineyards, but you will not drink their wine.
30:5:12/For I am aware of your numerous transgressions and your significant sins: you oppress the righteous, accept bribes, and deny the poor justice at the city gates.
30:5:13/Therefore, the wise will remain silent at such a time; for it is a time of evil.
30:5:14/Seek what is good, not what is evil, so that you may live: and thus the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have claimed.
30:5:15/Hate what is evil, love what is good, and establish justice at the city gates: perhaps the LORD God of hosts will show mercy to the remnants of Joseph.
30:5:16/Therefore, the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, says this; Crying will be heard in all the streets; and they will say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they will summon the farmers to mourn, and those skilled in lamentation to wail.
30:5:17/And in all the vineyards there will be wailing: for I will pass through you, says the LORD.
30:5:18/Woe to those who long for the day of the LORD! Why do you want it? The day of the LORD is darkness, not light.
30:5:19/It's as if a man fled from a lion, only to meet a bear; or went into the house, rested his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him.
30:5:20/Won't the day of the LORD be darkness, not light? Completely dark, with no glimmer of brightness?
30:5:21/I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
30:5:22/Even though you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them: nor will I look at the fellowship offerings of your fattened animals.
30:5:23/Remove from me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the melody of your stringed instruments.
30:5:24/But let justice flow like water, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
30:5:25/Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
30:5:26/Yet you have carried the shrine of your king and the pedestals of your idols, the star of your god which you made for yourselves.
30:5:27/Therefore, I will send you into exile beyond Damascus, says the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.
30:6:1/Woe to those who are complacent in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, named leaders of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
30:6:2/Go over to Calneh and see; then from there go to Hamath the great: then head down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their territory larger than your territory?
30:6:3/You who postpone the day of disaster and bring near a reign of violence;
30:6:4/Who lie on beds of ivory and lounge on their couches, and eat lambs from the flock and calves from the stall;
30:6:5/Who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp and like David invent for themselves instruments of music;
30:6:6/Who drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
30:6:7/Therefore, they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles, and the revelry of those who lounge will pass away.
30:6:8/The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, says the LORD the God of hosts, I detest the pride of Jacob and hate his fortresses; therefore, I will deliver up the city and everything in it.
30:6:9/And it shall happen, if ten men remain in one house, they too shall die.
30:6:10/And when a relative, one who burns the bodies, picks up someone to take the bones out of the house, and says to anyone inside the house, "Is anyone else with you?" and they say, "No," then he will say, "Keep quiet! We must not invoke the name of the LORD."
30:6:11/For, look, the LORD commands, and the large house will be smashed to pieces and the small house to bits.
30:6:12/Can horses run on the rocks? Can one plow the sea with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness,
30:6:13/You who rejoice in worthless things, who boast, "Have we not taken horns for ourselves by our own strength?"
30:6:14/But, look, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, says the LORD the God of hosts; and they will oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.
30:7:1/The Lord GOD showed me a vision; I saw him creating locusts at the start of the late crop season, right after the king's harvest.
30:7:2/When the locusts had finished eating the crops across the land, I pleaded, "O Lord GOD, please forgive us. How can Jacob survive? He is so weak."
30:7:3/The LORD changed his mind about this. "It won't happen," said the LORD.
30:7:4/Then the Lord GOD showed me another vision: He summoned a fire that consumed the great deep and began to devour the land.
30:7:5/I cried out again, "O Lord GOD, please stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so weak."
30:7:6/The LORD changed his mind about this too. "This also won't happen," said the Lord GOD.
30:7:7/In another vision, the LORD stood beside a wall built with a plumb line, holding a plumb line in his hand.
30:7:8/And the LORD asked me, "Amos, what do you see?" I replied, "A plumb line." Then the LORD said, "Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will no longer overlook their sins.
30:7:9/The high places of Isaac will be deserted, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be in ruins; I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword."
30:7:10/Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, "Amos is plotting against you within the house of Israel; the country cannot endure all his words.
30:7:11/For this is what Amos is saying: 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely be exiled from their land.'"
30:7:12/Amaziah also said to Amos, "You seer, go, run away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and do your prophesying there.
30:7:13/But never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the royal sanctuary and the national temple."
30:7:14/Amos replied to Amaziah, "I was not a prophet, nor was I the son of a prophet; I was a shepherd and a tender of sycamore figs.
30:7:15/But the LORD took me from following the flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'
30:7:16/Now then, listen to the word of the LORD: You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.'
30:7:17/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be divided up with a measuring line, and you yourself will die in a defiled land. And Israel will certainly go into exile, away from their homeland.'"
30:8:1/The Lord GOD showed me a vision: I saw a basket of summer fruit.
30:8:2/He asked, "Amos, what do you see?" I replied, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said, "The end has come for my people Israel; I will not overlook their actions any longer."
30:8:3/The songs of the temple will turn into wails on that day," says the Lord GOD. "There will be many dead bodies everywhere, silently thrown out."
30:8:4/Listen, you who trample on the needy and destroy the poor of the land,
30:8:5/You who say, "When will the new moon be over so we can sell grain? And the Sabbath, so we can market wheat?"—skimping on the measure, boosting the price, and cheating with dishonest scales,
30:8:6/So you can buy the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings of the wheat.
30:8:7/The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob: "I will never forget any of their deeds.
30:8:8/Won't the land tremble for this, and everyone mourn who lives in it? It will all rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.
30:8:9/On that day," declares the Lord GOD, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
30:8:10/I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth on every waist and baldness on every head. I will make it like mourning for an only son, and its end like a bitter day.
30:8:11/Behold, the days are coming," declares the Lord GOD, "when I will send a famine through the land—not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
30:8:12/People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.
30:8:13/In that day the beautiful virgins and strong young men will faint from thirst.
30:8:14/Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria, who say, 'As your god lives, O Dan,' and, 'As the way of Beersheba lives,' they will fall, never to rise again.
30:9:1/I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Strike the top of the door so that the pillars tremble: and strike down all of them on the head; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: those who flee will not get away, and those who escape will not be saved.
30:9:2/Even if they dig into hell, from there my hand will take them; even if they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down.
30:9:3/And even if they hide on the peak of Carmel, I will search and take them from there; and if they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.
30:9:4/And if they are taken captive by their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it will kill them: and I will set my eyes on them for harm, and not for good.
30:9:5/And the Lord GOD of hosts is the one who touches the land, and it will melt, and everyone living in it will mourn: and it will rise up completely like a flood; and will be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
30:9:6/He is the one who builds his layers in the heavens, and has established his group on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the surface of the earth: The LORD is his name.
30:9:7/Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? says the LORD. Haven't I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
30:9:8/Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, and I will wipe it off the face of the earth; except that I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, says the LORD.
30:9:9/For, look, I will command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is shaken in a sieve, yet not the smallest grain will fall to the ground.
30:9:10/All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, those who say, The disaster will not overtake or meet us.
30:9:11/On that day I will restore the fallen shelter of David, and repair its gaps; and I will restore its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old.
30:9:12/So that they may take over the remnants of Edom, and all the nations that bear my name, says the LORD who does this.
30:9:13/Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when the plowman will catch up with the reaper, and the one treading grapes will overtake the one sowing seed; and the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and all the hills will melt.
30:9:14/And I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them; they will plant vineyards and drink their wine, they will also make gardens and eat their fruit.
30:9:15/And I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be uprooted from their land which I have given them, says the LORD your God.
31:1:1/The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord GOD says about Edom; We've heard a rumor from the LORD, and a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying, "Get up, let's go to war against her."
31:1:2/Look, I've made you insignificant among the nations: you are deeply scorned.
31:1:3/Your own arrogance has misled you, you who live in the mountain clefts, in your lofty home, thinking, "Who can bring me down to the ground?"
31:1:4/Even if you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, I will bring you down from there, declares the LORD.
31:1:5/If thieves came to you, if robbers in the night—oh, how you have been destroyed!—wouldn't they only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn't they leave a few grapes?
31:1:6/How Esau's treasures are searched out, how his hidden things are discovered!
31:1:7/All your allies have driven you to the border; those at peace with you have deceived you and prevailed against you; those who eat your bread have set a trap beneath you— you have no understanding.
31:1:8/Won't I on that day, declares the LORD, destroy the wise men from Edom, and understanding from the mountain of Esau?
31:1:9/And your warriors, O Teman, will be terrified, so that everyone from the mountain of Esau will be cut down by slaughter.
31:1:10/Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.
31:1:11/On the day you stood aloof, on the day that strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were just like one of them.
31:1:12/But you should not have gloated over your brother on the day of his misfortune; you should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah on the day of their destruction; you should not have boasted on the day of distress.
31:1:13/You should not have entered the gate of my people on the day of their calamity; indeed, you should not have gloated over their misfortune on the day of their calamity, nor laid hands on their wealth on the day of their calamity.
31:1:14/You should not have stood at the crossroads to cut off those who escaped; nor should you have handed over those who survived on the day of distress.
31:1:15/For the day of the LORD is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head.
31:1:16/Just as you drank on my holy hill, so all the nations will drink continually. They will drink and gulp down, and they will be as if they had never been.
31:1:17/But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance, it will be holy, and the house of Jacob will reclaim their inheritance.
31:1:18/The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau will be stubble. They will ignite and consume them, and there will be no survivors from the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken.
31:1:19/Those from the Negev will take possession of the mountain of Esau, and those from the plains the Philistines. They will possess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
31:1:20/The exiles of this army of the children of Israel will possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath; the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negev.
31:1:21/And deliverers will ascend Mount Zion to govern the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will belong to the LORD.
32:1:1/The word of the LORD came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, with a message.
32:1:2/Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it; because their evil deeds have reached me.
32:1:3/But Jonah decided to run away to Tarshish, avoiding the LORD's presence. He went down to Joppa, found a ship heading to Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded it to escape from the LORD.
32:1:4/However, the LORD unleashed a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart.
32:1:5/The sailors were terrified, each praying to his own god, and they threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone below deck, where he fell into a deep sleep.
32:1:6/The captain went to him and said, "What are you doing asleep? Get up and pray to your god! Maybe he will pay attention to us, and we won't perish."
32:1:7/They said to one another, "Let's cast lots to find out who is responsible for this disaster." They cast lots, and the lot pointed to Jonah.
32:1:8/So they asked him, "Please tell us, who is to blame for this disaster? What's your job? Where do you come from? What's your country? And what people are you from?"
32:1:9/He answered them, "I am a Hebrew; and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the land."
32:1:10/The men were terrified and asked him, "Why did you do this?" They knew he was running away from the LORD because he had told them.
32:1:11/Then they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?" For the sea was getting more and more stormy.
32:1:12/He replied, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea, and it will become calm. I know that it's my fault this great storm has come upon you."
32:1:13/Despite their efforts to row back to land, they couldn't, because the sea grew even wilder against them.
32:1:14/Therefore, they cried out to the LORD, "Please, LORD, don't let us die for taking this man's life. Don't hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, LORD, have done as you pleased."
32:1:15/So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
32:1:16/Then the men greatly feared the LORD, offered a sacrifice to the LORD, and made vows.
32:1:17/Meanwhile, the LORD provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.
32:2:1/Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from inside the fish,
32:2:2/And said, I cried out because of my suffering to the LORD, and he heard me; from the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.
32:2:3/For you threw me into the deep, into the heart of the seas; and the floods surrounded me: all your waves and your billows swept over me.
32:2:4/Then I thought, I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
32:2:5/The waters surrounded me, threatening my life; the deep enclosed me, seaweed was tangled around my head.
32:2:6/I sank down to the roots of the mountains; the earth with its bars closed behind me forever: yet you have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
32:2:7/When my life was ebbing away, I remembered the LORD: and my prayer reached you, into your holy temple.
32:2:8/Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them.
32:2:9/But with shouts of grateful praise, I will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD.
32:2:10/And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
32:3:1/The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,
32:3:2/Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and deliver the message I have given you.
32:3:3/So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh, as the LORD had instructed. Nineveh was an extremely large city, taking three days to go through.
32:3:4/Jonah started into the city, walking for a day, and he announced, "In forty days, Nineveh will be destroyed."
32:3:5/The people of Nineveh believed God, declared a fast, and everyone, from the greatest to the least, wore sackcloth.
32:3:6/When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
32:3:7/He ordered a proclamation to be made throughout Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles: "No human or animal, herd or flock, shall taste anything; they shall not eat or drink water.
32:3:8/But let humans and animals be covered with sackcloth, and let them urgently call out to God. Let everyone turn from their evil ways and from the violence in their hands.
32:3:9/Who knows? God may turn and relent, and turn from his fierce anger so that we do not perish."
32:3:10/And God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways; and God relented from the disaster that he had said he would bring upon them, and he did not do it.
32:4:1/But Jonah was extremely upset by this, and he was very angry.
32:4:2/He prayed to the LORD, saying, "Oh LORD, didn't I say this when I was still in my own country? That's why I ran away to Tarshish: because I knew you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, abounding in love, and you relent from sending calamity.
32:4:3/So now, LORD, please take my life from me; it's better for me to die than to live."
32:4:4/Then the LORD asked, "Do you have a good reason to be angry?"
32:4:5/So Jonah left the city and sat to the east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade, and waited to see what would happen to the city.
32:4:6/And the LORD God provided a plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort. Jonah was very happy about the plant.
32:4:7/But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered.
32:4:8/As the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die and said, "It's better for me to die than to live."
32:4:9/But God said to Jonah, "Do you have a good reason to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die."
32:4:10/Then the LORD said, "You cared about the plant, which you did not labor over and did not grow; it came up in a night and perished in a night.
32:4:11/Should I not have concern for Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?"
33:1:1/The message from the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he received concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
33:1:2/Listen up, everyone; pay attention, Earth, and everything in it: and let the Lord GOD stand as a witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple.
33:1:3/For, look, the LORD is leaving his place and will descend to walk on the high places of the earth.
33:1:4/And the mountains will melt under him, and the valleys will split open, like wax before the fire, and like water rushing down a slope.
33:1:5/All this is because of Jacob's rebellion and the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacob's rebellion? Isn't it Samaria? And what are Judah's high places? Aren't they Jerusalem?
33:1:6/So, I will turn Samaria into a pile of rubble in the field, like a spot for planting a vineyard: and I will tumble its stones down into the valley, revealing its foundations.
33:1:7/And all its carved images will be smashed, all its paid-for treasures will be burned with fire, and all its idols I will leave in ruins: because she earned them through prostitution, and they will go back to being used for prostitution.
33:1:8/That's why I will wail and howl, I will go about bare and naked: I will wail like the dragons and mourn like the owls.
33:1:9/Because her injury is fatal; it has reached Judah; it has reached the gate of my people, all the way to Jerusalem.
33:1:10/Don't announce it in Gath, don't cry at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.
33:1:11/Move on, you who live in Saphir, in shameful nakedness: the residents of Zaanan did not come out to mourn for Bethezel; they will receive from you their stand.
33:1:12/The residents of Maroth anxiously waited for relief, but disaster came from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
33:1:13/You who live in Lachish, hitch the chariot to the fastest horses: you were the beginning of sin for the daughter of Zion, for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.
33:1:14/Therefore, you must send gifts to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib will prove to be a deception to the kings of Israel.
33:1:15/Yet I will bring an heir to you, O resident of Mareshah: he will come to Adullam, the glory of Israel.
33:1:16/Shave your head and cut off your hair in mourning for your precious children; make your baldness as wide as an eagle; for they have gone into captivity away from you.
33:2:1/Doom to those who plan wrongdoing and do evil deeds in their beds! When daylight comes, they carry it out because they have the power to do so.
33:2:2/They covet fields and seize them by force; they desire houses and take them: thus they oppress people and their homes, even a person and their inheritance.
33:2:3/Therefore, this is what the LORD says; Look, I am planning a disaster against this family from which you won't be able to escape; you will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.
33:2:4/On that day, someone will recite a sad story about you, mourn with a bitter cry, and say, 'We are completely ruined: he has transferred the rights of my people; how he has taken them away from me! He has divided our fields among others.'
33:2:5/As a result, you will have no one in the LORD's assembly to throw a measuring line for land.
33:2:6/'Don't prophesy,' they tell the prophets. 'Don't prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us.'
33:2:7/You who are called the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD limited? Are these his actions? Don't my words benefit those who live righteously?
33:2:8/Recently, my people have acted as an enemy: you strip the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.
33:2:9/You have driven the women of my people from their comfortable homes; from their children, you have taken away my glory forever.
33:2:10/Get up and go, for this is not your place of rest; because it is defiled, it will destroy you with a grievous destruction.
33:2:11/If someone deceitfully prophesies about wine and strong drink, he would be the preferred prophet of this people.
33:2:12/I will surely gather all of you, Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture, noisy with people.
33:2:13/The one who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head.
33:3:1/And I said, Listen, please, O leaders of Jacob, and you rulers of the house of Israel; Shouldn't you know how to make fair decisions?
33:3:2/Who despise what is good, and love what is evil; who tear off their skin and their flesh from their bones;
33:3:3/Who also consume the flesh of my people, and strip their skin from them; they break their bones, and cut them up like meat for the pot, like flesh in the cauldron.
33:3:4/Then they will cry to the LORD, but he will not listen to them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, because they have acted terribly in their deeds.
33:3:5/This is what the LORD says about the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth and proclaim, 'Peace'; and if someone doesn't feed them, they prepare to declare war against him.
33:3:6/Therefore, you will be in darkness, unable to see visions; it will be dark for you, unable to predict; and the sun will set on the prophets, and the day will turn dark over them.
33:3:7/Then the seers will be ashamed, and the diviners disgraced: indeed, they will all cover their mouths; for there will be no answer from God.
33:3:8/But truly I am filled with power by the spirit of the LORD, and with justice and strength, to declare to Jacob his wrongdoing, and to Israel his sin.
33:3:9/Listen to this, I beg you, you leaders of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who detest fair judgment, and twist all that is right.
33:3:10/They build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wrongdoing.
33:3:11/The leaders judge for bribes, the priests teach for a price, and the prophets tell fortunes for money: yet they rely on the LORD, saying, 'Isn't the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us.'
33:3:12/Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the mountain of the temple will be like the high places of a forest.
33:4:1/But in the last days, it will happen that the mountain where the LORD's house stands will be the highest of all, towering over the hills. People from all over will stream to it.
33:4:2/And many nations will come and say, "Let's go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so we can walk in his paths." The law will come from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
33:4:3/He will settle disputes for many peoples and correct strong nations far away. They'll turn their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
33:4:4/Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, with no one to make them afraid, because the LORD Almighty has said so.
33:4:5/All people will walk in the name of their god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
33:4:6/On that day, says the LORD, I will gather those who are limping and assemble those who were scattered and those I have hurt.
33:4:7/I will make the limping ones a remnant and those who were far off a strong nation. The LORD will rule over them on Mount Zion from that day and forever.
33:4:8/And you, watchtower of the flock, stronghold of Daughter Zion, to you it will come, even the former dominion will come, the kingdom to Daughter Jerusalem.
33:4:9/Now why do you cry out loud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seizes you like a woman in labor?
33:4:10/Writhe in agony and labor to give birth, Daughter Zion, like a woman in childbirth. For now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you from the grip of your enemies.
33:4:11/Now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"
33:4:12/But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
33:4:13/Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will make your horn iron and your hooves bronze, so you can crush many peoples. I will dedicate their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
33:5:1/Gather together, O daughter of warriors: we are under siege: the leader of Israel will be struck on the face with a rod.
33:5:2/But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, from you will come forth the one who will rule over Israel; his origins are from ancient times, from eternity.
33:5:3/So he will abandon them until the time when she who is in labor gives birth; then the rest of his brothers will return to the people of Israel.
33:5:4/He will stand and shepherd in the power of the LORD, in the splendor of the name of the LORD his God; and they will live securely, for then he will be honored throughout the earth.
33:5:5/This man will be our peace when the Assyrian invades our land and marches through our fortresses. We will raise against him seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men.
33:5:6/They will devastate the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its entrances. He will deliver us from the Assyrian when he invades our land and marches within our borders.
33:5:7/The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or depend on human will.
33:5:8/And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which, if it passes through, tramples and tears to pieces, with no one to rescue.
33:5:9/Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your adversaries will be eliminated.
33:5:10/In that day, declares the LORD, I will remove your horses from among you and destroy your chariots.
33:5:11/I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your fortresses.
33:5:12/I will eliminate sorcery from your hand; you will no longer have fortune-tellers.
33:5:13/I will also remove your carved images and your sacred pillars from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
33:5:14/I will uproot your Asherah poles from among you and demolish your cities.
33:5:15/I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed.
33:6:1/Listen to what the LORD says; Stand up, argue your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
33:6:2/Listen, O mountains, to the LORD’s dispute, and you enduring foundations of the earth: for the LORD has a dispute with his people, and he will argue his case with Israel.
33:6:3/My people, what have I done to you? How have I tired you? Answer me.
33:6:4/For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and rescued you from a life of slavery; I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
33:6:5/My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted, and what Balaam son of Beor answered him, from Shittim to Gilgal, so you may recognize the righteousness of the LORD.
33:6:6/How should I come before the LORD, and bow down before the exalted God? Should I come to him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves?
33:6:7/Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Should I offer my firstborn for my wrongdoing, the child of my body for the sin of my soul?
33:6:8/He has shown you, O human, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to act justly, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?
33:6:9/The LORD’s voice calls to the city, and the wise will see your name: pay attention to the rod, and who has appointed it.
33:6:10/Are there still treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the short measure that is detestable?
33:6:11/Can I justify wicked scales and a bag of fraudulent weights?
33:6:12/For the wealthy among you are full of violence, and the residents have lied, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
33:6:13/Therefore, I will also make you sick by striking you, making you desolate because of your sins.
33:6:14/You will eat, but not be satisfied; your hunger will remain inside you; you will try to save, but you will not succeed; and what you do save, I will give to the sword.
33:6:15/You will plant, but not harvest; you will press olives, but not use the oil; and make wine, but not drink it.
33:6:16/Because you follow the practices of Omri and all the deeds of Ahab’s house, and you follow their advice, I will make you a ruin, and your inhabitants an object of scorn; therefore, you will bear the disgrace of my people.
33:7:1/Alas for me! I feel like I'm searching for summer fruits or the last grapes after the harvest: there's nothing left to eat; I long for the first ripe fruits.
33:7:2/The virtuous are gone from the earth; there's no one honest left among people: they all set traps to shed blood; they hunt their own brothers with malice.
33:7:3/They're eager to do wrong; leaders and judges demand bribes; the powerful articulate their harmful wishes: thus, they conspire together.
33:7:4/The best among them is like a thorn bush; the most honest is more dangerous than a thorn fence: the time of your watchmen, your punishment, is coming; soon they will be in confusion.
33:7:5/Don't trust a friend, don't confide in a close companion; be careful what you say to the one closest to you.
33:7:6/For a son disrespects his father, a daughter opposes her mother, a daughter-in-law her mother-in-law; a person's enemies are those of his own household.
33:7:7/So, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God who saves me: my God will hear me.
33:7:8/Don't gloat over me, my enemy: though I fall, I will rise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.
33:7:9/I will endure the LORD's anger because I have sinned against him, until he defends my cause and establishes justice for me: he will bring me into the light, and I will see his righteousness.
33:7:10/Then my enemy, who questioned my faith in the LORD, will see God's vindication and be covered with shame; she will be trampled like mud in the streets.
33:7:11/When the time comes to rebuild your walls, that day will see the boundaries extended.
33:7:12/On that day, people will come to you from Assyria and the fortified cities, from the fortresses to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.
33:7:13/Yet the land will be desolate because of its inhabitants, as a result of their actions.
33:7:14/Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, living alone in a forest in the midst of Carmel: let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in days of old.
33:7:15/As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them wonders.
33:7:16/The nations will see and be ashamed of their power; they will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf.
33:7:17/They will lick the dust like a snake, they will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you.
33:7:18/Who is a God like you, who forgives sin and overlooks the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? He does not hold on to his anger forever because he delights in showing mercy.
33:7:19/He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
33:7:20/You will show faithfulness to Jacob and mercy to Abraham, as you have sworn to our ancestors from days long ago.
34:1:1/The message concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
34:1:2/God is passionate, and the LORD seeks revenge; the LORD seeks revenge and is intensely angry; the LORD will take vengeance on his foes and stores up wrath for his enemies.
34:1:3/The LORD is patient and immensely powerful, and will by no means let the guilty go unpunished: the LORD directs the whirlwind and the storm, and the clouds are the dust beneath his feet.
34:1:4/He scolds the sea, making it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan withers, as do Carmel, and the blossoms of Lebanon wither.
34:1:5/The mountains tremble before him, the hills dissolve, and the earth burns in his presence, indeed, the world and all who live in it.
34:1:6/Who can withstand his anger? And who can endure his fierce rage? His fury is unleashed like fire, and the rocks are shattered by him.
34:1:7/The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble; and he knows those who trust in him.
34:1:8/But with a sweeping flood, he will completely destroy its place, and darkness will chase his foes.
34:1:9/What are you plotting against the LORD? He will bring about total destruction; trouble will not strike twice.
34:1:10/Even though they are entangled like thorns, and drunk as if with wine, they will be consumed like dry stubble.
34:1:11/Someone from you has plotted evil against the LORD, a wicked advisor.
34:1:12/This is what the LORD says; Even if they are peaceful and numerous, they will still be cut down when he passes through. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
34:1:13/For now, I will break his yoke from you and tear your shackles apart.
34:1:14/And the LORD has issued a decree about you: Your name will no longer be spread. I will destroy the carved image and the cast idol from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.
34:1:15/Look, on the mountains, the feet of the one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! O Judah, celebrate your festivals, fulfill your vows: for the wicked will no longer pass through you; they are completely cut off.
34:2:1/The one who destroys has advanced before you: secure your fortress, be vigilant, strengthen your resolve, and greatly reinforce your strength.
34:2:2/For the LORD has removed the pride of Jacob, just as the pride of Israel, because the plunderers have completely looted them and ruined their vineyards.
34:2:3/The shields of his warriors are stained red, the heroes are dressed in scarlet: the chariots will blaze with fire on the day he prepares for battle, and the pine trees will be severely shaken.
34:2:4/The chariots will storm through the streets, crashing into each other in the open roads: they will blaze like torches, they will dart like lightning.
34:2:5/He will call upon his elite troops: they will stumble as they march; they will rush to its wall, and the defense will be set up.
34:2:6/The river gates will be flung open, and the palace will collapse.
34:2:7/And Huzzab will be taken prisoner, she will be led away, and her attendants will guide her, moaning like doves, beating on their chests.
34:2:8/But Nineveh has been like a water reservoir from days of old: yet they will run away. "Stand firm, stand firm," they will shout; but no one will turn back.
34:2:9/Seize the treasures of silver, seize the treasures of gold: for there is no end to the wealth and splendor from all its luxurious furnishings.
34:2:10/It is desolate, empty, and ruined: and hearts melt, knees knock together, agony is in every waist, and all faces turn pale.
34:2:11/Where is the lair of the lions, and the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion, the old lion, roamed, and the lion's cub, with no one to frighten them?
34:2:12/The lion tore enough for his cubs, killed for his lionesses, filled his lairs with prey, and his dens with the torn flesh.
34:2:13/Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions: and I will eliminate your prey from the earth, and the sound of your messengers will no longer be heard.
34:3:1/Doom to the city soaked in blood, filled to the brim with lies and theft, where the victims never stop coming.
34:3:2/The sound of the whip, the clatter of wheels, horses galloping, and chariots bouncing.
34:3:3/Cavalrymen brandish their shining swords and gleaming spears: a mass of casualties, countless dead bodies, they trip over their own dead.
34:3:4/Because of the countless harlotries of the seductive sorceress, who trades nations with her sexual immorality, and clans through her sorceries.
34:3:5/See, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts; I will lift your skirts over your face, I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your disgrace.
34:3:6/I will throw detestable filth on you, make you vile, and turn you into a spectacle.
34:3:7/It will happen that all who see you will run from you, saying, 'Nineveh is ruined: who will mourn for her?' Where can I find comforters for you?
34:3:8/Are you better than populous No, situated by the Nile, surrounded by water, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall made from the sea?
34:3:9/Ethiopia and Egypt were her limitless strength; Put and the Libyans were her allies.
34:3:10/Yet she was taken captive, she went into exile; her infants were smashed at every street corner, they cast lots for her nobles, and all her great men were bound in chains.
34:3:11/You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding; you too will seek refuge from the enemy.
34:3:12/All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first ripe figs: if shaken, they fall right into the eater's mouth.
34:3:13/See, your troops are like women among you; the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed your bars.
34:3:14/Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses; work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brick kiln.
34:3:15/There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down; it will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourself like the locust, multiply like the grasshopper.
34:3:16/You have increased your merchants more than the stars of heaven; the locust sheds its skin and flies away.
34:3:17/Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges on a cold day, but when the sun rises they fly away, and no one knows where they are.
34:3:18/Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles lie in the dust; your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.
34:3:19/There is no cure for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news about you clap their hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?
35:1:1/The message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision.
35:1:2/O LORD, how long must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you about violence, but you do not save?
35:1:3/Why do you make me witness wrongdoing and force me to look at trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.
35:1:4/Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
35:1:5/Look at the nations and watch, and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.
35:1:6/Indeed, I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own.
35:1:7/They are feared and dreaded; their own justice and authority originate with themselves.
35:1:8/Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour.
35:1:9/They all come intent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind, gathering prisoners like sand.
35:1:10/They mock kings and rulers are a laughingstock to them. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them.
35:1:11/Then they sweep past like the wind and go on—guilty people, whose own strength is their god.
35:1:12/Aren't you from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.
35:1:13/Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
35:1:14/You have made people like the fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.
35:1:15/The wicked pull all of them up with hooks, catch them in their net, gather them in their dragnet; and so they rejoice and are glad.
35:1:16/Therefore they offer sacrifices to their net and burn incense to their dragnet, for by their net they live in luxury and enjoy the choicest food.
35:1:17/Is it to keep on emptying their net and mercilessly killing nations without pity?
35:2:1/I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what I will reply when I am corrected.
35:2:2/And the LORD replied to me, "Write down the vision clearly on tablets, so that a runner can read it easily.
35:2:3/For the vision awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.
35:2:4/See, the one whose desires are not upright will fail, but the righteous will live by their faithfulness.
35:2:5/Indeed, because he is betrayed by wine, he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.
35:2:6/Won't all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, 'Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?'
35:2:7/Will not your creditors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their prey.
35:2:8/Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
35:2:9/Woe to him who unjustly gains wealth for his house to place his nest on high, to escape the reach of disaster!
35:2:10/You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples; you have sinned against yourself.
35:2:11/For the stones will cry out from the wall, and the beams from the woodwork will echo it.
35:2:12/Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by injustice!
35:2:13/Is it not indeed from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor only to feed the flames, and nations weary themselves for nothing?
35:2:14/For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
35:2:15/Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink, pouring out your wrath and even making them drunk, to gaze on their nakedness!
35:2:16/You will be filled with disgrace instead of honor. Now it is your turn! Drink and expose your uncircumcision! The cup from the LORD’s right hand will come around to you, and utter shame will cover your glory.
35:2:17/The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you, because of your bloodshed and violence to the land, to the city and all who live there.
35:2:18/What value is an idol carved by a craftsman, or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.
35:2:19/Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it at all.
35:2:20/But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.
35:3:1/A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
35:3:2/Lord, I have heard your message, and I was afraid: Lord, rejuvenate your work in the middle of the years, make it known; even in anger, remember to show mercy.
35:3:3/God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the skies, and the earth was filled with his praise.
35:3:4/His brightness was like the sunlight; he had rays flashing from his hand: and there his power was hidden.
35:3:5/Before him went disease, and fiery bolts shot out at his feet.
35:3:6/He stood and surveyed the earth: he looked, and made the nations tremble; the ancient mountains crumbled, the age-old hills bowed down: his ways are eternal.
35:3:7/I saw the tents of Cushan in distress; and the dwellings of the land of Midian did tremble.
35:3:8/Was the Lord angry with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers? Was your wrath against the sea, that you rode on your horses and your chariots of salvation?
35:3:9/Your bow was fully revealed, according to the promises to the tribes, even your word. Selah. You split the earth with rivers.
35:3:10/The mountains saw you and writhed: the torrent of water swept by: the deep voiced its roar, and lifted its hands on high.
35:3:11/The sun and moon stood still in their places: at the flash of your arrows they moved, and at the gleam of your glittering spear.
35:3:12/You marched through the land in wrath, you threshed the nations in anger.
35:3:13/You went out for the salvation of your people, for salvation with your anointed; you struck the head from the house of the wicked, laying bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.
35:3:14/You pierced with his own spears the heads of his warriors: they came like a whirlwind to scatter me, their joy was like feasting on the poor in secret.
35:3:15/You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.
35:3:16/When I heard, my stomach churned; my lips quivered at the sound: decay crept into my bones, and I trembled where I stood, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he comes up against the people, he will invade them with his troops.
35:3:17/Even though the fig tree does not bloom, and there are no grapes on the vines; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields produce no food; even though there are no sheep in the pen, and no cattle in the stalls:
35:3:18/Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.
35:3:19/The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like the deer's, and he will make me walk on my high places. To the chief musician with my stringed instruments.
36:1:1/The message from the LORD that came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, during the reign of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.
36:1:2/I will completely remove everything from the land, says the LORD.
36:1:3/I will eliminate humans and animals; I will wipe out the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea, along with the obstacles that lead the wicked astray: and I will erase humans from the land, says the LORD.
36:1:4/I will also extend my hand against Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem; and I will eliminate the remnants of Baal from this place, along with the names of the idolatrous priests;
36:1:5/And those who worship the celestial bodies on the rooftops; and those who worship and swear by the LORD, and also swear by Malcham;
36:1:6/And those who have turned away from the LORD; and those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of him.
36:1:7/Be silent before the Sovereign LORD: for the day of the LORD is near: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has invited his guests.
36:1:8/And on the day of the LORD’s sacrifice, I will punish the officials, the royal offspring, and all who wear foreign clothing.
36:1:9/On that day, I will also punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.
36:1:10/And on that day, says the LORD, there will be a cry from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
36:1:11/Wail, you residents of Maktesh, for all the trading people are destroyed; all who handle money are cut down.
36:1:12/And at that time, I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, those who think in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good, nor will he do harm.'
36:1:13/As a result, their possessions will be plundered, and their houses will be left in ruins. They will build houses but not live in them; they will plant vineyards but not drink their wine.
36:1:14/The great day of the LORD is near, it is near and coming quickly, the sound of the day of the LORD is bitter; the warrior cries out there.
36:1:15/That day is a day of anger, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
36:1:16/A day of the trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.
36:1:17/I will bring such distress on people that they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust, and their bodies like refuse.
36:1:18/Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD’s anger; but the whole land will be consumed by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make a sudden end of all who live in the land.
36:2:1/Come together, yes, come together, O nation not desired;
36:2:2/Before the decree takes effect, before the day fades like chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD falls upon you, before the day of the LORD's anger arrives.
36:2:3/Search for the LORD, all you humble of the earth, who have followed his commands; seek righteousness, seek humility: perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD's anger.
36:2:4/Gaza will be abandoned, and Ashkelon will become a wasteland: they will expel Ashdod at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.
36:2:5/Woe to the inhabitants of the coastal region, the nation of the Cherethites! The LORD's message is against you; O Canaan, land of the Philistines, I will surely destroy you, leaving no one behind.
36:2:6/And the coastal region will become pastures and huts for shepherds, and pens for flocks.
36:2:7/And the coast will belong to the survivors of the house of Judah; they will graze there: in the houses of Ashkelon they will rest at night: for the LORD their God will visit them, and reverse their fortune.
36:2:8/I have heard the insults of Moab, and the taunts of the Ammonites, who have belittled my people and boasted against their territory.
36:2:9/Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab will become like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a place of weeds and salt pits, and a perpetual wasteland: the survivors of my people will plunder them, and the remnant of my people will take possession.
36:2:10/This will be their fate for their arrogance, because they have insulted and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.
36:2:11/The LORD will be fearsome to them: for he will starve all the gods of the earth; and people will worship him, each from their own place, all the islands of the nations.
36:2:12/You Ethiopians, too, will fall by my sword.
36:2:13/And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will turn Nineveh into a wasteland, parched like a desert.
36:2:14/And flocks will lie down in the middle of her, all the animals of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern will nest in the upper lintels of it; their voices will sing in the windows; desolation will be at the thresholds; for he will strip bare the cedar work.
36:2:15/This is the jubilant city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is no one else: how has she become a wasteland, a place for beasts to rest! Everyone who passes by her will hiss and shake their head.
36:3:1/Woe to the city that is dirty and corrupt, to the city that oppresses its people!
36:3:2/She didn't listen to the voice; she didn't accept correction; she didn't trust in the LORD; she didn't draw close to her God.
36:3:3/Her leaders are like roaring lions; her judges are like wolves at night, not sparing anything until morning.
36:3:4/Her prophets are irresponsible and deceitful; her priests have defiled the sanctuary, they have violated the law.
36:3:5/The just LORD is in its midst; he will not act unjustly: every morning he makes his judgment known, he never fails; but the unjust feel no shame.
36:3:6/I have destroyed nations: their fortresses are deserted; I made their streets empty, with no one passing by: their cities are ruined, with no one living there.
36:3:7/I thought, surely you will fear me, you will accept correction; so your homes would not be destroyed, no matter how I punished you: but they got up early and corrupted all their actions.
36:3:8/So wait for me, says the LORD, until the day I stand up to take action: for my plan is to gather the nations, to bring together the kingdoms, to pour out on them my fury, all my burning anger: for the whole earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy.
36:3:9/For then I will give the people a pure language, so they can all call on the name of the LORD, to serve him unitedly.
36:3:10/From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my worshipers, the scattered people, will bring me offerings.
36:3:11/On that day you will not be ashamed of all your actions, in which you have rebelled against me: for then I will remove from your midst those who take pride in your pride, and you will no longer be arrogant on my holy mountain.
36:3:12/I will leave in your midst a humble and poor people, and they will trust in the name of the LORD.
36:3:13/The survivors in Israel will not commit sin, nor tell lies; a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths: for they will graze and lie down, with no one to make them afraid.
36:3:14/Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be joyful and rejoice with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
36:3:15/The LORD has removed your punishment, he has driven out your enemy: the king of Israel, the LORD, is among you: you will not see harm anymore.
36:3:16/On that day it will be said to Jerusalem, Do not fear: and to Zion, Do not let your hands hang down.
36:3:17/The LORD your God is with you, mighty to save; he will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.
36:3:18/I will gather those who mourn for the festival, who are from you, to whom its reproach was a burden.
36:3:19/See, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you: I will save the lame and gather those who were driven away; I will give them praise and honor in every land where they were shamed.
36:3:20/At that time I will bring you back, even at the time when I gather you: for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD.
37:1:1/In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
37:1:2/The LORD of hosts says, "This people claim it's not yet time to rebuild the LORD's house."
37:1:3/Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying,
37:1:4/"Is it time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses while this house remains a ruin?"
37:1:5/So now, this is what the LORD of hosts says: "Think carefully about your ways."
37:1:6/"You have planted much but harvest little; you eat but never have enough; you drink but never have your fill; you dress yourselves but no one is warm; and he who earns wages does so to put them into a purse with holes."
37:1:7/This is what the LORD of hosts says: "Think carefully about your ways."
37:1:8/"Go up to the mountains, bring back timber, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it and be honored," says the LORD.
37:1:9/"You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?" declares the LORD of hosts. "Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house."
37:1:10/"Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops."
37:1:11/"I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, and whatever the ground produces, on men and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands."
37:1:12/Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the message of Haggai the prophet, because the LORD their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the LORD.
37:1:13/Then Haggai, the LORD's messenger, delivered the LORD's message to the people, saying, "I am with you," declares the LORD.
37:1:14/And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
37:1:15/On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
37:2:1/On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai, saying,
37:2:2/Tell Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the rest of the people,
37:2:3/Who among you remembers this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Doesn't it seem like nothing in comparison?
37:2:4/But now, be strong, Zerubbabel, declares the LORD; be strong, Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land, declares the LORD, and work: for I am with you, declares the LORD of hosts.
37:2:5/Just as I promised when you came out of Egypt, my Spirit remains among you: do not fear.
37:2:6/For this is what the LORD of hosts says: In a little while, I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.
37:2:7/And I will shake all nations, and what all nations desire will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts.
37:2:8/The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the LORD of hosts.
37:2:9/The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place, I will grant peace, declares the LORD of hosts.
37:2:10/On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying,
37:2:11/This is what the LORD of hosts says; Ask the priests about the law:
37:2:12/If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy? The priests answered, No.
37:2:13/Then Haggai said, If someone who is unclean because of contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean? The priests answered, It becomes unclean.
37:2:14/Then Haggai responded, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, declares the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.
37:2:15/Now, give careful thought to this from this day on—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the LORD's temple.
37:2:16/Before that time, when one came to a pile of twenty measures, there were only ten; when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty.
37:2:17/I struck you with blight and mildew and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you did not turn to me, declares the LORD.
37:2:18/From this day on, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, give it careful thought.
37:2:19/Is there still seed in the barn? Until now, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not borne fruit. From this day on, I will bless you.
37:2:20/And again, the word of the LORD came to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
37:2:21/Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, I will shake the heavens and the earth.
37:2:22/And I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms; I will destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots and their riders; the horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.
37:2:23/On that day, declares the LORD of hosts, I will take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, declares the LORD, and make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the LORD of hosts.
38:1:1/In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
38:1:2/The LORD has been extremely displeased with your ancestors.
38:1:3/So tell them, 'This is what the LORD of hosts says: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
38:1:4/Don't be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed, 'This is what the LORD of hosts says: Turn away from your evil ways and your evil actions.' But they didn't listen or pay attention to me, says the LORD.
38:1:5/Where are your fathers now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
38:1:6/Yet my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, 'The LORD of hosts has dealt with us according to our ways and actions, just as he planned to do.'
38:1:7/On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Sebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
38:1:8/I saw in the night, and there was a man riding on a red horse, standing among the myrtle trees in the valley; and behind him were red, speckled, and white horses.
38:1:9/Then I asked, 'My lord, what are these?' And the angel who was speaking with me said, 'I will show you what these are.'
38:1:10/And the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, 'These are the ones whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.'
38:1:11/They reported to the angel of the LORD standing among the myrtle trees, 'We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is calm and at peace.'
38:1:12/Then the angel of the LORD responded, 'O LORD of hosts, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which you have been angry for seventy years?'
38:1:13/And the LORD replied to the angel who was speaking with me with kind and comforting words.
38:1:14/So the angel who was speaking with me said, 'Proclaim this: This is what the LORD of hosts says: I am very passionate about Jerusalem and Zion, with great passion.
38:1:15/And I am extremely displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was only a little displeased, but they added to the disaster.'
38:1:16/Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; my house will be rebuilt in it, says the LORD of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.'
38:1:17/Proclaim further: This is what the LORD of hosts says: 'My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.'
38:1:18/Then I looked up and saw four horns.
38:1:19/And I asked the angel who was speaking with me, 'What are these?' And he answered, 'These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.'
38:1:20/And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
38:1:21/Then I asked, 'What are these coming to do?' And he said, 'These are the horns that scattered Judah, so no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.'
38:2:1/I looked up again, and saw a man holding a measuring line.
38:2:2/Then I asked, "Where are you going?" And he replied, "To measure Jerusalem, to find out its width and its length."
38:2:3/And then, the angel who was speaking with me stepped forward, and another angel came out to meet him,
38:2:4/And told him, "Go, tell this young man, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited like villages without walls because of the vast number of people and animals in it.
38:2:5/For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire all around her, and I will be the glory within her.'
38:2:6/"Come, come! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven," declares the LORD.
38:2:7/"Escape, O Zion, you who live with the daughter of Babylon."
38:2:8/For this is what the LORD of hosts says: "After being glorified, He has sent me against the nations that plundered you; for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.
38:2:9/Behold, I will wave my hand over them, and they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.
38:2:10/"Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for I am coming, and I will live among you," declares the LORD.
38:2:11/And many nations will join themselves to the LORD on that day and will become my people. I will live among you, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
38:2:12/And the LORD will take Judah as His portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.
38:2:13/Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for He has awakened from His holy dwelling.
38:3:1/And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.
38:3:2/And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is this not someone rescued from the fire?"
38:3:3/Now Joshua was wearing dirty clothes and stood before the angel.
38:3:4/And he responded and spoke to those standing before him, saying, "Remove the dirty clothes from him." And to him he said, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will dress you in fine clothes."
38:3:5/And I said, "Let them place a clean turban on his head." So they placed a clean turban on his head and dressed him in clothes. And the angel of the LORD stood by.
38:3:6/And the angel of the LORD gave Joshua a solemn charge, saying,
38:3:7/"This is what the LORD of hosts says; If you follow my ways and keep my commands, then you will also govern my house and guard my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here."
38:3:8/"Listen now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your colleagues who sit before you: for you are symbols of things to come: for, behold, I am going to bring my servant, the BRANCH."
38:3:9/"For see the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone there will be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its inscription," says the LORD of hosts, "and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day."
38:3:10/"On that day," says the LORD of hosts, "you will invite each other to sit under the vine and fig tree."
38:4:1/The angel who was speaking with me returned and woke me up, like someone being awakened from sleep.
38:4:2/He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lights on it, with seven channels to the lights.
38:4:3/There are also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left."
38:4:4/So I responded to the angel speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38:4:5/The angel speaking with me replied, "Don't you know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
38:4:6/Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty.
38:4:7/'What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel, you will become level ground. And he will bring out the capstone to shouts of 'Grace, grace to it!'"
38:4:8/Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
38:4:9/"Zerubbabel's hands have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.
38:4:10/Who dares to belittle the day of small beginnings? They will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which range throughout the earth.)"
38:4:11/Then I asked him, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?"
38:4:12/Again I inquired, "What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?"
38:4:13/He replied, "Don't you know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
38:4:14/Then he said, "These are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth."
38:5:1/Then I turned, looked up, and saw a flying scroll.
38:5:2/He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a flying scroll; it's twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide."
38:5:3/He then told me, "This represents the curse that is spreading across the entire earth: anyone who steals will be eliminated on this side according to it; and anyone who lies will be eliminated on that side according to it."
38:5:4/"I will send it out," declares the LORD of hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who lies using my name: it will stay in the middle of his house and will destroy it, along with its wood and stones."
38:5:5/Then the angel who was speaking with me stepped forward and said, "Now, look up and see what is being sent out."
38:5:6/I asked, "What is it?" He replied, "This is a measuring basket that is being sent out." He also said, "This represents the sin of the entire earth."
38:5:7/And look, a lead cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket.
38:5:8/He said, "This is wickedness." He then threw her back into the basket and placed the lead cover over its opening.
38:5:9/Then I looked up and saw two women coming with the wind in their wings; they had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted the basket into the sky.
38:5:10/So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the basket?"
38:5:11/He replied, "To build it a house in the land of Shinar: it will be set up there on its own foundation."
38:6:1/I turned, looked up, and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains; and the mountains were made of brass.
38:6:2/The first chariot had red horses; and the second chariot had black horses;
38:6:3/In the third chariot were white horses; and in the fourth chariot were dappled and strong horses.
38:6:4/So I asked the angel speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38:6:5/The angel replied, "These are the four spirits of the heavens, sent out from standing before the Lord of the whole earth."
38:6:6/The black horses are heading north; the white horses follow them; and the dappled horses head south.
38:6:7/And the strong horses went out, eager to roam the earth. He commanded, "Go, roam the earth." So they roamed across the earth.
38:6:8/Then he called out to me, "Look, those heading north have brought peace to my spirit in the north country."
38:6:9/And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
38:6:10/"Take from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go today to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;
38:6:11/Then take silver and gold, create crowns, and place them on the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;
38:6:12/And tell him, 'This is what the LORD of hosts says: Here is the man called The BRANCH; he will emerge from his place and build the temple of the LORD.
38:6:13/He will build the temple of the LORD; he will receive honor, and will sit and rule on his throne. He will be a priest on his throne, and there will be harmony between the two roles.
38:6:14/And the crowns will be a memorial for Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah, in the temple of the LORD.
38:6:15/Those from far away will come and help build the temple of the LORD, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you faithfully obey the voice of the LORD your God.
38:7:1/In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chisleu.
38:7:2/When Sherezer, Regemmelech, and their companions were sent to pray before the LORD at the house of God,
38:7:3/And to ask the priests in the house of the LORD of hosts, and the prophets, "Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have been doing for so many years?"
38:7:4/Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
38:7:5/Tell all the people of the land and the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month for seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?
38:7:6/And when you ate and drank, wasn't it just for yourselves that you were eating and drinking?'
38:7:7/Shouldn't you listen to the words the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding cities were inhabited and prosperous, and the Negev and the Shephelah were populated?
38:7:8/And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
38:7:9/This is what the LORD of hosts says: 'Administer true justice, show mercy and compassion to one another,
38:7:10/Do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the foreigner, or the poor; and do not plot evil against each other in your hearts.'
38:7:11/But they refused to pay attention, shrugged off their shoulders, and blocked their ears from hearing.
38:7:12/Yes, they made their hearts as hard as diamond, so they could not hear the law and the messages that the LORD of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore, a great anger came from the LORD of hosts.
38:7:13/So it happened that just as he called and they did not listen, when they called, I did not listen, says the LORD of hosts.
38:7:14/But I scattered them with a tempest among all the nations they did not know. Thus the land was left desolate behind them, so that no one could come and go. This made the pleasant land desolate.
38:8:1/Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
38:8:2/The LORD of hosts says; I felt intense jealousy for Zion, a jealousy filled with great passion.
38:8:3/The LORD says; I have returned to Zion and will live in the heart of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem will be known as a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.
38:8:4/The LORD of hosts says; Elderly men and women will once again live in the streets of Jerusalem, each leaning on a cane because of their age.
38:8:5/And the city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing freely.
38:8:6/The LORD of hosts says; If this seems amazing to the surviving people of this time, should it not seem amazing to me as well? says the LORD of hosts.
38:8:7/The LORD of hosts says; Look, I will rescue my people from the lands of the east and from the lands of the west; 
38:8:8/And I will bring them back, and they will live in the heart of Jerusalem: they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
38:8:9/The LORD of hosts says; Be strong, all of you who are listening to these words from the prophets today, words that were spoken on the day the foundation of the LORD of hosts' temple was laid, signaling that the temple would be rebuilt.
38:8:10/For before these times, there was no pay for work, nor any earnings for animals; there was no peace for anyone coming or going because of the conflict: for I turned everyone against their neighbor.
38:8:11/But now, I will not treat the survivors of this people as I did before, says the LORD of hosts.
38:8:12/The crops will be abundant; the vines will produce their fruit, the ground will yield its harvest, and the skies will give their dew; and I will make the survivors of this people inherit these blessings.
38:8:13/And it will happen, just as you were once a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel; so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but be strong.
38:8:14/For this is what the LORD of hosts says; Just as I planned to bring disaster to you when your ancestors angered me, says the LORD of hosts, and I did not relent,
38:8:15/So now I have planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.
38:8:16/These are the things you must do; Speak the truth to each other; make true and peaceful judgments in your courts; 
38:8:17/And do not plot evil in your hearts against one another; and do not love false oaths: for all these are things that I despise, says the LORD.
38:8:18/And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 
38:8:19/The LORD of hosts says; The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become times of joy and gladness, and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.
38:8:20/The LORD of hosts says; It will happen that people and the inhabitants of many cities will come together; 
38:8:21/And the residents of one city will go to another, saying, Let's go at once to seek the LORD's favor, to pray before the LORD of hosts: I will go too.
38:8:22/Indeed, many peoples and powerful nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.
38:8:23/The LORD of hosts says; In those days, ten people from all languages and nations will grab hold of a Jewish person by the hem of their robe and say, We want to go with you because we have heard that God is with you.
38:9:1/The message from the LORD is heavy on the land of Hadrach, and Damascus will find its rest in it: when human eyes, including all the tribes of Israel, turn toward the LORD.
38:9:2/And Hamath will also be near it; Tyre, and Sidon, even though they are very wise.
38:9:3/And Tyre built herself a fortress and piled up silver like dust, and fine gold like the mud of the streets.
38:9:4/Watch, the LORD will throw her out, and strike her power in the sea; and she will be consumed by fire.
38:9:5/Ashkelon will see it and be afraid; Gaza will also see it and be deeply saddened, and Ekron; for what she hoped for will be disappointed; and the king will vanish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
38:9:6/And an illegitimate child will live in Ashdod, and I will eliminate the arrogance of the Philistines.
38:9:7/And I will remove the blood from his mouth, and the detestable things from between his teeth: but the one who remains, he will be for our God, and he will be like a leader in Judah, and Ekron like a Jebusite.
38:9:8/And I will camp around my house to protect it from the army, from those passing by, and from those returning: and no oppressor will pass through them anymore: for now I have seen with my own eyes.
38:9:9/Celebrate with great joy, O daughter of Zion; shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem: see, your King comes to you: he is righteous, and brings salvation; humble, and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38:9:10/And I will remove the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be removed: and he will proclaim peace to the nations: and his rule will extend from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
38:9:11/As for you also, through the blood of your covenant I have released your prisoners from the waterless pit.
38:9:12/Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope: even today I declare that I will restore to you double.
38:9:13/When I have prepared Judah as my bow, filled the bow with Ephraim, and stirred up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you like the sword of a mighty warrior.
38:9:14/And the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow will flash like lightning: and the LORD God will sound the trumpet, and march in the storm winds of the south.
38:9:15/The LORD of hosts will protect them; and they will consume and trample with sling stones; and they will drink and roar as if with wine; and they will be filled like bowls, drenched like the corners of the altar.
38:9:16/And the LORD their God will save them on that day as the flock of his people: for they will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.
38:9:17/For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.
38:10:1/Ask the LORD for rain when it's time for the spring rains; the LORD will send thunderclouds and give everyone rain showers for their fields.
38:10:2/For the idols have spoken nonsense, and the fortune-tellers have seen lies; they've told false dreams and offered empty comfort. So the people wandered like sheep, troubled because they had no leader.
38:10:3/I was furious with the leaders, and I punished the rebels: for the LORD of hosts has cared for his flock, the house of Judah, and made them like his majestic horse in battle.
38:10:4/From him came the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.
38:10:5/They will be like warriors, stomping their enemies in the mud of the streets in battle. They will fight because the LORD is with them, and those who ride horses will be put to shame.
38:10:6/And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had never rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.
38:10:7/The people of Ephraim will be like warriors, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Yes, their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.
38:10:8/I will signal for them and gather them in. I have redeemed them, and they will multiply as they once did.
38:10:9/And I will plant them among the peoples; they will remember me in distant lands; they and their children will survive and return.
38:10:10/I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt, and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them into the lands of Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be enough room for them.
38:10:11/He will pass through the sea of trouble, and strike down the waves of the sea. All the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will depart.
38:10:12/And I will strengthen them in the LORD, and they will walk in his name, declares the LORD.
38:11:1/Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that the fire may consume your cedars.
38:11:2/Cry out, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen; the mighty are ruined: cry out, O oaks of Bashan, for the dense forest has been cut down.
38:11:3/There's a sound of shepherds wailing, for their splendor is ruined: a sound of young lions roaring, for the lushness of the Jordan is destroyed.
38:11:4/This is what the LORD my God says; Take care of the flock destined for slaughter;
38:11:5/Those who own them kill them without feeling guilty: and those who sell them say, 'Praise the LORD, I am rich'; and their own shepherds have no pity on them.
38:11:6/For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land, declares the LORD. But I will hand everyone over to their neighbor and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue them from their hands.
38:11:7/And I will tend to the flock destined for slaughter, especially the oppressed of the flock. I took for myself two staffs; one I named Favor, and the other I named Union; and I tended the flock.
38:11:8/I also removed three shepherds in one month; I grew impatient with them, and they also detested me.
38:11:9/Then I said, I will not tend you. What is to die, let it die; what is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those left devour each other's flesh.
38:11:10/And I took my staff, Favor, and broke it, to annul my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
38:11:11/It was annulled on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the LORD.
38:11:12/And I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.
38:11:13/And the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter"—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD for the potter.
38:11:14/Then I broke my second staff, Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
38:11:15/And the LORD said to me, "Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
38:11:16/For behold, I am raising up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those being lost, nor seek the young, nor heal the injured, nor feed the healthy, but will eat the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.
38:11:17/Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! His arm will be completely withered, and his right eye utterly blinded.
38:12:1/The message from the LORD for Israel says the LORD, who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and creates the human spirit within.
38:12:2/Watch, I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes trembling for all the surrounding nations, when they lay siege against both Judah and Jerusalem.
38:12:3/On that day, I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all nations: anyone who tries to lift it will be severely injured, even if all the nations of the earth unite against it.
38:12:4/On that day, says the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness; I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah but will blind every horse of the attacking nations.
38:12:5/And the leaders of Judah will think to themselves, 'The people of Jerusalem are our strength because of the LORD Almighty, their God.'
38:12:6/On that day, I will make the leaders of Judah like a fiery furnace among the wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves; they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and the left, and Jerusalem will be inhabited again in its rightful place.
38:12:7/The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem's inhabitants may not surpass that of Judah.
38:12:8/On that day, the LORD will protect the people of Jerusalem; even the weakest among them will be like David, and the royal house will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them.
38:12:9/And it will happen on that day, I will aim to eliminate all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
38:12:10/I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication; they will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn.
38:12:11/On that day, there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38:12:12/And the land will grieve, each family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38:12:13/The family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38:12:14/All the remaining families, each family by itself, and their wives by themselves.
38:13:1/On that day, a source of cleansing will be opened for the house of David and the people of Jerusalem, to wash away sin and impurity.
38:13:2/And on that day, declares the LORD Almighty, I will erase the memory of idols from the land; they will be forgotten. I will also remove the false prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.
38:13:3/If anyone still prophesies, his own parents will tell him, 'You must die because you have lied in the name of the LORD.' When he prophesies, his own parents will fatally wound him.
38:13:4/On that day, every prophet will be ashamed of his prophetic vision and will no longer wear the hairy cloak to deceive people.
38:13:5/Instead, he will declare, 'I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; I've been taught to work the land since my youth.'
38:13:6/If someone asks him, 'What are these wounds on your hands?' he will answer, 'I received these wounds at the house of my friends.'
38:13:7/Rise up, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me, declares the LORD Almighty. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the weak.
38:13:8/And in the whole land, declares the LORD, two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it.
38:13:9/I will bring this third through the fire, refine them as silver is refined, and test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'They are my people,' and they will say, 'The LORD is our God.'
38:14:1/Listen, the day of the LORD is coming, and your loot will be divided right among you.
38:14:2/I will bring all nations against Jerusalem for battle; the city will be captured, homes looted, women assaulted; half of the city will be exiled, but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city.
38:14:3/Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle.
38:14:4/On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will split in two from east to west, forming a great valley; half of the mountain will move north and half south.
38:14:5/You will flee through my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azal. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
38:14:6/On that day, there will be neither full light nor complete darkness.
38:14:7/It will be a unique day, known only to the LORD, with no distinction between day and night. At twilight, there will be light.
38:14:8/On that day, living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea, in both summer and winter.
38:14:9/And the LORD will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one LORD, and his name the only name.
38:14:10/The whole land will become like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will rise and remain in its place, from Benjamin’s Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
38:14:11/People will live there, and there will no longer be a curse of complete destruction; Jerusalem will dwell securely.
38:14:12/This will be the plague with which the LORD strikes all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
38:14:13/On that day, a great panic from the LORD will fall on them. Everyone will seize the hand of another, and their hands will turn against each other.
38:14:14/Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—large amounts of gold, silver, and clothing.
38:14:15/A similar plague will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
38:14:16/Then everyone who survives from all the nations that attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
38:14:17/If any of the earth's families do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain for them.
38:14:18/If the family of Egypt does not go up and enter in, they will have no rain; they will receive the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
38:14:19/This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
38:14:20/On that day, HOLINESS TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the LORD’s house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.
38:14:21/Indeed, every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of them and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
39:1:1/The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
39:1:2/"I have shown you love," says the LORD. "Yet you ask, 'How have you loved us?' Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?" says the LORD. "Yet I chose Jacob,
39:1:3/And I rejected Esau, turning his mountains and inheritance into a wasteland for the desert dragons.
39:1:4/While Edom may say, 'We are beaten down, but we will rebuild the ruins,' the LORD of hosts says, 'They may build, but I will demolish; and they will be known as the territory of wickedness, and the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.'
39:1:5/You will see it with your own eyes and say, 'The LORD's greatness extends beyond the borders of Israel.'
39:1:6/A son honors his father, and a servant respects his master. If I am a father, where is my honor? If I am a master, where is my respect?" says the LORD of hosts to you, priests who scorn my name. Yet you ask, 'How have we scorned your name?'
39:1:7/By offering defiled food on my altar. And you ask, 'How have we defiled you?' By saying that the LORD's table is contemptible.
39:1:8/When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, isn't that wrong? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn't that wrong? Try offering them to your governor; would he be pleased with you or show you favor?" says the LORD of hosts.
39:1:9/"So now, plead with God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you?" says the LORD of hosts.
39:1:10/"Is there anyone among you who will shut the doors so that you do not light useless fires on my altar? I am not pleased with you," says the LORD of hosts, "and I will not accept an offering from your hands.
39:1:11/For from sunrise to sunset, my name will be great among the nations; and in every place incense and pure offerings will be made to my name, because my name will be great among the nations," says the LORD of hosts.
39:1:12/But you profane it by saying, 'The LORD's table is defiled, and its food is contemptible.'
39:1:13/You also say, 'What a burden!' and you disdain it," says the LORD of hosts. "When you bring injured, lame, or sick animals as an offering, should I accept them from your hands?" says the LORD.
39:1:14/"Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the LORD. For I am a great King," says the LORD of hosts, "and my name is to be feared among the nations.
39:2:1/And now, O priests, this command is for you.
39:2:2/If you won't listen, and if you won't take it to heart to honor my name, says the LORD of hosts, I will send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them because you do not take it to heart.
39:2:3/Look, I will spoil your offspring, and smear dung on your faces, the dung from your solemn feasts; and someone will take you away with it.
39:2:4/And you will realize that I have sent this command to you, so that my covenant with Levi may continue, says the LORD of hosts.
39:2:5/My covenant with him was one of life and peace; and I gave them to him out of respect and awe he had for me, and he was reverent before my name.
39:2:6/The law of truth was in his mouth, and wrongdoing was not found on his lips: he walked with me in peace and fairness, and turned many from sin.
39:2:7/For a priest's lips should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
39:2:8/But you have strayed from the path; you have caused many to stumble over the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts.
39:2:9/Therefore, I have also made you despised and lowly before all the people, because you have not followed my ways, but have shown favoritism in applying the law.
39:2:10/Don't we all have one father? Hasn't one God created us? Why do we betray each other, violating the covenant of our ancestors?
39:2:11/Judah has been unfaithful, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has desecrated the sacredness of the LORD which he loved, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
39:2:12/The LORD will cut off the man who does this, both the master and the scholar, from the tents of Jacob, and anyone who presents an offering to the LORD of hosts.
39:2:13/And yet again, you do this, covering the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and with crying out, so much that he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with goodwill from your hand.
39:2:14/Yet you ask, "Why?" Because the LORD has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have been unfaithful: yet she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.
39:2:15/And did he not make them one? Yet he had the spirit in abundance. And why one? That he might seek a godly offspring. Therefore, be careful in your spirit, and let no one be unfaithful to the wife of his youth.
39:2:16/For the LORD, the God of Israel, says that he hates divorce: for it covers one's garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So be careful in your spirit, and do not be unfaithful.
39:2:17/You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you ask, "How have we wearied him?" When you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of the LORD, and he delights in them," or, "Where is the God of justice?"
39:3:1/Look, I'm going to send my messenger, and he will clear the path before me. And the LORD, whom you are looking for, will suddenly come to his temple, the messenger of the covenant, whom you are excited about: look, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.
39:3:2/But who can endure the day of his arrival? And who can stand when he shows up? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like laundry bleach:
39:3:3/He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: he will purify the descendants of Levi, and refine them like gold and silver, so they can offer the LORD an offering in righteousness.
39:3:4/Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD, like in the days of old, and as in previous years.
39:3:5/And I will come close to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who lie under oath, and against those who exploit workers, widows, and orphans, and deny justice to foreigners, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.
39:3:6/For I am the LORD, I do not change; therefore, you descendants of Jacob are not destroyed.
39:3:7/From the time of your ancestors, you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you ask, 'How can we return?'
39:3:8/Can a person rob God? Yet you have robbed me. But you ask, 'How have we robbed you?' In tithes and offerings.
39:3:9/You are under a curse because you have robbed me, the whole nation of you.
39:3:10/Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so there is food in my house. Test me in this, says the LORD of hosts, and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.
39:3:11/And I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe, says the LORD of hosts.
39:3:12/And all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.
39:3:13/You have spoken arrogantly against me, says the LORD. Yet you ask, 'What have we said against you?'
39:3:14/You have said, 'It's pointless to serve God. What do we gain by keeping his requirements and walking mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
39:3:15/Now we call the arrogant blessed. Indeed, those who do evil prosper; even those who challenge God escape.'
39:3:16/Then those who revered the LORD spoke with each other, and the LORD listened and heard. A book of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the LORD and honored his name.
39:3:17/They will be mine, says the LORD of hosts, on the day when I act, they will be my treasured possession. I will spare them, just as a father spares his son who serves him.
39:3:18/Then you will return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.
39:4:1/For, look, the day is coming that will burn like an oven; and all the arrogant and everyone who acts wickedly will be like chaff: and the coming day will consume them, says the LORD of hosts, leaving them without root or branch.
39:4:2/But for you who respect my name, the Sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays; and you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves.
39:4:3/And you will trample the wicked; they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act, says the LORD of hosts.
39:4:4/Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel, including the decrees and laws.
39:4:5/Look, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the arrival of the great and terrible day of the LORD:
39:4:6/And he will reconcile the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I won't come and strike the land with total destruction.
40:1:1/The record of the ancestry of Jesus Christ, the descendant of David, the descendant of Abraham.
40:1:2/Abraham fathered Isaac; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers; 
40:1:3/And Judah fathered Perez and Zerah with Tamar; and Perez fathered Hezron; and Hezron fathered Ram; 
40:1:4/And Ram fathered Amminadab; and Amminadab fathered Nahshon; and Nahshon fathered Salmon; 
40:1:5/And Salmon fathered Boaz with Rahab; and Boaz fathered Obed with Ruth; and Obed fathered Jesse; 
40:1:6/And Jesse fathered King David; and King David fathered Solomon with her who had been Uriah’s wife; 
40:1:7/And Solomon fathered Rehoboam; and Rehoboam fathered Abijah; and Abijah fathered Asa; 
40:1:8/And Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram; and Jehoram fathered Uzziah; 
40:1:9/And Uzziah fathered Jotham; and Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah;
40:1:10/And Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; and Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah; 
40:1:11/And Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers, around the time they were deported to Babylon: 
40:1:12/And after the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel; and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel; 
40:1:13/And Zerubbabel fathered Abiud; and Abiud fathered Eliakim; and Eliakim fathered Azor; 
40:1:14/And Azor fathered Zadok; and Zadok fathered Achim; and Achim fathered Eliud; 
40:1:15/And Eliud fathered Eleazar; and Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob; 
40:1:16/And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
40:1:17/Therefore, all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.
40:1:18/Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened like this: When his mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
40:1:19/Then Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to expose her to public disgrace, planned to divorce her quietly.
40:1:20/But as he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
40:1:21/She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
40:1:22/All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
40:1:23/"Look, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel" (which means "God with us").
40:1:24/When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
40:1:25/But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he named him Jesus.
40:2:1/Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea during the reign of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
40:2:2/Asking, "Where is the one born King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
40:2:3/When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all of Jerusalem with him.
40:2:4/He called together all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
40:2:5/They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judaea, as the prophet has written,"
40:2:6/"And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel."
40:2:7/Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out exactly when the star had appeared.
40:2:8/He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child; and when you find him, let me know, so that I too may go and worship him."
40:2:9/After hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
40:2:10/When they saw the star, they were overjoyed beyond measure.
40:2:11/Upon entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
40:2:12/And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
40:2:13/After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
40:2:14/So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt,
40:2:15/And stayed there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."
40:2:16/Then Herod, when he realized he had been outwitted by the wise men, was furious, and he ordered the killing of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
40:2:17/This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:
40:2:18/"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."
40:2:19/But when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
40:2:20/Saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."
40:2:21/So he got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
40:2:22/But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,
40:2:23/And he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
40:3:1/In those days, John the Baptist arrived, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
40:3:2/And he proclaimed, "Change your ways: for the kingdom of heaven is near."
40:3:3/This is the one mentioned by the prophet Isaiah, who said, "A voice shouting in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
40:3:4/John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
40:3:5/People from Jerusalem, all of Judaea, and the entire region around the Jordan went out to him,
40:3:6/And were baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
40:3:7/But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to escape the coming wrath?"
40:3:8/"Therefore, produce actions that show you have changed your hearts and lives."
40:3:9/And don't think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you, God can create children for Abraham from these stones.
40:3:10/And now, the axe is already at the root of the trees. So, every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
40:3:11/I baptize you with water as a sign of repentance. But the one coming after me is more powerful than I, whose sandals I'm not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
40:3:12/He has his winnowing fork in hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with fire that never goes out.
40:3:13/Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
40:3:14/But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
40:3:15/But Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John agreed.
40:3:16/And when Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up from the water. Suddenly, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
40:3:17/And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
40:4:1/Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
40:4:2/After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was very hungry.
40:4:3/When the tempter approached him, he said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
40:4:4/But Jesus replied, "It is written, 'People do not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
40:4:5/Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the highest point of the temple,
40:4:6/And said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
40:4:7/Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
40:4:8/Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
40:4:9/And he said to him, "All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me."
40:4:10/Then Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
40:4:11/Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended to him.
40:4:12/When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee;
40:4:13/Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali,
40:4:14/To fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:
40:4:15/"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
40:4:16/The people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned."
40:4:17/From that time on, Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."
40:4:18/As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
40:4:19/He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people."
40:4:20/Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
40:4:21/Moving on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedee, repairing their nets. He called them.
40:4:22/And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
40:4:23/Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40:4:24/News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them.
40:4:25/Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan followed him.
40:5:1/Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
40:5:2/And he began to teach them, saying,
40:5:3/Happy are those who are spiritually poor, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
40:5:4/Happy are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
40:5:5/Happy are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
40:5:6/Happy are those who hunger and thirst for what is right, for they will be satisfied.
40:5:7/Happy are the compassionate, for they will receive compassion.
40:5:8/Happy are those with a clean heart, for they will see God.
40:5:9/Happy are those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God.
40:5:10/Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what is right, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
40:5:11/Happy are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
40:5:12/Be joyful and very glad, because your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
40:5:13/You are the salt of the earth, but if salt loses its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
40:5:14/You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
40:5:15/People don't light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
40:5:16/In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and give glory to your Father in heaven.
40:5:17/Don't think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
40:5:18/Truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
40:5:19/Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
40:5:20/For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
40:5:21/You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder,' and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
40:5:22/But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
40:5:23/So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
40:5:24/leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother or sister; then come and offer your gift.
40:5:25/Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
40:5:26/Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.
40:5:27/You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
40:5:28/But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40:5:29/If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
40:5:30/And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
40:5:31/It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'
40:5:32/But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
40:5:33/Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.'
40:5:34/But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne;
40:5:35/or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
40:5:36/And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
40:5:37/But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' Anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
40:5:38/You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'
40:5:39/But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
40:5:40/And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.
40:5:41/If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.
40:5:42/Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
40:5:43/You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
40:5:44/But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
40:5:45/so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
40:5:46/If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
40:5:47/And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?
40:5:48/Therefore, be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
40:6:1/Be careful not to do your acts of kindness in front of others, just to be seen by them. If you do, you won't receive any reward from your Father in heaven.
40:6:2/So when you give to those in need, don't announce it with fanfare like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be admired by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
40:6:3/But when you give to the needy, do it in such a way that even your closest hand doesn't know what you're doing.
40:6:4/Your giving should be done in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40:6:5/And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. I assure you, they have received their full reward.
40:6:6/But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40:6:7/When you pray, don't keep on babbling like pagans, who think they'll be heard because of their many words.
40:6:8/Don't be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
40:6:9/This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.
40:6:10/May your kingdom come, may your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
40:6:11/Give us today our daily bread.
40:6:12/And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
40:6:13/And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
40:6:14/If you forgive others when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40:6:15/But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
40:6:16/And when you fast, don't look miserable like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
40:6:17/But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
40:6:18/so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40:6:19/Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
40:6:20/But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
40:6:21/For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
40:6:22/The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
40:6:23/But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
40:6:24/No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate one and love the other, or you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
40:6:25/Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
40:6:26/Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
40:6:27/Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
40:6:28/And why worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.
40:6:29/Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
40:6:30/If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?
40:6:31/So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
40:6:32/For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
40:6:33/But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
40:6:34/Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
40:7:1/Do not judge, so that you won't be judged.
40:7:2/Because the way you judge others, you will be judged, and the measure you use, it will be used to measure you.
40:7:3/And why do you look at the small speck in your brother's eye, but don't notice the large plank in your own eye?
40:7:4/Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is a plank in your own eye?
40:7:5/You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
40:7:6/Do not give what is sacred to dogs, and do not throw your pearls to pigs, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
40:7:7/Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
40:7:8/For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
40:7:9/Which of you, if your child asks for bread, will give them a stone?
40:7:10/Or if they ask for a fish, will give them a snake?
40:7:11/If you, though you are imperfect, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
40:7:12/So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the law and the prophets.
40:7:13/Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
40:7:14/But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
40:7:15/Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
40:7:16/You will recognize them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
40:7:17/Likewise, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
40:7:18/A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
40:7:19/Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40:7:20/Therefore, by their fruits you will recognize them.
40:7:21/Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
40:7:22/Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'
40:7:23/Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'
40:7:24/Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
40:7:25/And the rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
40:7:26/But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
40:7:27/And the rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.
40:7:28/When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
40:7:29/Because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
40:8:1/When he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
40:8:2/And look, a leper approached and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
40:8:3/And Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said, "I am willing; be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
40:8:4/And Jesus told him, "Make sure you don't tell anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift Moses commanded as a witness to them."
40:8:5/When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading,
40:8:6/And said, "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."
40:8:7/And Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
40:8:8/The centurion replied, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to enter under my roof: but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
40:8:9/"For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; another to come, and he comes; and my servant to do this, and he does it."
40:8:10/When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following, "Truly, I tell you, I haven't found such great faith in anyone in Israel."
40:8:11/"And I tell you, many will come from the east and west and will dine with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
40:8:12/"But the children of the kingdom will be thrown into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40:8:13/And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; let it be done just as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment.
40:8:14/When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
40:8:15/He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and began to serve them.
40:8:16/When evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick,
40:8:17/So that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, "He himself took our weaknesses and carried our diseases."
40:8:18/Seeing large crowds around him, Jesus ordered to go to the other side of the lake.
40:8:19/And a certain scribe came and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
40:8:20/And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
40:8:21/Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
40:8:22/But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
40:8:23/When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
40:8:24/And suddenly, a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves, but he was sleeping.
40:8:25/His disciples came to him and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to die!"
40:8:26/He said to them, "Why are you so afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
40:8:27/The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!"
40:8:28/When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
40:8:29/And they shouted, "What do you want with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"
40:8:30/Some distance from them, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
40:8:31/So the demons begged him, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
40:8:32/He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water.
40:8:33/Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town, and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
40:8:34/Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
40:9:1/He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own town.
40:9:2/And look, they brought to him a man paralyzed, lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, cheer up; your sins are forgiven."
40:9:3/And look, some of the scribes thought to themselves, "This man is blaspheming."
40:9:4/Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
40:9:5/Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
40:9:6/But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," (then he said to the paralyzed man,) "Get up, take your bed, and go home."
40:9:7/And he got up and went to his home.
40:9:8/But when the crowds saw it, they were amazed and praised God for giving such authority to humans.
40:9:9/As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
40:9:10/While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
40:9:11/When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
40:9:12/But when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do.
40:9:13/Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
40:9:14/Then John's disciples came to him and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
40:9:15/Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
40:9:16/No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
40:9:17/Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."
40:9:18/While he was saying these things to them, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
40:9:19/And Jesus got up and followed him, and so did his disciples.
40:9:20/And look, a woman who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
40:9:21/For she thought to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
40:9:22/But Jesus turned around, and when he saw her, he said, "Daughter, take heart; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that moment.
40:9:23/When Jesus entered the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,
40:9:24/He said, "Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at him.
40:9:25/But when the crowd had been sent outside, he went in, took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
40:9:26/And news of this spread throughout all that region.
40:9:27/As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40:9:28/When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They replied, "Yes, Lord."
40:9:29/Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
40:9:30/And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure no one knows about this."
40:9:31/But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
40:9:32/As they were going out, people brought to him a man who was mute and demon-possessed.
40:9:33/And when the demon was driven out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
40:9:34/But the Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the prince of demons."
40:9:35/Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40:9:36/When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
40:9:37/Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
40:9:38/So pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."
40:10:1/When he called his twelve disciples to him, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out, and to heal every kind of sickness and every kind of disease.
40:10:2/The names of the twelve apostles are as follows: First, Simon, known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
40:10:3/Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, also known as Lebbaeus;
40:10:4/Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.
40:10:5/Jesus sent these twelve out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
40:10:6/Instead, go to the lost sheep of Israel.
40:10:7/As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'
40:10:8/Heal the sick, cleanse those with leprosy, raise the dead, drive out demons. You have received freely, so give freely.
40:10:9/Don't carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts,
40:10:10/no bag for the journey, or extra shirt, sandals, or a staff, for the worker deserves his keep.
40:10:11/Whenever you enter a town or village, find out who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave.
40:10:12/As you enter a home, greet it.
40:10:13/If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.
40:10:14/If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.
40:10:15/Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.
40:10:16/I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
40:10:17/But be on your guard against people; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.
40:10:18/You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a witness to them and the Gentiles.
40:10:19/But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,
40:10:20/for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
40:10:21/Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
40:10:22/You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40:10:23/When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
40:10:24/A student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above their master.
40:10:25/It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household!
40:10:26/So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.
40:10:27/What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
40:10:28/Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
40:10:29/Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.
40:10:30/And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
40:10:31/So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
40:10:32/Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
40:10:33/But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.
40:10:34/Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
40:10:35/For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
40:10:36/A man's enemies will be the members of his own household.
40:10:37/Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
40:10:38/Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
40:10:39/Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
40:10:40/Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
40:10:41/Whoever welcomes a prophet because they are a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person because they are a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.
40:10:42/And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because they are my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.
40:11:1/After Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left to teach and preach in their towns.
40:11:2/When John, who was in prison, heard about what Christ was doing, he sent two of his disciples,
40:11:3/And asked him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"
40:11:4/Jesus replied, "Go back and tell John about what you hear and see:
40:11:5/The blind can see, the lame can walk, lepers are healed, the deaf can hear, the dead are brought back to life, and the good news is being shared with the poor.
40:11:6/And blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."
40:11:7/As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
40:11:8/But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in royal palaces.
40:11:9/Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
40:11:10/This is the one about whom it is written, 'Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
40:11:11/Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40:11:12/From the time of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people have been seizing it.
40:11:13/For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
40:11:14/And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who was to come.
40:11:15/Anyone with ears to hear should listen.
40:11:16/But to what can I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others,
40:11:17/'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned, and you did not mourn.'
40:11:18/For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
40:11:19/The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.
40:11:20/Then he began to denounce the towns where most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent:
40:11:21/"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
40:11:22/But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
40:11:23/And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
40:11:24/But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
40:11:25/At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.
40:11:26/Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
40:11:27/All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
40:11:28/Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
40:11:29/Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
40:11:30/For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
40:12:1/At that time Jesus walked through the grain fields on the Sabbath; and his disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
40:12:2/But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
40:12:3/But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
40:12:4/How he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?
40:12:5/Or haven't you read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?
40:12:6/But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
40:12:7/If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
40:12:8/For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
40:12:9/And moving on from there, he went into their synagogue.
40:12:10/And there was a man with a shriveled hand. And they questioned Jesus, asking, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"—so they could accuse him.
40:12:11/And he said to them, "Which one of you, if you had a sheep and it fell into a pit on the Sabbath, wouldn't grab it and lift it out?
40:12:12/How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
40:12:13/Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other.
40:12:14/Then the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill him.
40:12:15/But Jesus knew this and withdrew from there. Large crowds followed him, and he healed them all,
40:12:16/And he warned them not to make him known.
40:12:17/This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah,
40:12:18/"Here is my servant, whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
40:12:19/He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.
40:12:20/A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, until he has brought justice through to victory.
40:12:21/And in his name the nations will put their hope."
40:12:22/Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.
40:12:23/All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
40:12:24/But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons."
40:12:25/Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
40:12:26/If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
40:12:27/And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
40:12:28/But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
40:12:29/Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
40:12:30/Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
40:12:31/Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
40:12:32/Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
40:12:33/Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
40:12:34/You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
40:12:35/A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in them, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in them.
40:12:36/But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
40:12:37/For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."
40:12:38/Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
40:12:39/But he answered and said to them, "An evil and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40:12:40/For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
40:12:41/The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here.
40:12:42/The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here.
40:12:43/When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
40:12:44/Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.
40:12:45/Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation."
40:12:46/While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
40:12:47/Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
40:12:48/But he replied to the one who told him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
40:12:49/And pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
40:12:50/For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother."
40:13:1/That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the seaside.
40:13:2/And large crowds gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd stood on the shore.
40:13:3/He told them many things using parables, saying, "Look, a farmer went out to plant seeds.
40:13:4/As he was scattering the seeds, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate them up.
40:13:5/Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much soil. They sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.
40:13:6/But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and since they had no root, they withered away.
40:13:7/Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
40:13:8/But some seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
40:13:9/Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
40:13:10/Then the disciples came and asked him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
40:13:11/He replied, "Because you are permitted to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but others are not.
40:13:12/To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
40:13:13/This is why I speak to them in parables: Though they see, they do not really see; though they hear, they do not really hear or understand.
40:13:14/In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
40:13:15/For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.'
40:13:16/But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
40:13:17/Truly, I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
40:13:18/Listen then to what the parable of the sower means.
40:13:19/When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
40:13:20/But the seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
40:13:21/Yet since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
40:13:22/The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
40:13:23/But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
40:13:24/He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40:13:25/But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
40:13:26/When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
40:13:27/The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'
40:13:28/He replied, 'An enemy did this.' The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'
40:13:29/'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.
40:13:30/Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"
40:13:31/He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
40:13:32/It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches."
40:13:33/He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."
40:13:34/Jesus told all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
40:13:35/So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."
40:13:36/Then Jesus sent the crowd away and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
40:13:37/He answered, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
40:13:38/The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,
40:13:39/and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.
40:13:40/Just as the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
40:13:41/The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
40:13:42/They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40:13:43/Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40:13:44/Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
40:13:45/Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
40:13:46/When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.
40:13:47/Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught all kinds of fish.
40:13:48/When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.
40:13:49/This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
40:13:50/and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40:13:51/Jesus asked them, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes, Lord."
40:13:52/He said to them, "Therefore, every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
40:13:53/When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
40:13:54/When he arrived in his hometown, he taught the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked.
40:13:55/"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
40:13:56/Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"
40:13:57/And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home."
40:13:58/And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
40:14:1/At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus' fame,
40:14:2/And said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; and that's why miraculous powers are at work in him."
40:14:3/For Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
40:14:4/For John had told him, "It's not right for you to have her."
40:14:5/And though he wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.
40:14:6/But during Herod's birthday celebration, the daughter of Herodias danced for them and pleased Herod.
40:14:7/So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
40:14:8/And she, prompted by her mother, said, "Give me John the Baptist's head on a platter."
40:14:9/And the king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted.
40:14:10/And he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
40:14:11/And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who brought it to her mother.
40:14:12/And John's disciples came, took his body, buried it, and then went and told Jesus.
40:14:13/When Jesus heard about it, he left there by boat to a secluded place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
40:14:14/And Jesus went out and saw a large crowd, felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.
40:14:15/When evening came, his disciples approached him, saying, "This is a remote place, and it's already late; send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
40:14:16/But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away; you give them something to eat."
40:14:17/They said to him, "We have only five loaves and two fish."
40:14:18/He said, "Bring them here to me."
40:14:19/Then he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
40:14:20/And everyone ate and was satisfied, and they picked up twelve baskets full of leftovers.
40:14:21/And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
40:14:22/Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
40:14:23/And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
40:14:24/But the boat was already far from land, battered by the waves because the wind was against it.
40:14:25/And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.
40:14:26/When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they screamed in fear.
40:14:27/But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage; it's me. Don't be afraid."
40:14:28/And Peter replied, "Lord, if it's you, tell me to come to you on the water."
40:14:29/He said, "Come." And Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.
40:14:30/But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
40:14:31/Immediately Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
40:14:32/And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
40:14:33/Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
40:14:34/And when they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.
40:14:35/And when the people of that place recognized him, they sent word throughout the region and brought all who were sick to him;
40:14:36/And they pleaded with him that they might just touch the hem of his garment. And all who touched it were completely healed.
40:15:1/Then scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem approached Jesus, asking,
40:15:2/"Why do your disciples ignore the traditions of the elders? They don't wash their hands before eating bread."
40:15:3/But he replied, "Why do you also ignore God's commandment because of your tradition?
40:15:4/"God commanded, 'Respect your father and mother,' and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death.'
40:15:5/But you say, 'If anyone tells their father or mother, "Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift,"
40:15:6/and doesn't honor their father or mother, they're off the hook.' This way, you nullify God's commandment for the sake of your tradition.
40:15:7/"You hypocrites, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying,
40:15:8/'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
40:15:9/But they worship me in vain, teaching human rules as doctrines.'"
40:15:10/Then he called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand:
40:15:11/It's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a person."
40:15:12/Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
40:15:13/But he replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father hasn't planted will be pulled up by the roots.
40:15:14/Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."
40:15:15/Then Peter said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
40:15:16/And Jesus said, "Are you still so dull?
40:15:17/Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?
40:15:18/But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile a person.
40:15:19/For from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
40:15:20/These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them."
40:15:21/Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
40:15:22/And a Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession."
40:15:23/But Jesus did not answer her a word. So his disciples came and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
40:15:24/He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."
40:15:25/But she came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
40:15:26/He replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."
40:15:27/She said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
40:15:28/Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment.
40:15:29/Then Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a mountainside and sat down.
40:15:30/Large crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.
40:15:31/So the people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
40:15:32/Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
40:15:33/His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"
40:15:34/Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven, and a few small fish."
40:15:35/He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
40:15:36/Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the people.
40:15:37/They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
40:15:38/The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
40:15:39/After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
40:16:1/The Pharisees and Sadducees came, trying to test him by asking for a sign from heaven.
40:16:2/He replied, "When it's evening, you say, 'It will be clear weather because the sky is red.'
40:16:3/And in the morning, you say, 'Today will be stormy because the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you can't interpret the signs of the times.
40:16:4/A wicked and unfaithful generation demands a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away.
40:16:5/When his disciples reached the other side, they realized they had forgotten to bring bread.
40:16:6/Jesus told them, "Be careful and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40:16:7/They discussed this among themselves and concluded, "It's because we didn't bring any bread."
40:16:8/Understanding their discussion, Jesus said, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?
40:16:9/Don't you understand yet? Remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
40:16:10/Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you collected?
40:16:11/How do you not understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40:16:12/Then they understood that he was not telling them to beware of the yeast used in bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40:16:13/When Jesus arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
40:16:14/They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
40:16:15/He asked them, "But who do you say I am?"
40:16:16/Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
40:16:17/Jesus responded, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
40:16:18/And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
40:16:19/I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
40:16:20/Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
40:16:21/From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
40:16:22/Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
40:16:23/But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
40:16:24/Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
40:16:25/For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
40:16:26/What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
40:16:27/For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
40:16:28/Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
40:17:1/And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves,
40:17:2/And he was transformed before them: his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
40:17:3/And suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
40:17:4/Then Peter spoke up and said to Jesus, "Lord, it's wonderful for us to be here: if you wish, let's make three shelters; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40:17:5/While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
40:17:6/When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground, terrified.
40:17:7/But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
40:17:8/And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.
40:17:9/As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you've seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
40:17:10/And his disciples asked him, "Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
40:17:11/Jesus replied, "Elijah indeed is coming first and will restore all things.
40:17:12/But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
40:17:13/Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.
40:17:14/When they approached the crowd, a man came up to him, knelt before him, and said,
40:17:15/"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and suffers terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
40:17:16/I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."
40:17:17/Then Jesus answered, "You unbelieving and twisted generation, how long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me."
40:17:18/And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed at that moment.
40:17:19/Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
40:17:20/He said to them, "Because of your lack of faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
40:17:21/However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
40:17:22/While staying in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
40:17:23/They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised again." And they were deeply saddened.
40:17:24/When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
40:17:25/He said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes? From their own children or from others?"
40:17:26/Peter answered, "From others." Jesus said to him, "Then the children are exempt.
40:17:27/However, so that we do not cause offense, go to the lake, throw out a line, and take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."
40:18:1/At the same time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40:18:2/And Jesus called a little child to him and placed the child among them.
40:18:3/And said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
40:18:4/Whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
40:18:5/And anyone who welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.
40:18:6/But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
40:18:7/Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!
40:18:8/So if your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
40:18:9/And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
40:18:10/Be careful not to look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
40:18:11/For the Son of Man came to save the lost.
40:18:12/What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
40:18:13/And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
40:18:14/In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.
40:18:15/If your brother or sister sins against you, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
40:18:16/But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'
40:18:17/If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
40:18:18/Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
40:18:19/Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
40:18:20/For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."
40:18:21/Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
40:18:22/Jesus answered, "I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy-seven times.
40:18:23/Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
40:18:24/As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him.
40:18:25/Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
40:18:26/The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.'
40:18:27/The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
40:18:28/But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded.
40:18:29/His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.'
40:18:30/But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.
40:18:31/When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.
40:18:32/Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
40:18:33/Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'
40:18:34/In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.
40:18:35/This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
40:19:1/After Jesus finished speaking, he left Galilee and went to the area of Judea across the Jordan River.
40:19:2/Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
40:19:3/The Pharisees also approached him, trying to test him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
40:19:4/He replied, "Haven't you read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female,
40:19:5/And stated, 'For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?
40:19:6/So, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."
40:19:7/They asked him, "Then why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"
40:19:8/He said to them, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts, but it wasn't like that from the beginning.
40:19:9/And I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
40:19:10/His disciples said to him, "If that's the situation between a husband and wife, it's better not to marry."
40:19:11/But he told them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, only those to whom it has been given.
40:19:12/For there are eunuchs who were born that way, others were made that way by people, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this should accept it."
40:19:13/Then people brought little children to him so he could lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples scolded them.
40:19:14/But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
40:19:15/He laid his hands on them and then left that place.
40:19:16/Someone came up to him and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
40:19:17/He replied, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
40:19:18/The man asked, "Which ones?" Jesus answered, "Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,
40:19:19/Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself."
40:19:20/The young man said to him, "I've kept all these. What do I still lack?"
40:19:21/Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
40:19:22/But when the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had many possessions.
40:19:23/Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly, I tell you, it's hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
40:19:24/And again I tell you, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
40:19:25/When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
40:19:26/But Jesus looked at them and said, "With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
40:19:27/Peter then said to him, "We've left everything to follow you. What will we get in return?"
40:19:28/Jesus replied, "Truly, I tell you, when everything is made new, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
40:19:29/And everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
40:19:30/But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
40:20:1/The kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
40:20:2/After agreeing to pay the workers a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
40:20:3/Then, around nine in the morning, he saw others standing around in the marketplace doing nothing,
40:20:4/And he told them, 'You also go work in the vineyard, and I'll pay you what's fair.' So they went.
40:20:5/He went out again around noon and three in the afternoon and did the same thing.
40:20:6/Finally, at about five in the afternoon, he went out and found others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?'
40:20:7/They answered, 'Because no one has hired us.' He told them, 'You go and work in the vineyard too, and you'll be paid fairly.'
40:20:8/So when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and going to the first.'
40:20:9/The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.
40:20:10/But when the first ones came, they expected to receive more. Yet they also received a denarius each.
40:20:11/When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner,
40:20:12/Saying, 'These last workers only worked one hour, and you've made them equal to us who worked through the heat of the day.'
40:20:13/But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I'm not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
40:20:14/Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.
40:20:15/Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I'm generous?'
40:20:16/So the last will be first, and the first will be last. Many are called, but few are chosen.
40:20:17/As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them,
40:20:18/'Look, we're going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death,
40:20:19/And will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. On the third day, he will be raised to life.'
40:20:20/Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and asking a favor of him.
40:20:21/He asked her, 'What do you want?' She said, 'Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.'
40:20:22/But Jesus answered, 'You don't know what you're asking. Can you drink the cup I'm going to drink?' 'We can,' they answered.
40:20:23/He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.'
40:20:24/When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
40:20:25/But Jesus called them together and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
40:20:26/It will not be so among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
40:20:27/And whoever wants to be first must be your slave—
40:20:28/Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'
40:20:29/As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
40:20:30/Two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, shouted, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
40:20:31/The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
40:20:32/Jesus stopped and called them. 'What do you want me to do for you?' he asked.
40:20:33/'Lord,' they answered, 'we want our sight.'
40:20:34/Jesus felt compassion for them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
40:21:1/As they approached Jerusalem and reached Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead,
40:21:2/Telling them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied up, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me.
40:21:3/If anyone questions you, say, 'The Lord needs them,' and they will send them right away."
40:21:4/This happened to fulfill what the prophet had said,
40:21:5/"Tell the people of Zion, 'Look, your King is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
40:21:6/The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them,
40:21:7/They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
40:21:8/A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
40:21:9/The crowds going ahead of him and those following shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
40:21:10/When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
40:21:11/And the crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
40:21:12/Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,
40:21:13/And declared to them, "It is written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers."
40:21:14/The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
40:21:15/But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant,
40:21:16/And asked him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" Jesus replied, "Yes, have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?"
40:21:17/Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
40:21:18/In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he felt hungry.
40:21:19/Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "Never again will you bear fruit!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
40:21:20/When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
40:21:21/Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
40:21:22/And whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe, you will receive."
40:21:23/When he entered the temple courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
40:21:24/Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40:21:25/Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
40:21:26/But if we say, 'Of human origin,' we're afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet."
40:21:27/So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40:21:28/"What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'
40:21:29/The son answered, 'I will not,' but later he changed his mind and went.
40:21:30/Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.
40:21:31/Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
40:21:32/For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
40:21:33/"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
40:21:34/When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
40:21:35/But the tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
40:21:36/Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.
40:21:37/Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.
40:21:38/But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.'
40:21:39/So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
40:21:40/"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"
40:21:41/They replied, "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
40:21:42/Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this is the Lord's doing, and it is amazing in our eyes'?
40:21:43/Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits.
40:21:44/And anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whoever it falls, it will crush them."
40:21:45/When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew he was talking about them.
40:21:46/But they looked for a way to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowd because the people regarded him as a prophet.
40:22:1/And Jesus answered and spoke to them again using parables, saying,
40:22:2/The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a wedding for his son,
40:22:3/And sent out his servants to invite those who had been invited to the wedding, but they refused to come.
40:22:4/Again, he sent out other servants, telling them to say to those invited, 'Look, I have prepared my banquet: my oxen and fattened livestock are butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'
40:22:5/But they ignored the invitation and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business,
40:22:6/And the rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
40:22:7/When the king heard about this, he was furious. He sent his armies to destroy those murderers and set their city on fire.
40:22:8/Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.
40:22:9/Go therefore to the main roads, and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.'
40:22:10/So the servants went out into the roads and gathered all the people they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
40:22:11/But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes,
40:22:12/And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless.
40:22:13/Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40:22:14/For many are invited, but few are chosen.
40:22:15/Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap him in what he said.
40:22:16/And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God truthfully, and you don't care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.
40:22:17/So tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?'
40:22:18/But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, 'Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
40:22:19/Show me the coin used for the tax.' And they brought him a denarius.
40:22:20/And he said to them, 'Whose image and inscription is this?'
40:22:21/They said to him, 'Caesar's.' Then he said to them, 'Therefore, give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.'
40:22:22/When they heard this, they were amazed, and leaving him, they went away.
40:22:23/That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question,
40:22:24/Saying, 'Teacher, Moses said, if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
40:22:25/Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.
40:22:26/In the same way, the second and third, down to the seventh.
40:22:27/Last of all, the woman died too.
40:22:28/So in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.'
40:22:29/Jesus answered them, 'You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God.
40:22:30/For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
40:22:31/But regarding the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read what was spoken to you by God, saying,
40:22:32/'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.'
40:22:33/And when the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
40:22:34/But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
40:22:35/Then one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him, saying,
40:22:36/'Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?'
40:22:37/Jesus said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
40:22:38/This is the first and greatest commandment.
40:22:39/And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
40:22:40/On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.'
40:22:41/While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
40:22:42/Saying, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They said to him, 'The son of David.'
40:22:43/He said to them, 'Then how does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
40:22:44/'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet"'?
40:22:45/If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?'
40:22:46/And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions.
40:23:1/Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
40:23:2/Saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees have taken Moses' place of authority.
40:23:3/So, whatever they tell you to follow, do it. But don't act like they do, because they say one thing and do another.
40:23:4/They tie up heavy, hard-to-carry burdens and put them on people's shoulders, but they themselves won't lift a finger to move them.
40:23:5/But they do all their deeds to be seen by others: they wear their religious symbols wide and their clothes long,
40:23:6/And love the best seats at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues,
40:23:7/And love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called 'Teacher, Teacher.'
40:23:8/But you shouldn't be called 'Teacher,' because you have one Instructor, and that's the Messiah, and you are all brothers and sisters.
40:23:9/And don't call anyone on earth 'Father,' because you have one Father, and he's in heaven.
40:23:10/Nor should you be called 'leaders,' for you have one Leader, the Messiah.
40:23:11/But the greatest among you should be your servant.
40:23:12/Whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted.
40:23:13/But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You don't go in yourselves, nor do you allow those trying to enter to go in.
40:23:14/Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore, you will receive a greater condemnation.
40:23:15/Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel over sea and land to make a single convert, and when you do, you make them twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
40:23:16/Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by their oath.'
40:23:17/You fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
40:23:18/And, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on it is bound by their oath.'
40:23:19/You fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
40:23:20/Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
40:23:21/And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
40:23:22/And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.
40:23:23/Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
40:23:24/You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
40:23:25/Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
40:23:26/You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
40:23:27/Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
40:23:28/In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
40:23:29/Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
40:23:30/And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
40:23:31/So you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
40:23:32/Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!
40:23:33/You snakes, you brood of vipers, how will you escape being condemned to hell?
40:23:34/Therefore, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
40:23:35/And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
40:23:36/Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.
40:23:37/Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
40:23:38/Look, your house is left to you desolate.
40:23:39/For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.'
40:24:1/Jesus left the temple, and as he was leaving, his disciples approached him to point out the temple buildings.
40:24:2/Jesus responded, "Do you see all these things? Truly, I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
40:24:3/While sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and asked, "When will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
40:24:4/Jesus replied, "Be careful that no one deceives you."
40:24:5/Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many.
40:24:6/You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but don't be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come.
40:24:7/Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40:24:8/All these are the beginning of birth pains.
40:24:9/Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
40:24:10/Many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other.
40:24:11/Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
40:24:12/Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,
40:24:13/but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40:24:14/This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
40:24:15/So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place—let the reader understand—
40:24:16/then those in Judea should flee to the mountains.
40:24:17/Anyone on the rooftop should not go down to take anything out of their house.
40:24:18/And anyone in the field should not go back to get their cloak.
40:24:19/How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
40:24:20/Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
40:24:21/For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
40:24:22/If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
40:24:23/If anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it.
40:24:24/For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
40:24:25/See, I have told you ahead of time.
40:24:26/So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
40:24:27/For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
40:24:28/Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
40:24:29/Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
40:24:30/Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.
40:24:31/He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
40:24:32/Learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
40:24:33/So also, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.
40:24:34/Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
40:24:35/Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
40:24:36/But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
40:24:37/As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40:24:38/For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;
40:24:39/and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40:24:40/Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
40:24:41/Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.
40:24:42/Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
40:24:43/But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.
40:24:44/So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
40:24:45/Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
40:24:46/It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
40:24:47/Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
40:24:48/But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,'
40:24:49/and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards,
40:24:50/the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.
40:24:51/He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40:25:1/Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.
40:25:2/And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
40:25:3/The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
40:25:4/But the wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.
40:25:5/While the groom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
40:25:6/At midnight, a shout went up: 'Look, the groom is coming; go out to meet him.'
40:25:7/Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready.
40:25:8/And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'
40:25:9/But the wise answered, 'No, there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'
40:25:10/But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the groom arrived. The ones who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut.
40:25:11/Later the others also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us.'
40:25:12/But he replied, 'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.'
40:25:13/Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.
40:25:14/For the kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a long journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.
40:25:15/To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
40:25:16/The one who had received the five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five more bags.
40:25:17/In the same way, the one with two bags of gold gained two more.
40:25:18/But the one who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.
40:25:19/After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
40:25:20/The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'
40:25:21/His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'
40:25:22/The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'
40:25:23/His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'
40:25:24/Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.'
40:25:25/So I was afraid and went and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'
40:25:26/His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?'
40:25:27/Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.'
40:25:28/'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.'
40:25:29/'For everyone who has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.'
40:25:30/'And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40:25:31/When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
40:25:32/All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
40:25:33/He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
40:25:34/Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'
40:25:35/For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,
40:25:36/I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'
40:25:37/Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
40:25:38/When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?'
40:25:39/When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'
40:25:40/The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'
40:25:41/Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
40:25:42/For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
40:25:43/I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'
40:25:44/They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?'
40:25:45/He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
40:25:46/And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
40:26:1/After Jesus finished all these teachings, he told his disciples,
40:26:2/"You know that in two days it's the Passover feast, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
40:26:3/Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people gathered at the palace of the high priest, named Caiaphas,
40:26:4/And they plotted to arrest Jesus in a sneaky way and kill him.
40:26:5/But they said, "Not during the festival, or there might be a riot among the people."
40:26:6/While Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper,
40:26:7/A woman came to him with a jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
40:26:8/But when his disciples saw this, they were upset, asking, "Why this waste?
40:26:9/"This perfume could have been sold for a lot and the money given to the poor."
40:26:10/Understanding their reaction, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
40:26:11/"You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
40:26:12/"By pouring this perfume on my body, she has prepared me for burial.
40:26:13/"Truly, I tell you, wherever this good news is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."
40:26:14/Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests,
40:26:15/And asked, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?" So they agreed to pay him thirty pieces of silver.
40:26:16/From that moment, he looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
40:26:17/On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
40:26:18/He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"
40:26:19/So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
40:26:20/When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the twelve.
40:26:21/And while they were eating, he said, "Truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me."
40:26:22/They were deeply distressed and began to say to him one after another, "Surely not I, Lord?"
40:26:23/He replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
40:26:24/"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
40:26:25/Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
40:26:26/While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
40:26:27/Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
40:26:28/"For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
40:26:29/"But I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until the day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
40:26:30/After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
40:26:31/Then Jesus said to them, "Tonight, all of you will fall away because of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
40:26:32/"But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
40:26:33/Peter replied, "Even if everyone else falls away because of you, I never will."
40:26:34/Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
40:26:35/But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same.
40:26:36/Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
40:26:37/He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
40:26:38/Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
40:26:39/Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
40:26:40/He returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?
40:26:41/"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
40:26:42/He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."
40:26:43/He came back and found them sleeping again, because their eyes were heavy.
40:26:44/So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
40:26:45/Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
40:26:46/"Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
40:26:47/While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
40:26:48/The betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."
40:26:49/Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
40:26:50/Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
40:26:51/At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
40:26:52/Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
40:26:53/"Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
40:26:54/"But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"
40:26:55/At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
40:26:56/"But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
40:26:57/Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
40:26:58/But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
40:26:59/The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so they could put him to death,
40:26:60/But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward
40:26:61/And declared, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
40:26:62/The high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
40:26:63/But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
40:26:64/Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I say to all of you: From now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
40:26:65/Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
40:26:66/"What do you think?" They answered, "He deserves to die."
40:26:67/Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
40:26:68/And said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?"
40:26:69/While Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
40:26:70/But he denied it before everyone, saying, "I don't know what you're talking about."
40:26:71/When he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
40:26:72/He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man."
40:26:73/After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
40:26:74/Then he began to curse and swear, "I don't know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
40:26:75/And Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
40:27:1/At dawn, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to have him executed.
40:27:2/After they had tied him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
40:27:3/Then Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
40:27:4/Saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What's that to us? That's your problem."
40:27:5/So he threw the silver coins into the temple, left, and went away and hanged himself.
40:27:6/The chief priests picked up the silver coins and said, "It's not lawful to put this into the treasury, since it's blood money."
40:27:7/So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.
40:27:8/That's why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
40:27:9/This fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
40:27:10/And they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."
40:27:11/Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said so."
40:27:12/But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.
40:27:13/Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?"
40:27:14/But Jesus didn't respond at all, which amazed the governor greatly.
40:27:15/At the festival, the governor used to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choice.
40:27:16/At that time, they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
40:27:17/So when they had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Who do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
40:27:18/He knew they had handed Jesus over out of jealousy.
40:27:19/While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a lot today in a dream because of him."
40:27:20/But the chief priests and elders convinced the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
40:27:21/The governor asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas."
40:27:22/Pilate asked them, "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
40:27:23/The governor asked, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
40:27:24/Seeing that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting, Pilate took water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood. It's your responsibility."
40:27:25/All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
40:27:26/Then he released Barabbas to them. After having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.
40:27:27/Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
40:27:28/They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
40:27:29/After twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
40:27:30/They spat on him, took the reed, and struck him on the head.
40:27:31/After mocking him, they took off the robe, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
40:27:32/As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry Jesus' cross.
40:27:33/When they reached a place called Golgotha, which means Place of the Skull,
40:27:34/They offered him wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
40:27:35/After crucifying him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots,
40:27:36/And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
40:27:37/Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
40:27:38/Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
40:27:39/Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
40:27:40/And saying, "You who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
40:27:41/In the same way, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
40:27:42/"He saved others, but he can't save himself. If he's the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we'll believe in him.
40:27:43/He trusts in God; let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
40:27:44/Even the rebels who were crucified with him taunted him in the same way.
40:27:45/From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over all the land.
40:27:46/About three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"
40:27:47/When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling for Elijah."
40:27:48/Immediately one of them ran, got a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
40:27:49/The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
40:27:50/Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
40:27:51/At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split,
40:27:52/And tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
40:27:53/They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
40:27:54/When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
40:27:55/Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
40:27:56/Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
40:27:57/As evening approached, a wealthy man from Arimathea named Joseph, who had also become a disciple of Jesus,
40:27:58/Went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
40:27:59/Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
40:27:60/And placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He then rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and left.
40:27:61/Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
40:27:62/The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate,
40:27:63/Saying, "Sir, we remember that deceiver said while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise again.'"
40:27:64/So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples might come and steal the body and tell the people he has been raised from the dead. This last deception would be worse than the first."
40:27:65/Pilate told them, "You have a guard; go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."
40:27:66/So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.
40:28:1/At the end of the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to visit the tomb.
40:28:2/Suddenly, there was a great earthquake because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came, rolled back the stone, and sat on it.
40:28:3/His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
40:28:4/The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
40:28:5/The angel said to the women, "Don't be afraid. I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
40:28:6/He's not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.
40:28:7/Now go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. He's going ahead of you into Galilee; you will see him there. Remember, I have told you."
40:28:8/They left the tomb quickly, filled with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
40:28:9/As they went to tell the disciples, Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
40:28:10/Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there."
40:28:11/While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
40:28:12/After the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
40:28:13/telling them, "You must say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'
40:28:14/If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."
40:28:15/So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
40:28:16/Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
40:28:17/When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
40:28:18/Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
40:28:19/Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
40:28:20/teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely, I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
41:1:1/The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
41:1:2/As it is written in the prophets, "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
41:1:3/"A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
41:1:4/John was baptizing in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41:1:5/People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
41:1:6/John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
41:1:7/He preached, saying, "After me comes one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to bend down and untie.
41:1:8/I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41:1:9/At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
41:1:10/Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
41:1:11/And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
41:1:12/Immediately the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness.
41:1:13/And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.
41:1:14/After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
41:1:15/"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!"
41:1:16/As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
41:1:17/Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people."
41:1:18/At once they left their nets and followed him.
41:1:19/Going a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.
41:1:20/Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
41:1:21/They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
41:1:22/The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
41:1:23/Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,
41:1:24/"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
41:1:25/Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
41:1:26/And the impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
41:1:27/Everyone was so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."
41:1:28/News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
41:1:29/As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
41:1:30/Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.
41:1:31/So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
41:1:32/That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.
41:1:33/The whole town gathered at the door.
41:1:34/And he healed many who had various diseases, and drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
41:1:35/Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
41:1:36/Simon and his companions went to look for him,
41:1:37/and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"
41:1:38/He replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
41:1:39/So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
41:1:40/A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
41:1:41/Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"
41:1:42/Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
41:1:43/Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:
41:1:44/"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
41:1:45/But the man went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet people still came to him from everywhere.
41:2:1/And again he entered into Capernaum after a few days; and word spread that he was in the house.
41:2:2/And immediately, many people gathered, so much so that there was no space left, not even near the door; and he shared his teachings with them.
41:2:3/They came to him, bringing a man paralyzed, carried by four of them.
41:2:4/And when they couldn't get close to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and after making an opening, they lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
41:2:5/Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
41:2:6/But some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their minds,
41:2:7/"Why does this man speak like this? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
41:2:8/Immediately, Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they were thinking this, said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
41:2:9/"Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
41:2:10/"But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." He said to the paralyzed man,
41:2:11/"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
41:2:12/And immediately the man got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
41:2:13/Then he went out again by the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
41:2:14/As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
41:2:15/While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
41:2:16/When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
41:2:17/On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
41:2:18/John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but yours do not?"
41:2:19/Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
41:2:20/"But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast."
41:2:21/"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
41:2:22/"And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins."
41:2:23/One Sabbath, he was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
41:2:24/The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
41:2:25/He answered, "Haven't you ever read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
41:2:26/"How he entered the house of God during the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat, and also gave some to his companions?"
41:2:27/Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
41:2:28/"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
41:3:1/He entered the synagogue again, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
41:3:2/They watched him closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, hoping to find a reason to accuse him.
41:3:3/He said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
41:3:4/Then he asked them, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?" But they remained silent.
41:3:5/Looking around at them with anger, saddened by the stubbornness of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.
41:3:6/The Pharisees left and immediately started plotting with the Herodians on how they could kill him.
41:3:7/But Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,
41:3:8/And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon. When they heard about the amazing things he was doing, a large crowd came to him.
41:3:9/He told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him to avoid being crushed by the crowd.
41:3:10/For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.
41:3:11/And whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, "You are the Son of God."
41:3:12/But he sternly warned them not to reveal who he was.
41:3:13/He went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
41:3:14/He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he could send them out to preach,
41:3:15/And to have authority to heal sicknesses and to drive out demons.
41:3:16/And Simon he named Peter;
41:3:17/James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James; he named them Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder";
41:3:18/And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
41:3:19/And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Then they went into a house.
41:3:20/Again, a crowd gathered so large that they couldn't even eat.
41:3:21/When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
41:3:22/And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
41:3:23/He called them over and spoke to them in parables, "How can Satan drive out Satan?
41:3:24/If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
41:3:25/And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
41:3:26/If Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
41:3:27/No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.
41:3:28/Truly I tell you, all sins will be forgiven for the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;
41:3:29/But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin."
41:3:30/This was because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."
41:3:31/Then his mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
41:3:32/A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Look, your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."
41:3:33/He replied, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
41:3:34/Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
41:3:35/For whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."
41:4:1/He started teaching again by the seaside, and a huge crowd gathered around him. So much so, that he got into a boat and sat in the water while the entire crowd stood on the shore.
41:4:2/He taught them many things using stories, and began his lesson by saying,
41:4:3/"Listen up; imagine a farmer went out to plant some seeds.
41:4:4/As he scattered the seeds, some fell on the path, and birds came and ate them up.
41:4:5/Some seeds fell on rocky places where there wasn't much soil. They sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.
41:4:6/But when the sun came up, they were scorched, and since they didn't have deep roots, they withered away.
41:4:7/Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so they didn't produce any grain.
41:4:8/But some seeds fell on fertile soil, and they grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."
41:4:9/Then he added, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
41:4:10/When he was alone, those around him, along with the twelve disciples, asked him about the parable.
41:4:11/He told them, "You've been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of God. But for those outside, everything is said in parables,
41:4:12/so that 'they may be seeing but not perceiving, and hearing but not understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven.'"
41:4:13/Then he said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
41:4:14/The farmer plants the word.
41:4:15/Some people are like the seed along the path where the word is sown; as soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was planted in them.
41:4:16/And others are like the seed sown on rocky places; they hear the word and immediately receive it with joy.
41:4:17/But they have no root and last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
41:4:18/Still others are like the seed sown among thorns; they hear the word,
41:4:19/but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
41:4:20/And others are like the seed sown on good soil; they hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown."
41:4:21/He also said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it to be placed on a stand?
41:4:22/For nothing is hidden except to be made visible; nothing is secret except to come to light.
41:4:23/If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear."
41:4:24/Then he said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and even more will be added to you.
41:4:25/For whoever has will be given more; and whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."
41:4:26/He also said, "This is what the Kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.
41:4:27/Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
41:4:28/All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.
41:4:29/As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."
41:4:30/He continued, "What shall we say the Kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?
41:4:31/It's like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.
41:4:32/Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade."
41:4:33/With many similar parables, he shared the word with them, as much as they could understand.
41:4:34/He did not speak to them without using a parable. But privately, he explained everything to his disciples.
41:4:35/That day, when evening came, he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side."
41:4:36/After sending the crowd away, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.
41:4:37/A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.
41:4:38/He was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
41:4:39/He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Silence! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
41:4:40/He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41:4:41/They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"
41:5:1/They arrived at the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gadarenes.
41:5:2/As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came out of the tombs to meet him.
41:5:3/This man lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him, not even with chains.
41:5:4/He had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
41:5:5/Day and night he wandered among the tombs and in the hills, screaming and cutting himself with stones.
41:5:6/But when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him.
41:5:7/He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name, don't torture me!"
41:5:8/For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you impure spirit!"
41:5:9/Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."
41:5:10/And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
41:5:11/A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
41:5:12/The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."
41:5:13/He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned.
41:5:14/Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
41:5:15/When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
41:5:16/Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.
41:5:17/Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
41:5:18/As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
41:5:19/Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
41:5:20/So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
41:5:21/When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
41:5:22/Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.
41:5:23/He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."
41:5:24/So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.
41:5:25/And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
41:5:26/She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
41:5:27/When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
41:5:28/because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
41:5:29/Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
41:5:30/At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
41:5:31/His disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing against you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"
41:5:32/But he kept looking around to see who had done it.
41:5:33/Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
41:5:34/He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."
41:5:35/While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"
41:5:36/Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, "Don't be afraid; just believe."
41:5:37/He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.
41:5:38/When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.
41:5:39/He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."
41:5:40/They laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.
41:5:41/He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").
41:5:42/Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.
41:5:43/He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
41:6:1/He left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
41:6:2/When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, "Where did this man get these ideas? And how does he perform such remarkable miracles?
41:6:3/Isn't this the carpenter, Mary's son, and the brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters living here among us?" They were deeply offended by him.
41:6:4/But Jesus told them, "A prophet is respected everywhere except in his own hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household."
41:6:5/He couldn't perform any significant miracles there, except for healing a few sick people by laying his hands on them.
41:6:6/He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then he went around teaching in the nearby villages.
41:6:7/He called the twelve disciples to him and started sending them out two by two, giving them authority over evil spirits.
41:6:8/He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick—no food, no traveler's bag, no money in their belts.
41:6:9/He told them to wear sandals but not to wear two shirts.
41:6:10/He also said, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.
41:6:11/If any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet as you leave, as a warning to them. Truly, I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town."
41:6:12/So they went out and preached that people should change their hearts and lives.
41:6:13/They drove out many demons, anointed many sick people with oil, and healed them.
41:6:14/King Herod heard about Jesus, for his name had become well known. He said, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that's why miraculous powers are at work in him."
41:6:15/Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."
41:6:16/But when Herod heard about it, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"
41:6:17/For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.
41:6:18/John had been telling Herod, "It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41:6:19/So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was unable to do so,
41:6:20/because Herod feared John, knowing he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When he listened to him, he was greatly perplexed; yet he liked to listen to him.
41:6:21/Finally, the opportune time came. On his birthday, Herod gave a banquet for his high officials, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.
41:6:22/When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."
41:6:23/He promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask, I will give you, up to half my kingdom."
41:6:24/She went out and said to her mother, "What should I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.
41:6:25/At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
41:6:26/The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.
41:6:27/Immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,
41:6:28/and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
41:6:29/When John's disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
41:6:30/The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
41:6:31/Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."
41:6:32/So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
41:6:33/But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
41:6:34/When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
41:6:35/By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.
41:6:36/Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
41:6:37/But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take more than half a year's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"
41:6:38/"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five, and two fish."
41:6:39/Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
41:6:40/So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
41:6:41/Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
41:6:42/Everyone ate and was satisfied.
41:6:43/Afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fish.
41:6:44/The number of men who had eaten was about five thousand.
41:6:45/Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
41:6:46/After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
41:6:47/Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.
41:6:48/He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn, he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,
41:6:49/but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,
41:6:50/because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It's me. Don't be afraid."
41:6:51/Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,
41:6:52/for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
41:6:53/When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
41:6:54/As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.
41:6:55/They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
41:6:56/And wherever he went—into villages, towns, or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
41:7:1/Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.
41:7:2/And they noticed some of his disciples eating bread with hands that were not washed, which they considered unclean.
41:7:3/For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands, adhering to the tradition of the elders.
41:7:4/And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions they observe, such as the washing of cups, pots, bronze kettles, and dining tables.
41:7:5/Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of the elders and eat their bread with unwashed hands?"
41:7:6/He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.'
41:7:7/However, they worship me in vain, teaching human rules as doctrines."
41:7:8/You disregard God's commandment but cling to human traditions, like the washing of pots and cups; and you do many other similar things."
41:7:9/And he said to them, "You skillfully set aside God's command to keep your own tradition.
41:7:10/For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death.'
41:7:11/But you say, 'If anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, dedicated to God),'
41:7:12/then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.
41:7:13/Thus, you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."
41:7:14/And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand:
41:7:15/Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them."
41:7:16/If anyone has ears to hear, let them listen."
41:7:17/And when he had entered the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.
41:7:18/He said to them, "Are you also lacking in understanding? Don't you see that whatever enters a person from outside cannot defile them,
41:7:19/because it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body?" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)
41:7:20/He went on: "What comes out of a person is what defiles them.
41:7:21/For from within, out of people's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder,
41:7:22/adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.
41:7:23/All these evils come from inside and defile a person."
41:7:24/Then he left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.
41:7:25/Immediately a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.
41:7:26/The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
41:7:27/But Jesus told her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."
41:7:28/She replied, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
41:7:29/Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."
41:7:30/When she went home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
41:7:31/Leaving the region of Tyre and Sidon, he went to the Sea of Galilee, in the middle of the region of the Decapolis.
41:7:32/They brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.
41:7:33/Jesus took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers into the man's ears, spit, and touched his tongue.
41:7:34/Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," which means "Be opened."
41:7:35/Immediately the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak clearly.
41:7:36/Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more widely they spread the news.
41:7:37/People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
41:8:1/In those days, with a very large crowd and nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
41:8:2/I feel compassion for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.
41:8:3/And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will collapse on the way; some of them have come from a long distance.
41:8:4/And his disciples responded, "How can anyone feed these people with bread in this remote place?"
41:8:5/He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven."
41:8:6/He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute; and they handed them out to the crowd.
41:8:7/They also had a few small fish. He blessed them and ordered that these too be distributed.
41:8:8/So they ate and were satisfied, and they collected seven baskets of leftover pieces.
41:8:9/About four thousand people ate, and then he sent them away.
41:8:10/Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
41:8:11/The Pharisees came out and started to argue with him, demanding a sign from heaven to test him.
41:8:12/He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."
41:8:13/Then he left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other side.
41:8:14/Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
41:8:15/He cautioned them, "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
41:8:16/And they discussed among themselves that it was because they had no bread.
41:8:17/When Jesus knew this, he said to them, "Why are you discussing the fact you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
41:8:18/Though you have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
41:8:19/When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of leftovers did you pick up?" They said to him, "Twelve."
41:8:20/"And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of leftovers did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."
41:8:21/He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"
41:8:22/They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man to him, begging him to touch him.
41:8:23/He took the blind man by the hand, led him out of the village, spit on his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked, "Do you see anything?"
41:8:24/He looked up and said, "I see people, but they look like trees walking."
41:8:25/Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again. The man looked intently, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
41:8:26/He sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village or tell anyone in the village."
41:8:27/Jesus and his disciples went to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say I am?"
41:8:28/They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
41:8:29/He asked them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Messiah."
41:8:30/He strictly warned them not to tell anyone about him.
41:8:31/He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, be killed, and after three days rise again.
41:8:32/He spoke plainly about this. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
41:8:33/But Jesus turned, looked at his disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
41:8:34/Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
41:8:35/For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake and the gospel will save it.
41:8:36/What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
41:8:37/Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
41:8:38/If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels.
41:9:1/He told them, "I assure you, some of you standing here won't experience death before they see God's kingdom arrive with power."
41:9:2/Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain, where they were alone. There, he was transformed in front of them.
41:9:3/His clothes became dazzlingly white, whiter than any bleach on earth could make them.
41:9:4/Elijah and Moses appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
41:9:5/Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it's wonderful for us to be here. Let's make three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41:9:6/He didn't know what to say because they were all terrified.
41:9:7/A cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."
41:9:8/Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
41:9:9/As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
41:9:10/They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.
41:9:11/They questioned him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
41:9:12/He replied, "Elijah does indeed come first to restore all things. And how is it written about the Son of Man? That he must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt.
41:9:13/But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, just as it is written about him."
41:9:14/When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, with teachers of the law arguing with them.
41:9:15/Immediately, when the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe and ran to greet him.
41:9:16/He asked the teachers of the law, "What are you arguing with them about?"
41:9:17/Someone from the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
41:9:18/Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they couldn't."
41:9:19/He replied, "You unbelieving generation, how long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
41:9:20/So they brought the boy to him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
41:9:21/Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered.
41:9:22/"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."
41:9:23/"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for one who believes."
41:9:24/Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
41:9:25/When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit, "You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
41:9:26/The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."
41:9:27/But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
41:9:28/After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
41:9:29/He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer."
41:9:30/They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,
41:9:31/because he was teaching his disciples. He told them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."
41:9:32/But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
41:9:33/When they arrived in Capernaum and were in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"
41:9:34/But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
41:9:35/He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."
41:9:36/He took a little child and placed him among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them,
41:9:37/"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not just welcome me but the one who sent me."
41:9:38/John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."
41:9:39/But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me.
41:9:40/For whoever is not against us is for us.
41:9:41/Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward."
41:9:42/"If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea.
41:9:43/If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It's better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
41:9:44/Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
41:9:45/If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It's better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell, where the fire never goes out.
41:9:46/Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
41:9:47/If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It's better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
41:9:48/Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
41:9:49/Everyone will be purified with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.
41:9:50/Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other.
41:10:1/He got up from there and went to the region of Judea across the Jordan. Again, crowds gathered around him, and as usual, he taught them.
41:10:2/The Pharisees approached him to test him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
41:10:3/He replied, "What did Moses command you?"
41:10:4/They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."
41:10:5/Jesus said to them, "Because of your hard hearts, he wrote you this commandment.
41:10:6/"But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.
41:10:7/"For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
41:10:8/"And the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
41:10:9/"Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."
41:10:10/Back in the house, his disciples questioned him again about this matter.
41:10:11/He told them, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
41:10:12/And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
41:10:13/People were bringing little children to him for him to touch, but the disciples scolded them.
41:10:14/Seeing this, Jesus was indignant and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
41:10:15/Truly, I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
41:10:16/He embraced them, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.
41:10:17/As he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up, knelt before him, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
41:10:18/Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
41:10:19/You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'"
41:10:20/He responded, "Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth."
41:10:21/Looking at him with love, Jesus said, "One thing you lack: go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
41:10:22/But he was disheartened by this and went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
41:10:23/Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"
41:10:24/His disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is for those who trust in wealth to enter the kingdom of God!
41:10:25/It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
41:10:26/They were exceedingly astonished and asked each other, "Then who can be saved?"
41:10:27/Jesus looked at them and said, "With humans it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God."
41:10:28/Peter began to say to him, "Look, we have left everything and followed you."
41:10:29/Jesus replied, "Truly, I tell you, no one who has left home, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or fields for my sake and for the gospel
41:10:30/will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.
41:10:31/But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
41:10:32/They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and they were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. He took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him,
41:10:33/saying, "Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
41:10:34/who will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him. Three days later he will rise."
41:10:35/James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached him and said, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
41:10:36/He asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
41:10:37/They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."
41:10:38/But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you're asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"
41:10:39/They answered, "We can." Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
41:10:40/but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
41:10:41/When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
41:10:42/Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
41:10:43/But it shall not be so among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
41:10:44/and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
41:10:45/For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
41:10:46/They reached Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man named Bartimaeus (that is, the son of Timaeus) was sitting by the roadside begging.
41:10:47/When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41:10:48/Many rebuked him, telling him to be silent, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41:10:49/Jesus stopped and ordered him to be called. They called the blind man, saying, "Cheer up! Get on your feet; he's calling you."
41:10:50/Throwing aside his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus.
41:10:51/Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."
41:10:52/Jesus told him, "Go, your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
41:11:1/As they approached Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples ahead,
41:11:2/And instructed them, "Go into the village opposite you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied up, one that no one has ever ridden; untie it and bring it here.
41:11:3/If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.'"
41:11:4/So they went and found the colt tied outside at a crossroads and untied it.
41:11:5/Some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"
41:11:6/They replied just as Jesus had instructed them, and the people allowed them to go.
41:11:7/They brought the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it.
41:11:8/Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields.
41:11:9/Those leading the way and those following shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
41:11:10/"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
41:11:11/Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
41:11:12/The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
41:11:13/Seeing a fig tree in the distance with leaves, he went to find if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
41:11:14/Then Jesus said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.
41:11:15/When they arrived in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,
41:11:16/and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
41:11:17/And he taught them, saying, "Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers."
41:11:18/The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
41:11:19/When evening came, Jesus and his disciples left the city.
41:11:20/In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
41:11:21/Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"
41:11:22/Jesus replied, "Have faith in God.
41:11:23/Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.
41:11:24/Therefore, I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
41:11:25/And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."
41:11:26/But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your sins.
41:11:27/They returned to Jerusalem, and as Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him.
41:11:28/They questioned him, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you the authority to do this?"
41:11:29/Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
41:11:30/Was John's baptism from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me."
41:11:31/They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
41:11:32/But if we say, 'Of human origin'...?" (They feared the people, for everyone believed that John was truly a prophet.)
41:11:33/So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
41:12:1/He started telling them stories. A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a watchtower, leased it to some farmers, and then went away.
41:12:2/When it was time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the vineyard's produce.
41:12:3/But they grabbed him, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed.
41:12:4/Then he sent another servant to them; this one they hit with stones, injured his head, and sent him back humiliated.
41:12:5/He sent another, and they killed him, along with many others; some they beat, others they killed.
41:12:6/So, he had one person left, his beloved son. He sent him last, thinking, 'They will respect my son.'
41:12:7/But those tenants said to each other, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
41:12:8/So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
41:12:9/What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.
41:12:10/Haven't you read this passage: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?
41:12:11/This was the Lord's doing, and it's amazing to us?
41:12:12/They wanted to arrest him but were afraid of the crowd because they knew he had told this story against them. So they left him and went away.
41:12:13/Then they sent some Pharisees and Herodians to him, trying to trap him with his words.
41:12:14/When they arrived, they said, "Teacher, we know you are honest and don't care about anyone's opinion. You don't favor anyone but teach God's way truthfully. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
41:12:15/Should we pay, or shouldn't we?" But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why are you trying to trap me? Bring me a denarius to look at."
41:12:16/They brought one, and he asked them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" They said, "Caesar's."
41:12:17/Then Jesus said, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.
41:12:18/Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
41:12:19/They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise offspring for his brother.
41:12:20/Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
41:12:21/The second one married the widow, but he also died without leaving any children. And the same thing happened with the third.
41:12:22/In the end, all seven had married her and left no children. Last of all, the woman died too.
41:12:23/So in the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be, since all seven were married to her?"
41:12:24/Jesus replied, "Aren't you mistaken, because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God?
41:12:25/When people rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage; instead, they are like the angels in heaven.
41:12:26/Regarding the dead rising, haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
41:12:27/He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken."
41:12:28/One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"
41:12:29/Jesus answered, "The most important one is this: 'Listen, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
41:12:30/Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the most important commandment.
41:12:31/And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."
41:12:32/The teacher of the law said to him, "Well said, Teacher. You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
41:12:33/To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all your soul, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41:12:34/When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
41:12:35/While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How can the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?
41:12:36/David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'
41:12:37/David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41:12:38/In his teaching, he said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,
41:12:39/and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
41:12:40/They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."
41:12:41/Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.
41:12:42/But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.
41:12:43/He called his disciples to him and said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
41:12:44/They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on."
41:13:1/As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look at these amazing stones and buildings!"
41:13:2/Jesus replied, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
41:13:3/While sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
41:13:4/"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that all these things are about to be fulfilled?"
41:13:5/Jesus began to say to them, "Be careful that no one deceives you."
41:13:6/"Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many."
41:13:7/"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be alarmed. These things must happen, but it's not the end yet."
41:13:8/"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines and troubles. These are the beginning of birth pains."
41:13:9/"But be on your guard. They will hand you over to local councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings for my sake, as a witness to them."
41:13:10/"But first, the gospel must be preached to all nations."
41:13:11/"When they arrest you and hand you over, don't worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given to you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit."
41:13:12/"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them killed."
41:13:13/"Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved."
41:13:14/"When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."
41:13:15/"If someone is on the rooftop, they must not go down or enter the house to take anything out."
41:13:16/"If someone is in the field, they must not go back to get their cloak."
41:13:17/"How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!"
41:13:18/"Pray that this will not take place in winter."
41:13:19/"For those days will be a time of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again."
41:13:20/"If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them."
41:13:21/"At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it."
41:13:22/"For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."
41:13:23/"So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time."
41:13:24/"But in those days, following that distress, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,'"
41:13:25/"'The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'"
41:13:26/"At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory."
41:13:27/"And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens."
41:13:28/"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near."
41:13:29/"In the same way, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door."
41:13:30/"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."
41:13:31/"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away."
41:13:32/"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
41:13:33/"Be on guard, be alert and pray; you do not know when that time will come."
41:13:34/"It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch."
41:13:35/"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn."
41:13:36/"If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping."
41:13:37/"What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"
41:14:1/In two days, it was the Passover feast and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest him secretly and kill him.
41:14:2/But they said, "Not during the feast, or there may be a riot among the people."
41:14:3/While he was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper, sitting at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
41:14:4/Some of those present were indignant and said to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?
41:14:5/It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor." And they criticized her sharply.
41:14:6/But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
41:14:7/You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them anytime you want. But you will not always have me.
41:14:8/She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
41:14:9/Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
41:14:10/Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
41:14:11/When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So he looked for an opportunity to betray him.
41:14:12/On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
41:14:13/So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
41:14:14/Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
41:14:15/He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."
41:14:16/The disciples left, went into the city, and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
41:14:17/When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
41:14:18/While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me."
41:14:19/They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely you don't mean me?"
41:14:20/He replied, "It is one of the Twelve, one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
41:14:21/The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
41:14:22/While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."
41:14:23/Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
41:14:24/He said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
41:14:25/Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41:14:26/After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
41:14:27/Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
41:14:28/But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
41:14:29/Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."
41:14:30/Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will disown me three times."
41:14:31/But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.
41:14:32/They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
41:14:33/He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
41:14:34/"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."
41:14:35/Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.
41:14:36/"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
41:14:37/Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour?
41:14:38/Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
41:14:39/Once more he went away and prayed, saying the same thing.
41:14:40/When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
41:14:41/Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
41:14:42/Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
41:14:43/Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
41:14:44/Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
41:14:45/Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.
41:14:46/The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
41:14:47/Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
41:14:48/"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
41:14:49/Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
41:14:50/Then everyone deserted him and fled.
41:14:51/A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,
41:14:52/he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
41:14:53/They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together.
41:14:54/Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
41:14:55/The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
41:14:56/Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
41:14:57/Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
41:14:58/"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"
41:14:59/Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
41:14:60/The high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
41:14:61/But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"
41:14:62/"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
41:14:63/The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.
41:14:64/"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.
41:14:65/Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.
41:14:66/While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.
41:14:67/When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.
41:14:68/But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway, and the rooster crowed.
41:14:69/The servant girl saw him there and said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."
41:14:70/Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
41:14:71/He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."
41:14:72/Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.
41:15:1/Early in the morning, the chief priests, along with the elders, scribes, and the entire council, arrested Jesus, tied him up, and took him to Pilate.
41:15:2/Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said so."
41:15:3/The chief priests accused him of many things, but he didn't respond.
41:15:4/Pilate questioned him again, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many accusations they're making against you."
41:15:5/But Jesus still didn't say anything, which amazed Pilate.
41:15:6/During the festival, Pilate would release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.
41:15:7/There was a man named Barabbas, imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an uprising.
41:15:8/The crowd shouted, asking Pilate to do what he usually did for them.
41:15:9/Pilate responded, "Do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?"
41:15:10/He knew the chief priests had handed Jesus over because they were jealous.
41:15:11/But the chief priests persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas's release instead.
41:15:12/Pilate asked them again, "Then what should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?"
41:15:13/They shouted back, "Crucify him."
41:15:14/Pilate asked, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
41:15:15/So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged and then handed him over to be crucified.
41:15:16/The soldiers took Jesus into the governor's palace and gathered the whole company around him.
41:15:17/They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and put it on his head,
41:15:18/And began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
41:15:19/They struck him on the head with a staff, spat on him, and knelt in mock worship.
41:15:20/After mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
41:15:21/They forced a man named Simon from Cyrene, who was passing by, to carry Jesus's cross.
41:15:22/They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull."
41:15:23/They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
41:15:24/After crucifying him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.
41:15:25/It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
41:15:26/The charge against him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41:15:27/They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.
41:15:28/This fulfilled the scripture that says, "He was counted among the lawbreakers."
41:15:29/People passing by insulted him, shaking their heads and saying, "So, you who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
41:15:30/Save yourself and come down from the cross."
41:15:31/Similarly, the chief priests and scribes mocked him among themselves, saying, "He saved others, but he can't save himself.
41:15:32/Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so we can see and believe." Even those crucified with him taunted him.
41:15:33/At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three in the afternoon.
41:15:34/At three, Jesus cried out loudly, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"
41:15:35/Some bystanders, hearing this, said, "Listen, he's calling for Elijah."
41:15:36/Someone ran, soaked a sponge in vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink, saying, "Wait, let's see if Elijah comes to take him down."
41:15:37/Jesus cried out loudly and then died.
41:15:38/The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
41:15:39/When the centurion standing there saw how Jesus died, he said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God."
41:15:40/Some women were watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,
41:15:41/Who had followed him and cared for his needs in Galilee, along with many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
41:15:42/As evening approached, since it was the day of Preparation, the day before the Sabbath,
41:15:43/Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God, bravely went to Pilate and asked for Jesus's body.
41:15:44/Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead. He summoned the centurion to ask if Jesus had died some time ago.
41:15:45/When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
41:15:46/Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
41:15:47/Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
41:16:1/After the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought fragrant spices so they could go and anoint Jesus' body.
41:16:2/Early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb.
41:16:3/They were wondering among themselves, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?"
41:16:4/But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.
41:16:5/When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were startled.
41:16:6/He said to them, "Don't be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. Look, this is the place where they laid him.
41:16:7/But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"
41:16:8/They left the tomb quickly, running away from it in terror and amazement. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
41:16:9/Now after Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.
41:16:10/She went and told those who had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.
41:16:11/But when they heard that he was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
41:16:12/Later, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the countryside.
41:16:13/These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.
41:16:14/Later, he appeared to the eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
41:16:15/He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all creation.
41:16:16/Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
41:16:17/And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name, they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;
41:16:18/They will pick up snakes; and if they drink any poisonous thing, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well."
41:16:19/So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God.
41:16:20/And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the message by accompanying signs. Amen.
42:1:1/Many have tried to compile a narrative of the events that are firmly believed among us,
42:1:2/Just as they were passed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
42:1:3/So, it seemed good to me as well, having carefully investigated everything from the start, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
42:1:4/So that you may know the certainty of the teachings you have received.
42:1:5/During the time of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah. His wife, Elisabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.
42:1:6/Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.
42:1:7/But they were childless because Elisabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.
42:1:8/Once, when Zacharias was serving as priest before God and his division was on duty,
42:1:9/He was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
42:1:10/And the whole assembly of the people was praying outside at the time of incense.
42:1:11/Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
42:1:12/When Zacharias saw him, he was startled and overcome with fear.
42:1:13/But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elisabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.
42:1:14/You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
42:1:15/For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.
42:1:16/Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
42:1:17/And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42:1:18/Zacharias asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."
42:1:19/The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
42:1:20/Now, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."
42:1:21/Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
42:1:22/When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
42:1:23/When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
42:1:24/After this, his wife Elisabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She said,
42:1:25/"This is how the Lord has dealt with me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my disgrace among people."
42:1:26/In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
42:1:27/To a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
42:1:28/The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."
42:1:29/Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
42:1:30/But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.
42:1:31/You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
42:1:32/He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
42:1:33/And he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."
42:1:34/Mary asked the angel, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?"
42:1:35/The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.
42:1:36/Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.
42:1:37/For no word from God will ever fail."
42:1:38/Mary said, "I am the Lord's servant. May your word to me be fulfilled." Then the angel left her.
42:1:39/Mary got up and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
42:1:40/Where she entered Zacharias' home and greeted Elisabeth.
42:1:41/When Elisabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42:1:42/In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
42:1:43/But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
42:1:44/As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
42:1:45/Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"
42:1:46/And Mary said, "My soul glorifies the Lord,
42:1:47/And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.
42:1:48/For he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
42:1:49/For the Mighty One has done great things for me—holy is his name.
42:1:50/His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
42:1:51/He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
42:1:52/He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
42:1:53/He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
42:1:54/He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
42:1:55/To Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."
42:1:56/Mary stayed with Elisabeth for about three months and then returned home.
42:1:57/When it was time for Elisabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
42:1:58/Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.
42:1:59/On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zacharias,
42:1:60/But his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."
42:1:61/They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."
42:1:62/Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
42:1:63/He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."
42:1:64/Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.
42:1:65/All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
42:1:66/Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.
42:1:67/His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
42:1:68/"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
42:1:69/He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42:1:70/(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
42:1:71/That we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.
42:1:72/To show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
42:1:73/The oath he swore to our father Abraham:
42:1:74/To rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
42:1:75/In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
42:1:76/And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
42:1:77/To give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
42:1:78/Because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
42:1:79/To shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."
42:1:80/And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.
42:2:1/At that time, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
42:2:2/(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
42:2:3/Everyone went to their own town to register.
42:2:4/Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
42:2:5/He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
42:2:6/While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
42:2:7/and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
42:2:8/And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
42:2:9/An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
42:2:10/But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
42:2:11/Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.
42:2:12/This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
42:2:13/Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
42:2:14/"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."
42:2:15/When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."
42:2:16/So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.
42:2:17/When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,
42:2:18/and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
42:2:19/But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
42:2:20/The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
42:2:21/On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.
42:2:22/When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
42:2:23/(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord"),
42:2:24/and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."
42:2:25/Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
42:2:26/It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
42:2:27/Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,
42:2:28/Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,
42:2:29/"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
42:2:30/For my eyes have seen your salvation,
42:2:31/which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:
42:2:32/a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."
42:2:33/His father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
42:2:34/Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
42:2:35/so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."
42:2:36/There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
42:2:37/and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
42:2:38/Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
42:2:39/When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
42:2:40/And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.
42:2:41/Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.
42:2:42/When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom.
42:2:43/After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.
42:2:44/Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.
42:2:45/When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
42:2:46/After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions.
42:2:47/Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
42:2:48/When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."
42:2:49/"Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"
42:2:50/But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
42:2:51/Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.
42:2:52/And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and people.
42:3:1/Now in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign, with Pontius Pilate as governor of Judaea, Herod as tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip as tetrarch of Ituraea and the Trachonitis region, and Lysanias as the tetrarch of Abilene,
42:3:2/Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, God's message came to John, Zacharias's son, in the wilderness.
42:3:3/He traveled throughout the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism of repentance to forgive sins;
42:3:4/As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
42:3:5/"Every valley shall be filled in, and every mountain and hill made low; the crooked roads shall become straight, and the rough ways smooth;"
42:3:6/And everyone will see God's salvation.
42:3:7/Then he said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to escape the coming wrath?
42:3:8/Therefore, produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not start thinking to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
42:3:9/And now the axe is already at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."
42:3:10/And the crowds asked him, "What should we do then?"
42:3:11/He replied, "Whoever has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and whoever has food should do the same."
42:3:12/Even tax collectors came to be baptized and asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?"
42:3:13/He told them, "Don't collect any more than you are required to."
42:3:14/Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely—be satisfied with your pay."
42:3:15/While the people were filled with expectation and all were wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah,
42:3:16/John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
42:3:17/His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
42:3:18/And with many other words, he preached good news to the people.
42:3:19/But when Herod the tetrarch was rebuked by him because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the other evil things Herod had done,
42:3:20/Herod added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
42:3:21/Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus had also been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,
42:3:22/And the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
42:3:23/And Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was (as was thought) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
42:3:24/The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph,
42:3:25/The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Naum, the son of Esli, the son of Nagge,
42:3:26/The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Juda,
42:3:27/The son of Joanna, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri,
42:3:28/The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,
42:3:29/The son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
42:3:30/The son of Simeon, the son of Juda, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,
42:3:31/The son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
42:3:32/The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Booz, the son of Salmon, the son of Naasson,
42:3:33/The son of Aminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Esrom, the son of Phares, the son of Juda,
42:3:34/The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Thara, the son of Nachor,
42:3:35/The son of Saruch, the son of Ragau, the son of Phalec, the son of Heber, the son of Sala,
42:3:36/The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Sem, the son of Noe, the son of Lamech,
42:3:37/The son of Mathusala, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel, the son of Cainan,
42:3:38/The son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
42:4:1/And Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
42:4:2/For forty days, he was tempted by the devil. During those days, he ate nothing, and at the end, he was hungry.
42:4:3/The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
42:4:4/Jesus answered, "It is written, 'People do not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
42:4:5/The devil took him to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.
42:4:6/The devil said to him, "I will give you all this authority and their glory, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
42:4:7/If you worship me, it will all be yours."
42:4:8/Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"
42:4:9/Then he took him to Jerusalem, set him on the highest point of the temple, and said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.
42:4:10/For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;
42:4:11/and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
42:4:12/Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
42:4:13/When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.
42:4:14/Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.
42:4:15/He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
42:4:16/He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,
42:4:17/and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written,
42:4:18/"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free,
42:4:19/to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."
42:4:20/Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.
42:4:21/He began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
42:4:22/All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.
42:4:23/He said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"
42:4:24/"Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
42:4:25/But I tell you the truth, there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
42:4:26/Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.
42:4:27/And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian."
42:4:28/All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
42:4:29/They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.
42:4:30/But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
42:4:31/Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people.
42:4:32/They were amazed at his teaching because his words had authority.
42:4:33/In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,
42:4:34/"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
42:4:35/Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" And the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.
42:4:36/Everyone was amazed and said to each other, "What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!"
42:4:37/And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
42:4:38/Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
42:4:39/So he bent over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to serve them.
42:4:40/At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.
42:4:41/Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew he was the Messiah.
42:4:42/At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.
42:4:43/But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."
42:4:44/And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
42:5:1/As the crowd gathered around him to listen to the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
42:5:2/He noticed two boats by the lake; the fishermen had left them and were cleaning their nets.
42:5:3/He got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push off a bit from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
42:5:4/After he finished speaking, he told Simon, "Head out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."
42:5:5/Simon replied, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I'll let down the nets."
42:5:6/When they did, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear.
42:5:7/They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they started to sink.
42:5:8/Seeing this, Simon Peter fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Leave me, Lord; I'm a sinful man."
42:5:9/He and everyone with him were amazed at the catch of fish they had taken,
42:5:10/As were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you'll be fishing for people."
42:5:11/When they brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.
42:5:12/While in a certain city, a man covered in leprosy saw Jesus, fell on his face, and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
42:5:13/Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said, "I am willing; be clean." Immediately the leprosy left him.
42:5:14/He instructed him not to tell anyone, but to go show himself to the priest and offer the sacrifices Moses commanded for his cleansing, as a testimony to them.
42:5:15/But news about him spread even more, and large crowds gathered to listen and to be healed of their sicknesses.
42:5:16/Yet, he often withdrew to deserted places and prayed.
42:5:17/One day, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting nearby. They had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal.
42:5:18/Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.
42:5:19/When they couldn't find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
42:5:20/Seeing their faith, Jesus said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
42:5:21/But the scribes and Pharisees began to think to themselves, "Who is this who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
42:5:22/Knowing their thoughts, Jesus asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
42:5:23/Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
42:5:24/But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
42:5:25/Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on, and went home praising God.
42:5:26/Everyone was amazed and praised God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."
42:5:27/After this, he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him.
42:5:28/And leaving everything, he got up and followed him.
42:5:29/Levi held a large banquet for Jesus at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
42:5:30/But the Pharisees and their scribes complained to his disciples, asking, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
42:5:31/Jesus answered them, "It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
42:5:32/I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42:5:33/They asked him, "Why do John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"
42:5:34/He replied, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?
42:5:35/But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."
42:5:36/He also told them a parable: "No one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.
42:5:37/And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined.
42:5:38/But new wine must be put into new wineskins.
42:5:39/And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"
42:6:1/On the second Sabbath after the first, he walked through the grain fields; his disciples picked some heads of grain, ate them, rubbing them in their hands.
42:6:2/Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
42:6:3/Jesus answered them, "Haven't you ever read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
42:6:4/He entered the house of God, took and ate the consecrated bread, and also gave some to his companions, which is not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat."
42:6:5/Then he told them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
42:6:6/On another Sabbath, he went into the synagogue and taught, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
42:6:7/The scribes and Pharisees watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they could find a reason to accuse him.
42:6:8/But knowing their thoughts, he said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.
42:6:9/Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"
42:6:10/He looked around at them all and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.
42:6:11/But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
42:6:12/During those days, he went out to a mountain to pray and spent the night praying to God.
42:6:13/When daylight came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:
42:6:14/Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
42:6:15/Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon called the Zealot,
42:6:16/Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
42:6:17/He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,
42:6:18/who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured,
42:6:19/and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.
42:6:20/Looking at his disciples, he said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
42:6:21/Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
42:6:22/Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
42:6:23/Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.
42:6:24/But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.
42:6:25/Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
42:6:26/Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.
42:6:27/But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
42:6:28/Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
42:6:29/If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.
42:6:30/Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.
42:6:31/Do to others as you would have them do to you.
42:6:32/If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
42:6:33/And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.
42:6:34/And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
42:6:35/But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
42:6:36/Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
42:6:37/Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42:6:38/Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
42:6:39/He told them this parable: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?
42:6:40/A student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.
42:6:41/Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
42:6:42/How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
42:6:43/A good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
42:6:44/Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
42:6:45/A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in their heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
42:6:46/Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
42:6:47/Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like:
42:6:48/They are like a person building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.
42:6:49/But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.
42:7:1/After finishing all his teachings in front of the crowd, he went into Capernaum.
42:7:2/A centurion had a servant who was very important to him, and this servant was ill and close to death.
42:7:3/When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his servant.
42:7:4/They approached Jesus and urgently pleaded with him, saying, "He deserves your help because:
42:7:5/He loves our people and even built a synagogue for us."
42:7:6/So, Jesus went with them. When he wasn't far from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself. I don't deserve to have you come under my roof,
42:7:7/That's why I didn't consider myself worthy to come to you. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
42:7:8/I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one 'Go,' and he goes; another 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant 'Do this,' and he does it."
42:7:9/Amazed by what he heard, Jesus turned to the crowd following him and said, "I tell you, I haven't found such great faith even in Israel."
42:7:10/The messengers returned to the house and found the servant completely healed.
42:7:11/The next day, he went to a town called Nain, accompanied by his disciples and a large crowd.
42:7:12/As he approached the town gate, a funeral procession was coming out. The dead man was the only son of a widow, and a large crowd from the town was with her.
42:7:13/Seeing her, the Lord felt compassion for her and said, "Don't cry."
42:7:14/He went up and touched the coffin, and the bearers stopped. He said, "Young man, I tell you, get up."
42:7:15/The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
42:7:16/Everyone was filled with awe and praised God, saying, "A great prophet has appeared among us," and "God has come to help his people."
42:7:17/News about him spread throughout Judea and the surrounding area.
42:7:18/John's disciples told him about all these things.
42:7:19/John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"
42:7:20/When the men arrived, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to ask you, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?'"
42:7:21/Right then, he healed many people of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and he gave sight to many who were blind.
42:7:22/So Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
42:7:23/And blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."
42:7:24/After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
42:7:25/What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
42:7:26/But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
42:7:27/He is the one about whom it is written, 'Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
42:7:28/I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42:7:29/Everyone who heard this, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God's justice, having been baptized with John's baptism.
42:7:30/But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John.
42:7:31/Then the Lord said, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
42:7:32/They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other: 'We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance; we sang a dirge, and you didn't cry.'
42:7:33/For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
42:7:34/The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
42:7:35/Yet wisdom is proved right by all her children."
42:7:36/A Pharisee invited him to dine with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
42:7:37/And there was a woman in the city who was known as a sinner. When she found out Jesus was dining at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
42:7:38/and stood behind him at his feet, crying. She began to wet his feet with her tears, then wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the perfume.
42:7:39/When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he thought to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she's a sinner."
42:7:40/Jesus responded, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Go ahead, Teacher," he said.
42:7:41/"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42:7:42/Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"
42:7:43/Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
42:7:44/Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house, and you didn't provide water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
42:7:45/You didn't give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.
42:7:46/You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.
42:7:47/Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."
42:7:48/Then he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
42:7:49/The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
42:7:50/And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
42:8:1/After that, he traveled through every city and village, spreading the good news of God's kingdom, accompanied by the twelve.
42:8:2/Among them were women who had been cured of evil spirits and illnesses, including Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been expelled,
42:8:3/Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, Susanna, and many others who supported him with their resources.
42:8:4/When a large crowd had gathered and people came to him from every city, he told them a parable:
42:8:5/A farmer went out to plant his seeds. As he scattered them, some seeds fell along the path, where they were stepped on, and birds ate them up.
42:8:6/Some seeds fell on rocky ground, and when they sprouted, they withered away because they had no moisture.
42:8:7/Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up with them and choked the plants.
42:8:8/Still, other seeds fell on fertile soil, grew, and produced a crop a hundred times more than was sown. After saying this, he shouted, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
42:8:9/His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
42:8:10/He replied, "You have been given the knowledge of the secrets of God's kingdom, but to others, I speak in parables so that 'though they see, they may not see; though they hear, they may not understand.'"
42:8:11/This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is God's word.
42:8:12/The seeds along the path represent those who hear, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, preventing them from believing and being saved.
42:8:13/The seeds on the rock represent those who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in times of testing, they fall away.
42:8:14/The seeds that fell among thorns stand for those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature.
42:8:15/But the seeds on good soil represent those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.
42:8:16/No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so those who come in can see the light.
42:8:17/For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.
42:8:18/Therefore, consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them."
42:8:19/Then his mother and brothers came to see him but couldn't get through the crowd.
42:8:20/Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."
42:8:21/He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."
42:8:22/One day, he got into a boat with his disciples and said, "Let's go across to the other side of the lake." So they set out.
42:8:23/While they were sailing, he fell asleep. A storm swept down on the lake, and they were taking on water and were in danger.
42:8:24/They went to him and woke him, shouting, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up, rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.
42:8:25/He asked them, "Where is your faith?" In fear and amazement, they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."
42:8:26/They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.
42:8:27/When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a man from the town who was possessed by demons. For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house but had lived in the tombs.
42:8:28/Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"
42:8:29/(For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.)
42:8:30/Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.
42:8:31/And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
42:8:32/A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.
42:8:33/When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
42:8:34/When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,
42:8:35/and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
42:8:36/Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.
42:8:37/Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
42:8:38/The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
42:8:39/"Go back to your home, and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.
42:8:40/When Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.
42:8:41/Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house
42:8:42/because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
42:8:43/And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.
42:8:44/She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
42:8:45/Jesus asked, "Who touched me?" When everyone denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."
42:8:46/But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."
42:8:47/Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
42:8:48/He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."
42:8:49/While he was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher anymore."
42:8:50/Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
42:8:51/When he arrived at the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the girl's father and mother.
42:8:52/Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."
42:8:53/They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
42:8:54/But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"
42:8:55/Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
42:8:56/Her parents were amazed, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
42:9:1/Then he gathered his twelve disciples, giving them power and authority over all demons, and to heal illnesses.
42:9:2/He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42:9:3/He instructed them, "Take nothing for your journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money; and don't have an extra shirt.
42:9:4/Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the area.
42:9:5/If anyone doesn't welcome you, as you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a warning to them."
42:9:6/So they set out and traveled from village to village, spreading the good news and healing everywhere.
42:9:7/Now Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening, and he was puzzled because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
42:9:8/While others claimed that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life.
42:9:9/Herod said, "I beheaded John. So who is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.
42:9:10/When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida.
42:9:11/But the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
42:9:12/As the day was ending, the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, because we are in a remote place here."
42:9:13/But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They replied, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people."
42:9:14/(There were about five thousand men.) He said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
42:9:15/They did so, and had everyone sit down.
42:9:16/Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.
42:9:17/Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they picked up twelve baskets of leftover pieces.
42:9:18/Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
42:9:19/They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."
42:9:20/He asked them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "God's Messiah."
42:9:21/He strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
42:9:22/He said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
42:9:23/Then he said to them all, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross daily, and follow me.
42:9:24/For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.
42:9:25/What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?
42:9:26/If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
42:9:27/Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."
42:9:28/About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John, and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.
42:9:29/As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.
42:9:30/Suddenly, two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.
42:9:31/They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
42:9:32/Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
42:9:33/As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it's good for us to be here. Let's make three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)
42:9:34/While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
42:9:35/A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."
42:9:36/When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
42:9:37/The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
42:9:38/A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
42:9:39/A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
42:9:40/I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't."
42:9:41/Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and twisted generation, how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."
42:9:42/Even as the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
42:9:43/And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
42:9:44/"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
42:9:45/But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
42:9:46/An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.
42:9:47/Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
42:9:48/He told them, "Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest."
42:9:49/John spoke up, "Master, we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."
42:9:50/Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for whoever is not against you is for you."
42:9:51/As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
42:9:52/He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;
42:9:53/But the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
42:9:54/When his disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"
42:9:55/But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
42:9:56/For the Son of Man did not come to destroy people's lives but to save them. And they went to another village.
42:9:57/As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
42:9:58/Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
42:9:59/To another person, Jesus said, "Follow me." But he replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
42:9:60/Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
42:9:61/Another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me say goodbye to my family."
42:9:62/Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."
42:10:1/After these events, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them out in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He planned to go.
42:10:2/So He told them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest field.
42:10:3/Go on your way; look, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
42:10:4/Don't carry a wallet, a bag, or sandals; and don't stop to greet anyone on the road.
42:10:5/Whenever you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.'
42:10:6/If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.
42:10:7/Stay in that same house, eating and drinking whatever they offer, for the worker deserves their wages. Do not move around from house to house.
42:10:8/When you enter a city and they welcome you, eat what is offered to you.
42:10:9/Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
42:10:10/But when you enter a city and they do not welcome you, go into its streets and say,
42:10:11/'Even the dust of your city that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: the kingdom of God has come near.'
42:10:12/But I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that city.
42:10:13/Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
42:10:14/But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
42:10:15/And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.
42:10:16/Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me."
42:10:17/The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."
42:10:18/He said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
42:10:19/Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will harm you.
42:10:20/However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
42:10:21/In that moment, Jesus was filled with joy through the Holy Spirit and said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
42:10:22/Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."
42:10:23/Then He turned to His disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
42:10:24/For I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."
42:10:25/Then a legal expert stood up to test Him, saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42:10:26/He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"
42:10:27/And he answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and love your neighbor as yourself."
42:10:28/He said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."
42:10:29/But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
42:10:30/Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.
42:10:31/A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
42:10:32/So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
42:10:33/But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him,
42:10:34/and went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
42:10:35/The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'
42:10:36/"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"
42:10:37/The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."
42:10:38/As they continued on their journey, He entered a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
42:10:39/She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what He said.
42:10:40/But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to Him and asked, "Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me."
42:10:41/Jesus answered, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things,
42:10:42/but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her."
42:11:1/It happened that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he finished, one of his disciples asked him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
42:11:2/He told them, "When you pray, say, 'Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
42:11:3/Give us each day our daily bread.
42:11:4/And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive everyone who owes us. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
42:11:5/He then said to them, "Imagine one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;
42:11:6/because a friend of mine has arrived from a journey, and I have nothing to offer him.'
42:11:7/And he answers from inside, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up to give you anything.'
42:11:8/I tell you, even though he won't get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
42:11:9/And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
42:11:10/For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
42:11:11/If a son asks for bread from any of you who is a father, would you give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, would you give him a snake instead?
42:11:12/Or if he asks for an egg, would you offer him a scorpion?
42:11:13/So if you, despite being imperfect, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
42:11:14/He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people were amazed.
42:11:15/But some of them said, "He drives out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons."
42:11:16/And others, testing him, demanded a sign from heaven.
42:11:17/But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is ruined, and a divided household falls.
42:11:18/If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? You say I drive out demons by Beelzebub.
42:11:19/And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So they will be your judges.
42:11:20/But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
42:11:21/When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.
42:11:22/But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor the man relied on and divides up his plunder.
42:11:23/Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
42:11:24/When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and, finding none, it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'
42:11:25/When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
42:11:26/Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first."
42:11:27/As he was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed."
42:11:28/But he said, "Indeed, blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it."
42:11:29/When the crowds were gathering in large numbers, he began to say, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
42:11:30/For just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.
42:11:31/The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom; and now, something greater than Solomon is here.
42:11:32/The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now, something greater than Jonah is here.
42:11:33/No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who enter can see the light.
42:11:34/The eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light. But when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.
42:11:35/Therefore, be careful lest the light in you be darkness.
42:11:36/If your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be completely illuminated, as when a lamp shines its light on you."
42:11:37/While he was speaking, a Pharisee invited him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at the table.
42:11:38/But the Pharisee was surprised to see that he did not first wash before the meal.
42:11:39/And the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
42:11:40/You fools! Didn't the one who made the outside make the inside as well?
42:11:41/But give what is inside as charity, and then everything will be clean for you.
42:11:42/But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all kinds of herbs, and neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
42:11:43/Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
42:11:44/Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing."
42:11:45/Then one of the experts in the law said to him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us too."
42:11:46/And he said, "Woe to you experts in the law, too! For you burden people with burdens hard to bear, yet you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
42:11:47/Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.
42:11:48/So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.
42:11:49/For this reason also, the wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,'
42:11:50/so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world,
42:11:51/from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.
42:11:52/Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."
42:11:53/As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose him fiercely and to provoke him to speak about many things,
42:11:54/lying in wait for him, to catch something from his mouth that they might accuse him.
42:12:1/At that time, when a countless crowd had gathered, so much so that they were stepping on each other, he began to tell his disciples first and foremost, "Be cautious of the Pharisees' influence, which is all about pretending to be something you're not."
42:12:2/For there is nothing hidden that won't be uncovered; nor anything secret that won't become known.
42:12:3/So, whatever you've said in the dark will be heard in the light; and what you've whispered in private rooms will be shouted from the rooftops.
42:12:4/And I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid of those who can kill the body but after that can do no more.
42:12:5/But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear the one who, after killing, has the power to throw you into hell; yes, I tell you, fear him.
42:12:6/Aren't five sparrows sold for just a couple of pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
42:12:7/But even the hairs on your head are all counted. So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
42:12:8/Also, I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.
42:12:9/But whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.
42:12:10/And anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42:12:11/And when they bring you before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, don't worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say.
42:12:12/For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you should say.
42:12:13/Then someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me."
42:12:14/But he replied, "Friend, who appointed me as a judge or arbitrator over you?"
42:12:15/Then he said to them, "Watch out and be on guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions."
42:12:16/He told them a story: "The land of a certain wealthy man produced a great crop.
42:12:17/He thought to himself, 'What should I do, since I don't have space to store my crops?'
42:12:18/Then he said, 'This is what I'll do: I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and goods.
42:12:19/And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of goods stored up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself."'
42:12:20/But God said to him, 'You fool, tonight your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'
42:12:21/This is how it will be for anyone who stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God."
42:12:22/Then he said to his disciples, "Therefore, I tell you, don't worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.
42:12:23/Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
42:12:24/Consider the ravens: They don't plant or harvest; they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!
42:12:25/Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?
42:12:26/If you can't do such a small thing, why worry about the rest?
42:12:27/Consider how the wild flowers grow: They don't labor or spin yarn. Yet, I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
42:12:28/If that's how God clothes the grass in the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith?
42:12:29/So don't set your heart on what you will eat or drink; don't worry about it.
42:12:30/For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them.
42:12:31/But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.
42:12:32/Don't be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
42:12:33/Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
42:12:34/For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
42:12:35/Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,
42:12:36/like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.
42:12:37/Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table, and will come and wait on them.
42:12:38/And if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them prepared in this way, blessed are those servants.
42:12:39/But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
42:12:40/You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."
42:12:41/Then Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"
42:12:42/And the Lord answered, "Who, then, is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?
42:12:43/Blessed is that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
42:12:44/Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
42:12:45/But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he starts to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk.
42:12:46/The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
42:12:47/That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows.
42:12:48/But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
42:12:49/I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!
42:12:50/But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!
42:12:51/Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
42:12:52/From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.
42:12:53/Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
42:12:54/He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does.
42:12:55/And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is.
42:12:56/You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don't know how to interpret this present time?
42:12:57/And why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
42:12:58/When you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
42:12:59/I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.
42:13:1/At that time, some people told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
42:13:2/Jesus responded, "Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered this fate?
42:13:3/I tell you, no; but unless you change your ways, you will all perish just as they did.
42:13:4/Or what about those eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were more guilty than everyone else living in Jerusalem?
42:13:5/I tell you, no; but unless you change your ways, you will all perish just as they did.
42:13:6/He also told this parable: "A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but found none.
42:13:7/He said to the gardener, 'Look, for three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'
42:13:8/"But the gardener answered, 'Sir, leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.
42:13:9/If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"
42:13:10/And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
42:13:11/There was a woman there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
42:13:12/When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."
42:13:13/He put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
42:13:14/But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."
42:13:15/The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
42:13:16/Then shouldn't this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"
42:13:17/When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
42:13:18/Then he asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?
42:13:19/It's like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches."
42:13:20/Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?
42:13:21/It's like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."
42:13:22/He continued his journey through towns and villages, teaching and making his way to Jerusalem.
42:13:23/Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,
42:13:24/"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.
42:13:25/Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Lord, open the door for us.' But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'
42:13:26/Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'
42:13:27/But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'
42:13:28/There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.
42:13:29/People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.
42:13:30/Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."
42:13:31/That same day some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."
42:13:32/He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will keep driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'
42:13:33/Yet I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
42:13:34/"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
42:13:35/Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
42:14:1/As he entered the home of one of the leading Pharisees to share a meal on the Sabbath, they closely observed him.
42:14:2/And there, right in front of him, was a man suffering from severe swelling.
42:14:3/Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees by asking, "Is it okay to heal on the Sabbath?"
42:14:4/They remained silent. So, he healed the man and sent him on his way.
42:14:5/Then he said to them, "If one of you has a donkey or an ox that falls into a pit, wouldn't you immediately pull it out on the Sabbath?"
42:14:6/But they had no reply to these points.
42:14:7/He then told a parable to those who were invited, noticing how they picked the places of honor, saying to them,
42:14:8/"When you're invited by someone to a wedding, don't sit in the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by them;
42:14:9/and the host comes to you and says, 'Give this person your seat,' and then in embarrassment, you have to take the least important place.
42:14:10/Instead, when you're invited, go and sit in the least important place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in front of all the other guests.
42:14:11/For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."
42:14:12/Then he also said to the one who had invited him, "When you host a lunch or dinner, don't just invite your friends, family, or rich neighbors, in case they invite you back and you are repaid.
42:14:13/But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
42:14:14/and you will be blessed. Because they can't repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
42:14:15/When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."
42:14:16/Then Jesus replied, "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.
42:14:17/At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, everything is now ready.'
42:14:18/But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I've just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'
42:14:19/Another said, 'I've bought five pairs of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'
42:14:20/Another said, 'I've just got married, so I can't come.'
42:14:21/The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'
42:14:22/The servant said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'
42:14:23/Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.
42:14:24/I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'"
42:14:25/Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said,
42:14:26/"If anyone comes to me and does not put aside their father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—they cannot be my disciple.
42:14:27/And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
42:14:28/"Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Wouldn't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?
42:14:29/Otherwise, if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,
42:14:30/saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.'
42:14:31/"Or what king, going to war against another king, won't sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
42:14:32/If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.
42:14:33/In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.
42:14:34/Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
42:14:35/It is not suitable for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."
42:15:1/Then all the tax collectors and sinners came close to listen to him.
42:15:2/And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and even eats with them."
42:15:3/He told them this story:
42:15:4/"Which one of you, if you have a hundred sheep and lose one, doesn't leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost one until you find it?
42:15:5/And when you find it, you joyfully put it on your shoulders.
42:15:6/And when you get home, you call your friends and neighbors together and say, 'Celebrate with me; I've found my lost sheep.'
42:15:7/I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes their ways than over ninety-nine righteous people who don't need to.
42:15:8/Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one, doesn't light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
42:15:9/And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Celebrate with me; I've found the coin I lost.'
42:15:10/Likewise, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who changes their ways."
42:15:11/He continued, "A certain man had two sons:
42:15:12/And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.
42:15:13/Not long after that, the younger son gathered all he had, set off for a distant country, and there squandered his wealth in wild living.
42:15:14/After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.
42:15:15/So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
42:15:16/He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
42:15:17/When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!
42:15:18/I will set out and go back to my father and say to him, Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you,
42:15:19/I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.'
42:15:20/So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
42:15:21/And the son said to him, 'Father, I've sinned against heaven and in your sight, and I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.'
42:15:22/But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
42:15:23/And bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate.
42:15:24/For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.
42:15:25/Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.
42:15:26/So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on.
42:15:27/'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'
42:15:28/But he became angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.
42:15:29/But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
42:15:30/But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'
42:15:31/'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
42:15:32/But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'
42:16:1/He also told his disciples, "There was a certain wealthy man who had a manager, and this manager was reported to him for squandering his property.
42:16:2/So he called him and said, 'What's this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you can't be manager any longer.'
42:16:3/The manager thought to himself, 'What will I do now? My boss is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm too ashamed to beg.
42:16:4/I've decided what to do so that when I'm removed from management, people will welcome me into their homes.'
42:16:5/So he called each one of his master's debtors, and he asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
42:16:6/He replied, 'A hundred measures of oil.' The manager said, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.'
42:16:7/Then he asked another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' The manager said, 'Take your bill and write eighty.'
42:16:8/The master praised the dishonest manager for acting shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.
42:16:9/And I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it's gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
42:16:10/Whoever is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in large ones, and whoever is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in large ones.
42:16:11/So if you haven't been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?
42:16:12/And if you haven't been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?
42:16:13/No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
42:16:14/The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were scoffing at him.
42:16:15/He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among people is detestable in God's sight.
42:16:16/The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since then, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.
42:16:17/But it is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest part of the Law to become obsolete.
42:16:18/Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
42:16:19/There was a certain wealthy man who dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
42:16:20/And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, covered with sores,
42:16:21/Longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
42:16:22/Eventually, the beggar died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.
42:16:23/In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.
42:16:24/He called out, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'
42:16:25/But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
42:16:26/And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'
42:16:27/He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family's house,
42:16:28/For I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so they will not also come to this place of torment.'
42:16:29/Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'
42:16:30/'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'
42:16:31/Abraham said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'"
42:17:1/Then he said to the disciples, "It's inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come!
42:17:2/It would be better for that person to have a millstone hung around their neck and be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
42:17:3/Be on your guard: If your brother or sister sins against you, correct them; and if they repent, forgive them.
42:17:4/And if they sin against you seven times in a day, and seven times come back to you saying 'I repent,' you must forgive them."
42:17:5/And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."
42:17:6/And the Lord said, "If you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.
42:17:7/But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'?
42:17:8/Instead, wouldn't you say to him, 'Prepare my meal, get yourself ready and serve me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?
42:17:9/Do you thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? I don't think so.
42:17:10/So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"
42:17:11/As he was on his way to Jerusalem, he passed between Samaria and Galilee.
42:17:12/As he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him. They stood at a distance
42:17:13/and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
42:17:14/When he saw them, he said, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.
42:17:15/One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
42:17:16/He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.
42:17:17/Then Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
42:17:18/Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?"
42:17:19/Then he said to him, "Get up and go on your way; your faith has healed you."
42:17:20/When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,
42:17:21/nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you."
42:17:22/Then he said to the disciples, "The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
42:17:23/People will tell you, 'Look, there he is,' or 'Here he is.' Do not go running off after them.
42:17:24/For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.
42:17:25/But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
42:17:26/Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
42:17:27/People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
42:17:28/Similarly, as it was in the days of Lot: People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building,
42:17:29/but on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
42:17:30/It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
42:17:31/On that day, no one on the rooftop, with their possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.
42:17:32/Remember Lot's wife.
42:17:33/Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.
42:17:34/I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.
42:17:35/Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."
42:17:36/Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
42:17:37/They asked him, "Where, Lord?" He replied, "Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."
42:18:1/He told them a story to show that they should always pray and never give up.
42:18:2/He said, "In a certain city, there was a judge who didn't fear God or care about people.
42:18:3/And in that city, there was a widow who kept coming to him, saying, 'Get justice for me against my adversary.'
42:18:4/For a while, he refused. But later he thought to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care about people,
42:18:5/I will see that she gets justice, so she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"
42:18:6/And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
42:18:7/Won't God bring about justice for His chosen ones, who cry out to Him day and night, even though He is patient with them?
42:18:8/I assure you, He will see that they get justice quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"
42:18:9/He also told this parable to some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else:
42:18:10/"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
42:18:11/The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.
42:18:12/I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'
42:18:13/But the tax collector stood at a distance. He wouldn't even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
42:18:14/I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."
42:18:15/People were also bringing babies to Jesus for Him to touch them. When the disciples saw this, they scolded them.
42:18:16/But Jesus called the children to Him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
42:18:17/Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
42:18:18/And a certain ruler asked Him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42:18:19/Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
42:18:20/You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'"
42:18:21/And he said, "I have kept all these since I was a boy."
42:18:22/When Jesus heard this, He said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
42:18:23/But when he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.
42:18:24/Seeing his reaction, Jesus said, "How difficult it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!
42:18:25/Indeed, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
42:18:26/Those who heard this asked, "Then who can be saved?"
42:18:27/He replied, "What is impossible with humans is possible with God."
42:18:28/Then Peter said, "Look, we've left everything to follow you."
42:18:29/And He said to them, "Truly I tell you, no one who has left home or family or siblings or spouse or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
42:18:30/will fail to receive many times more in this age, and in the age to come, eternal life."
42:18:31/Then He took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
42:18:32/He will be handed over to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted, and spit on.
42:18:33/They will flog Him and kill Him, and on the third day, He will rise again."
42:18:34/But they did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what He was talking about.
42:18:35/As He approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
42:18:36/When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
42:18:37/They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."
42:18:38/He shouted, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42:18:39/Those leading the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42:18:40/Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to Him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,
42:18:41/"What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied.
42:18:42/Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."
42:18:43/Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.
42:19:1/And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
42:19:2/And there was a man named Zacchaeus, who was a top tax collector, and he was wealthy.
42:19:3/He wanted to see who Jesus was, but couldn't because of the crowd, since he was short.
42:19:4/So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way.
42:19:5/When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and saw him, and said, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; I must stay at your house today."
42:19:6/So he hurried down and welcomed him joyfully.
42:19:7/But when everyone saw this, they complained, saying, "He has gone to stay with a sinner."
42:19:8/Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I'll give half of my possessions to the poor; and if I've cheated anyone, I'll pay back four times the amount."
42:19:9/Jesus told him, "Today, salvation has come to this house, because he too is a descendant of Abraham."
42:19:10/For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."
42:19:11/As they listened to this, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.
42:19:12/He said, "A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.
42:19:13/He called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and told them, 'Engage in business until I come back.'
42:19:14/But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to rule over us.'
42:19:15/When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, to find out what they had gained through trading.
42:19:16/The first came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has earned ten more minas.'
42:19:17/He said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, have authority over ten cities.'
42:19:18/And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.'
42:19:19/He also said to him, 'You will be over five cities.'
42:19:20/Another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a cloth.
42:19:21/For I was afraid of you, because you are a strict man; you take what you didn't deposit, and reap what you didn't sow.'
42:19:22/He said to him, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I am a strict man, taking what I didn't deposit and reaping what I didn't sow?
42:19:23/Why then didn't you put my money in the bank, so that when I returned, I could have collected it with interest?'
42:19:24/Then he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'
42:19:25/(And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.')
42:19:26/'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given; but from the one who does not have, even what they have will be taken away.
42:19:27/But as for these enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"
42:19:28/After saying this, he went ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
42:19:29/When he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
42:19:30/Telling them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
42:19:31/If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'"
42:19:32/Those who were sent went and found it just as he had told them.
42:19:33/And as they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
42:19:34/They replied, "The Lord needs it."
42:19:35/They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and put Jesus on it.
42:19:36/As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
42:19:37/As he approached the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen,
42:19:38/Saying, "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
42:19:39/Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
42:19:40/He answered, "I tell you, if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."
42:19:41/As he approached and saw the city, he wept over it,
42:19:42/Saying, "If you, even you, had only recognized on this day the things that bring you peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
42:19:43/For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you, surround you, and hem you in on every side,
42:19:44/And they will level you to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone on another in you, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."
42:19:45/Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling,
42:19:46/Saying to them, "It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers.'"
42:19:47/And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people were trying to kill him,
42:19:48/Yet they could not find a way to do it, because all the people were captivated by what they heard.
42:20:1/It happened that on one of those days, while he was teaching the people in the temple and sharing the good news, the chief priests, scribes, and elders confronted him,
42:20:2/They questioned him, asking, "Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Or who gave you this authority?"
42:20:3/He replied, "I'll ask you one question; answer me:
42:20:4/John's baptism—was it from heaven, or from human origin?"
42:20:5/They debated among themselves, thinking, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
42:20:6/"But if we say, 'From human origin,' everyone will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet."
42:20:7/So they said they didn't know where it was from.
42:20:8/Jesus told them, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things."
42:20:9/He then told the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to some farmers, and went away for a long time.
42:20:10/At harvest time, he sent a servant to the farmers so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
42:20:11/He sent another servant, but they also beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
42:20:12/He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him and threw him out.
42:20:13/Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'
42:20:14/But when the farmers saw him, they discussed it among themselves and said, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him, so the inheritance will be ours.'
42:20:15/So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
42:20:16/He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they said, "Certainly not!"
42:20:17/He looked at them and said, "Then what is the meaning of the scripture, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?
42:20:18/Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but it will crush anyone it falls on."
42:20:19/The chief priests and the scribes wanted to arrest him immediately because they realized he had told this parable against them, but they were afraid of the people.
42:20:20/So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order to trap him in his words and hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.
42:20:21/They questioned him, saying, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and you do not show partiality but teach God's way truthfully.
42:20:22/Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
42:20:23/But he saw through their deceit and said to them, "Why are you trying to trap me?
42:20:24/Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?" They replied, "Caesar's."
42:20:25/He said to them, "Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
42:20:26/They were unable to catch him in his words in the presence of the people; and amazed by his answer, they fell silent.
42:20:27/Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question,
42:20:28/Asking, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
42:20:29/Now there were seven brothers. The first married a woman and died childless.
42:20:30/Then the second married her, and he died childless.
42:20:31/Then the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.
42:20:32/Finally, the woman died too.
42:20:33/At the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since all seven were married to her?"
42:20:34/Jesus replied, "People in this age marry and are given in marriage.
42:20:35/But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,
42:20:36/And they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, being children of the resurrection.
42:20:37/Indeed, even Moses showed in the account of the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
42:20:38/He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."
42:20:39/Some of the scribes replied, "Teacher, you have spoken well."
42:20:40/And they no longer dared to ask him any more questions.
42:20:41/He said to them, "How can they say that the Christ is David's son?
42:20:42/David himself declares in the Book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
42:20:43/Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'
42:20:44/So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
42:20:45/In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
42:20:46/"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at banquets.
42:20:47/They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These will receive a more severe punishment."
42:21:1/He looked up and noticed wealthy individuals putting their donations into the treasury.
42:21:2/He also saw a poor widow putting in two small coins.
42:21:3/He said, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them:
42:21:4/For all of them have contributed out of their wealth to the offerings of God; but she, out of her poverty, has put in everything she had to live on."
42:21:5/As some were talking about the temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,
42:21:6/"As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."
42:21:7/They asked him, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"
42:21:8/He said, "Be careful that you are not misled: for many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.
42:21:9/But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."
42:21:10/Then he told them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42:21:11/There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places, and terrifying events and great signs from heaven.
42:21:12/But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, all on account of my name.
42:21:13/And it will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.
42:21:14/So make up your minds not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
42:21:15/For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
42:21:16/You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
42:21:17/Everyone will hate you because of me.
42:21:18/Yet not a single hair of your head will perish.
42:21:19/By standing firm, you will gain life.
42:21:20/When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.
42:21:21/Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.
42:21:22/For these are the days of punishment to fulfill all that is written.
42:21:23/How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
42:21:24/They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
42:21:25/There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
42:21:26/People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
42:21:27/Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
42:21:28/When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
42:21:29/He told them this parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
42:21:30/When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
42:21:31/In the same way, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
42:21:32/Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
42:21:33/Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
42:21:34/Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.
42:21:35/For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.
42:21:36/Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."
42:21:37/During the day, he was teaching in the temple, and at night he went out and stayed on the hill called the Mount of Olives.
42:21:38/And all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
42:22:1/The festival of unleavened bread was approaching, known as the Passover.
42:22:2/The chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to kill him, as they were afraid of the people's reaction.
42:22:3/Satan then entered Judas, known as Iscariot, who was one of the twelve disciples.
42:22:4/He went and discussed with the chief priests and commanders how he could betray him to them.
42:22:5/They were pleased and agreed to pay him money.
42:22:6/He agreed and looked for a chance to betray him when there was no crowd around.
42:22:7/The day arrived for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed.
42:22:8/He sent Peter and John, instructing them, "Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat."
42:22:9/They asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare it?"
42:22:10/He replied, "Look, when you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters.
42:22:11/Tell the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks, where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'"
42:22:12/He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Prepare it there."
42:22:13/They went and found everything as he had told them and prepared the Passover.
42:22:14/When the time came, he sat down to eat, and the twelve apostles joined him.
42:22:15/He told them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
42:22:16/For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
42:22:17/He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.
42:22:18/For I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
42:22:19/Then he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
42:22:20/Similarly, after supper, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
42:22:21/But look, the hand of the one betraying me is with mine on the table.
42:22:22/Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!"
42:22:23/They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.
42:22:24/A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be the greatest.
42:22:25/He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.
42:22:26/But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.
42:22:27/For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
42:22:28/You are those who have stood by me in my trials.
42:22:29/And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,
42:22:30/so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
42:22:31/And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.
42:22:32/But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
42:22:33/He replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."
42:22:34/But he said, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."
42:22:35/He asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
42:22:36/Then he said to them, "But now, if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.
42:22:37/For I tell you, what is written must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was counted among the lawbreakers.' Indeed, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."
42:22:38/They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." He replied, "That's enough."
42:22:39/He went out and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
42:22:40/On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."
42:22:41/He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down, and prayed,
42:22:42/"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."
42:22:43/An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
42:22:44/In great anguish, he prayed more fervently, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
42:22:45/When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
42:22:46/He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."
42:22:47/While he was still speaking, a crowd came up, and the man known as Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him.
42:22:48/But Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42:22:49/When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"
42:22:50/And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
42:22:51/But Jesus responded, "Stop! No more of this." And he touched the man's ear and healed him.
42:22:52/Then Jesus said to the chief priests, commanders of the temple guard, and elders who had come for him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?
42:22:53/Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your moment, when darkness reigns."
42:22:54/Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance.
42:22:55/And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.
42:22:56/A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."
42:22:57/But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.
42:22:58/A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.
42:22:59/About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."
42:22:60/Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
42:22:61/The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."
42:22:62/And he went outside and wept bitterly.
42:22:63/The men who were guarding Jesus mocked him and beat him.
42:22:64/They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"
42:22:65/And they said many other insulting things to him.
42:22:66/At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.
42:22:67/"If you are the Christ," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,
42:22:68/and if I asked you, you would not answer.
42:22:69/But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."
42:22:70/They all asked, "So, are you the Son of God?" He replied, "You say that I am."
42:22:71/Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."
42:23:1/And the entire crowd got up and took him to Pilate.
42:23:2/They started accusing him, saying, "We caught this man misleading our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and claiming he is Christ, a King."
42:23:3/And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He replied, "You're saying it."
42:23:4/Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no reason to charge this man."
42:23:5/But they insisted more strongly, "He's causing trouble among the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee to here."
42:23:6/When Pilate heard about Galilee, he asked if the man was from there.
42:23:7/As soon as he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
42:23:8/Herod was extremely pleased to see Jesus; he had wanted to see him for a long time because he had heard a lot about him and hoped to see him perform a miracle.
42:23:9/He asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus didn't answer any of them.
42:23:10/The chief priests and the scribes stood there, vehemently accusing him.
42:23:11/Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt, mocked him, dressed him in an elegant robe, and sent him back to Pilate.
42:23:12/That day, Pilate and Herod became friends; previously, they had been enemies.
42:23:13/And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
42:23:14/Told them, "You brought this man to me as someone who was misleading the people. Yet, after examining him in your presence, I have found no basis for your charges against him.
42:23:15/Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Clearly, he has done nothing to deserve death.
42:23:16/Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."
42:23:17/(It was necessary for him to release one prisoner to them during the festival.)
42:23:18/But they all shouted together, "Get rid of this man and release Barabbas to us!"
42:23:19/(Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion in the city and for murder.)
42:23:20/Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, spoke to them again.
42:23:21/But they kept shouting, "Crucify him, crucify him!"
42:23:22/For the third time he said to them, "Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore, I will have him punished and then release him."
42:23:23/But they kept demanding loudly that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.
42:23:24/So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
42:23:25/He released the man they asked for, who had been imprisoned for insurrection and murder, but he handed Jesus over to their will.
42:23:26/As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and placed the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.
42:23:27/A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.
42:23:28/But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.
42:23:29/For the time is coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'
42:23:30/Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'
42:23:31/For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
42:23:32/Two other criminals were also led out with him to be executed.
42:23:33/When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals, one on his right, the other on his left.
42:23:34/Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
42:23:35/The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is God's Messiah, the Chosen One."
42:23:36/The soldiers also mocked him, coming up to him and offering him sour wine,
42:23:37/And saying, "If you're the king of the Jews, save yourself."
42:23:38/A sign was also placed above him that read, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42:23:39/One of the criminals hanging there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
42:23:40/But the other criminal rebuked him, saying, "Don't you fear God, since you're under the same sentence?
42:23:41/We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."
42:23:42/Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
42:23:43/Jesus answered him, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."
42:23:44/It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,
42:23:45/Because the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
42:23:46/Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.
42:23:47/When the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."
42:23:48/And all the crowds that had gathered for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, beat their breasts and went away.
42:23:49/But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
42:23:50/Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,
42:23:51/Who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God.
42:23:52/This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
42:23:53/He took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut in rock, where no one had ever lain.
42:23:54/It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
42:23:55/The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
42:23:56/Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
42:24:1/On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they went to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared, along with some others.
42:24:2/They discovered the stone had been rolled away from the tomb.
42:24:3/When they went inside, they did not find the body of Lord Jesus.
42:24:4/While they were puzzled about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them.
42:24:5/As they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men asked them, "Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
42:24:6/He is not here; he has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
42:24:7/'The Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, be crucified, and on the third day rise again.'"
42:24:8/Then they remembered his words.
42:24:9/They left the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the others.
42:24:10/It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told the apostles.
42:24:11/But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe them.
42:24:12/Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
42:24:13/That same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42:24:14/They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
42:24:15/As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them.
42:24:16/But they were kept from recognizing him.
42:24:17/He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.
42:24:18/One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
42:24:19/"What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
42:24:20/And how our chief priests and rulers delivered him to be sentenced to death, and crucified him.
42:24:21/But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.
42:24:22/In addition, some women from our group amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning
42:24:23/but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.
42:24:24/Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus."
42:24:25/He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
42:24:26/Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"
42:24:27/And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
42:24:28/As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.
42:24:29/But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.
42:24:30/When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.
42:24:31/Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.
42:24:32/They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"
42:24:33/They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together
42:24:34/and saying, "The Lord has truly risen and has appeared to Simon."
42:24:35/Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
42:24:36/While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
42:24:37/They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.
42:24:38/He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?
42:24:39/Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself. Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."
42:24:40/After he said this, he showed them his hands and feet.
42:24:41/And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
42:24:42/They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
42:24:43/and he took it and ate it in their presence.
42:24:44/He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."
42:24:45/Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures,
42:24:46/and he told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
42:24:47/and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, starting from Jerusalem.
42:24:48/You are witnesses of these things.
42:24:49/And I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."
42:24:50/He led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, raised his hands, and blessed them.
42:24:51/While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.
42:24:52/Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
42:24:53/And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God. Amen.
43:1:1/In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43:1:2/The same was in the beginning with God.
43:1:3/Everything was made through him; and without him, nothing that exists would have been made.
43:1:4/In him was life; and that life was the light of humanity.
43:1:5/And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness did not understand it.
43:1:6/There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
43:1:7/He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe.
43:1:8/He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.
43:1:9/That was the true Light, which enlightens everyone coming into the world.
43:1:10/He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
43:1:11/He came to his own, but his own did not accept him.
43:1:12/But to all who did receive him, he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name:
43:1:13/Who were born, not of blood, nor of the desire of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
43:1:14/And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
43:1:15/John testified about him and shouted, saying, "This is the one I was talking about, the one who comes after me but ranks ahead of me because he existed before me."
43:1:16/From his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace.
43:1:17/For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
43:1:18/No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is close to the Father's heart, has made him known.
43:1:19/This is John's testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
43:1:20/And he confessed, and did not deny; but confessed, "I am not the Messiah."
43:1:21/And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."
43:1:22/Then they said to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
43:1:23/He said, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."
43:1:24/And those who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
43:1:25/And they asked him, "Then why are you baptizing if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
43:1:26/John answered them, "I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know.
43:1:27/He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."
43:1:28/These events took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
43:1:29/The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
43:1:30/This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'
43:1:31/I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was so he might be revealed to Israel."
43:1:32/And John testified, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
43:1:33/I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
43:1:34/I have seen and testify that this is the Son of God."
43:1:35/The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.
43:1:36/And looking at Jesus as he walked by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
43:1:37/When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
43:1:38/Then Jesus turned, saw them following, and asked, "What are you looking for?" They said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"
43:1:39/He replied, "Come and see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent the day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.
43:1:40/One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
43:1:41/He first found his own brother Simon and told him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated the Christ).
43:1:42/And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which is translated Peter).
43:1:43/The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."
43:1:44/Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.
43:1:45/Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43:1:46/And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."
43:1:47/When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit."
43:1:48/Nathanael asked him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
43:1:49/Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
43:1:50/Jesus replied, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that."
43:1:51/He then added, "Truly, I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
43:2:1/On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there.
43:2:2/Both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.
43:2:3/When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother told him, "They have no wine."
43:2:4/Jesus replied, "Woman, why involve me? My time has not yet come."
43:2:5/His mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
43:2:6/There were six stone water jars there, used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.
43:2:7/Jesus told them, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them to the brim.
43:2:8/Then he said, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." And they did so.
43:2:9/When the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom
43:2:10/And said to him, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."
43:2:11/This was the first of the signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
43:2:12/After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.
43:2:13/With the Jewish Passover near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43:2:14/In the temple courts, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.
43:2:15/He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
43:2:16/To those who sold doves, he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a market!"
43:2:17/His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."
43:2:18/The Jews then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"
43:2:19/Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
43:2:20/The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"
43:2:21/But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
43:2:22/After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
43:2:23/While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.
43:2:24/But Jesus did not fully entrust himself to them, because he knew all people.
43:2:25/He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.
43:3:1/There was a man from the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, who was a leader of the Jews.
43:3:2/He came to Jesus at night and said, "Teacher, we know you are a teacher sent from God, because no one could perform the miracles you do unless God were with him."
43:3:3/Jesus replied, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God."
43:3:4/Nicodemus asked, "How can someone be born when they are old? Can they enter their mother's womb a second time to be born?"
43:3:5/Jesus answered, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God."
43:3:6/What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.
43:3:7/Don't be surprised when I say to you, 'You must be born again.'
43:3:8/The wind blows wherever it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you can't tell where it comes from or where it's going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
43:3:9/Nicodemus asked, "How can this be?"
43:3:10/Jesus replied, "You are Israel's teacher, and do you not understand these things?"
43:3:11/Truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
43:3:12/If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?
43:3:13/No one has ascended to heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.
43:3:14/Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
43:3:15/so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
43:3:16/For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.
43:3:17/God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
43:3:18/Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.
43:3:19/And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
43:3:20/For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest their deeds should be exposed.
43:3:21/But whoever lives by the truth comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.
43:3:22/After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized.
43:3:23/John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there, and people were coming and being baptized.
43:3:24/For John had not yet been put in prison.
43:3:25/Then a dispute arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.
43:3:26/They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."
43:3:27/John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven.
43:3:28/You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.'
43:3:29/The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
43:3:30/He must become greater; I must become less."
43:3:31/The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
43:3:32/He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
43:3:33/Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified that God is truthful.
43:3:34/For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.
43:3:35/The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
43:3:36/Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.
43:4:1/So when the Lord found out that the Pharisees had heard about Jesus attracting and baptizing more followers than John,
43:4:2/(Although it was actually his disciples who did the baptizing, not Jesus himself,)
43:4:3/He left Judea and went back to Galilee.
43:4:4/And he had to pass through Samaria on his way.
43:4:5/He arrived at a Samaritan city called Sychar, close to the land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
43:4:6/Jacob's well was there. Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was around noon.
43:4:7/A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus asked her, "Please give me a drink."
43:4:8/(His disciples had gone into the city to buy food.)
43:4:9/The Samaritan woman asked him, "Why are you, a Jew, asking me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?" (Jews usually didn't associate with Samaritans.)
43:4:10/Jesus replied, "If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
43:4:11/The woman said, "Sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where would you get this living water?
43:4:12/Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and livestock?"
43:4:13/Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
43:4:14/but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
43:4:15/The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
43:4:16/Jesus told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."
43:4:17/The woman answered, "I don't have a husband." Jesus said to her, "You're right when you say you don't have a husband.
43:4:18/You've had five husbands, and the man you're with now isn't your husband. You've spoken the truth."
43:4:19/The woman said, "Sir, I can see that you're a prophet.
43:4:20/Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
43:4:21/Jesus told her, "Believe me, dear woman, the time is coming when you won't worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
43:4:22/You Samaritans worship what you don't understand; we worship what we do understand, for salvation comes from the Jews.
43:4:23/Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
43:4:24/God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."
43:4:25/The woman said, "I know that Messiah (called Christ) is coming. When he comes, he'll explain everything to us."
43:4:26/Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you, am he."
43:4:27/Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"
43:4:28/Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the city and said to the people,
43:4:29/"Come, see a man who told me everything I've ever done. Could this be the Messiah?"
43:4:30/They came out of the city and made their way toward him.
43:4:31/Meanwhile, his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."
43:4:32/But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."
43:4:33/Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"
43:4:34/"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.
43:4:35/Don't you say, 'There are still four months until harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
43:4:36/The reaper is already receiving his wages and gathering crops for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper can be glad together.
43:4:37/Here the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true.
43:4:38/I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."
43:4:39/Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."
43:4:40/So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.
43:4:41/And because of his words, many more became believers.
43:4:42/They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."
43:4:43/After the two days, he left for Galilee.
43:4:44/For Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
43:4:45/When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.
43:4:46/Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
43:4:47/When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
43:4:48/Jesus told him, "Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe."
43:4:49/The royal official said, "Sir, please come before my child dies."
43:4:50/Jesus replied, "Go, your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.
43:4:51/While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.
43:4:52/When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him."
43:4:53/Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and his whole household believed.
43:4:54/This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
43:5:1/After this, there was a Jewish festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43:5:2/Now in Jerusalem near the sheep gate, there's a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which has five covered walkways.
43:5:3/Here, many people with disabilities, including the blind, lame, and paralyzed, lay waiting for the water to move.
43:5:4/For at certain times, an angel would come down into the pool and stir up the water. The first person to get in after the water was stirred would be healed of whatever disease they had.
43:5:5/There was a man there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.
43:5:6/When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
43:5:7/The disabled man replied, "Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."
43:5:8/Jesus told him, "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk."
43:5:9/Immediately, the man was healed, picked up his mat, and walked. This happened on the Sabbath.
43:5:10/So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It's the Sabbath; it's not permitted for you to carry your mat."
43:5:11/He replied, "The one who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"
43:5:12/Then they asked him, "Who is the man who told you to pick it up and walk?"
43:5:13/But the healed man didn't know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
43:5:14/Later, Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."
43:5:15/The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43:5:16/Therefore, the Jewish leaders persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him because he had done this on the Sabbath.
43:5:17/But Jesus answered them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working."
43:5:18/For this reason, the Jewish leaders tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
43:5:19/Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees the Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does."
43:5:20/"For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed."
43:5:21/"Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it."
43:5:22/"Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,"
43:5:23/"so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."
43:5:24/"Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life."
43:5:25/"Truly, truly, I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live."
43:5:26/"For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,"
43:5:27/"and he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man."
43:5:28/"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice"
43:5:29/"and come out—those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned."
43:5:30/"By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me."
43:5:31/"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid."
43:5:32/"There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true."
43:5:33/"You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth."
43:5:34/"Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it so that you may be saved."
43:5:35/"John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light."
43:5:36/"But I have testimony greater than John's. The works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me."
43:5:37/"And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,"
43:5:38/"nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent."
43:5:39/"You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,"
43:5:40/"yet you refuse to come to me to have life."
43:5:41/"I do not accept praise from humans."
43:5:42/"But I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you."
43:5:43/"I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him."
43:5:44/"How can you believe when you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?"
43:5:45/"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set."
43:5:46/"If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me."
43:5:47/"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"
43:6:1/After these events, Jesus crossed over the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
43:6:2/A large crowd followed him because they had seen the miracles he performed on those who were sick.
43:6:3/Jesus climbed a mountain and sat there with his disciples.
43:6:4/The Passover, a Jewish festival, was soon to take place.
43:6:5/When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he asked Philip, "Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?"
43:6:6/He asked this to test Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do.
43:6:7/Philip answered, "Even two hundred days' wages worth of bread wouldn't be enough for each person to have a little."
43:6:8/One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
43:6:9/"There's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"
43:6:10/Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, numbering about five thousand.
43:6:11/Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated, as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
43:6:12/When everyone was full, he told his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."
43:6:13/So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
43:6:14/Seeing the sign Jesus had performed, the people said, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."
43:6:15/Realizing they intended to come and make him king by force, Jesus withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
43:6:16/When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
43:6:17/got into a boat, and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
43:6:18/A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
43:6:19/After rowing three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the lake and approaching the boat. They were frightened.
43:6:20/But he said to them, "It's me; don't be afraid."
43:6:21/They were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
43:6:22/The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.
43:6:23/However, other boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
43:6:24/When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
43:6:25/When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"
43:6:26/Jesus answered, "Truly, I tell you, you are looking for me not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
43:6:27/Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."
43:6:28/Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"
43:6:29/Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."
43:6:30/So they asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?
43:6:31/Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
43:6:32/Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
43:6:33/For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
43:6:34/They said to him, "Sir, always give us this bread."
43:6:35/Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
43:6:36/But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
43:6:37/All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
43:6:38/For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of the one who sent me.
43:6:39/And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
43:6:40/For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."
43:6:41/At this, the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
43:6:42/They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"
43:6:43/Jesus answered, "Stop grumbling among yourselves.
43:6:44/No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day.
43:6:45/It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.
43:6:46/Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.
43:6:47/Truly, I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life.
43:6:48/I am the bread of life.
43:6:49/Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
43:6:50/But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.
43:6:51/I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
43:6:52/Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
43:6:53/Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
43:6:54/Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.
43:6:55/For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.
43:6:56/Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.
43:6:57/Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
43:6:58/This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever."
43:6:59/He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
43:6:60/On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?"
43:6:61/Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?
43:6:62/Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?
43:6:63/The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.
43:6:64/Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
43:6:65/He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them."
43:6:66/From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
43:6:67/Then Jesus asked the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?"
43:6:68/Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, who will we go to? You have the words of eternal life.
43:6:69/We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God."
43:6:70/Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil."
43:6:71/He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him.
43:7:1/After these events, Jesus stayed in Galilee because he didn't want to travel in Judea, where the Jewish leaders were looking to kill him.
43:7:2/The Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was coming up.
43:7:3/So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea so your followers can see the miracles you do."
43:7:4/No one does things in secret when they're looking to be known publicly. If you're doing these things, show yourself to the world.
43:7:5/Even his own brothers didn't believe in him.
43:7:6/Then Jesus told them, "My time hasn't arrived yet, but any time works for you.
43:7:7/The world can't hate you, but it hates me because I point out that its actions are evil.
43:7:8/You go to the festival. I'm not going up to this festival yet because my time hasn't fully come."
43:7:9/After saying this, he stayed in Galilee.
43:7:10/But after his brothers had gone to the festival, he also went, not publicly, but in secret.
43:7:11/Then the Jewish leaders were looking for him at the festival and asking, "Where is he?"
43:7:12/There was a lot of private discussion about him among the crowds. Some said, "He's a good man," while others said, "No, he's misleading the people."
43:7:13/However, no one talked about him openly for fear of the Jewish leaders.
43:7:14/About halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began to teach.
43:7:15/The Jewish leaders were amazed and asked, "How does this man have such learning without having been taught?"
43:7:16/Jesus replied, "My teaching isn't my own. It comes from the one who sent me.
43:7:17/If anyone chooses to do God's will, they will know whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.
43:7:18/Anyone who speaks on their own is seeking their own glory, but the one seeking the glory of the one who sent him is true, and there's nothing false in him.
43:7:19/Didn't Moses give you the law, yet none of you keeps the law? Why are you trying to kill me?"
43:7:20/The crowd answered, "You're possessed by a demon! Who's trying to kill you?"
43:7:21/Jesus replied, "I did one miracle, and you're all amazed.
43:7:22/Moses gave you circumcision (not that it came from Moses, but from the patriarchs), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
43:7:23/If a man can receive circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath?
43:7:24/Don't judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."
43:7:25/Some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they're trying to kill?
43:7:26/Yet here he is, speaking publicly, and they're saying nothing to him. Could it be that the leaders really know he is the Messiah?
43:7:27/But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."
43:7:28/Then Jesus, teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I'm from. I haven't come on my own, but the one who sent me is true, and you don't know him.
43:7:29/But I know him because I am from him, and he sent me."
43:7:30/So they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.
43:7:31/Many in the crowd believed in him and said, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?"
43:7:32/The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
43:7:33/Then Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me.
43:7:34/You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."
43:7:35/The Jewish leaders said to one another, "Where does he intend to go that we won't find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
43:7:36/What does he mean by saying, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
43:7:37/On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and drink.
43:7:38/Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them."
43:7:39/(He said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.)
43:7:40/When they heard his words, many in the crowd said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."
43:7:41/Others said, "He is the Messiah." But some asked, "Does the Messiah come from Galilee?
43:7:42/Doesn't Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"
43:7:43/Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.
43:7:44/Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.
43:7:45/Then the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
43:7:46/The officers replied, "No one ever spoke the way this man does."
43:7:47/The Pharisees responded, "Have you been led astray too?
43:7:48/Have any of the leaders or Pharisees believed in him?
43:7:49/But this crowd that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them."
43:7:50/Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,
43:7:51/"Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?"
43:7:52/They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."
43:7:53/And everyone went to their own home.
43:8:1/Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
43:8:2/Early in the morning, he returned to the temple, and all the people came to him; he sat down and began to teach them.
43:8:3/The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery to him; they placed her in front of everyone.
43:8:4/They said to him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
43:8:5/Moses in the law commanded us to stone such women. What do you say?"
43:8:6/They were trying to trap him with this question, so they could have a reason to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with his finger, ignoring them.
43:8:7/When they kept questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
43:8:8/Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground.
43:8:9/Those who heard began to leave one by one, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
43:8:10/When Jesus stood up and saw no one but the woman, he asked her, "Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?"
43:8:11/She replied, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go now and leave your life of sin."
43:8:12/Then Jesus spoke again to the people, saying, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life."
43:8:13/So the Pharisees said to him, "You are testifying about yourself; your testimony is not valid."
43:8:14/Jesus answered, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
43:8:15/You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.
43:8:16/But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.
43:8:17/Your own law also says that the testimony of two people is true.
43:8:18/I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."
43:8:19/Then they asked him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You do not know me or my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."
43:8:20/Jesus spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.
43:8:21/Again Jesus said to them, "I am leaving, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."
43:8:22/The Jews wondered, "Is he going to kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"
43:8:23/He told them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
43:8:24/That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."
43:8:25/They asked him, "Who are you?" Jesus answered, "Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.
43:8:26/I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."
43:8:27/They did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father.
43:8:28/Then Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
43:8:29/The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."
43:8:30/As he was saying these things, many believed in him.
43:8:31/Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
43:8:32/Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
43:8:33/They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves to anyone. How can you say, 'You will be set free'?"
43:8:34/Jesus replied, "Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
43:8:35/A slave does not remain in the household forever, but a son belongs to it forever.
43:8:36/So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
43:8:37/I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.
43:8:38/I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father."
43:8:39/They answered, "Abraham is our father." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, then you would do what Abraham did.
43:8:40/As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
43:8:41/You are doing the works of your own father." They said to him, "We are not illegitimate children; the only Father we have is God himself."
43:8:42/Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
43:8:43/Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
43:8:44/You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
43:8:45/Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.
43:8:46/Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?
43:8:47/Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."
43:8:48/The Jews responded, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"
43:8:49/Jesus answered, "I am not possessed by a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
43:8:50/I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.
43:8:51/Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."
43:8:52/Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'
43:8:53/Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"
43:8:54/Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
43:8:55/You do not know him, but I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.
43:8:56/Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
43:8:57/Then the Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?"
43:8:58/Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham was born, I am."
43:8:59/At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
43:9:1/As Jesus was walking by, he noticed a man who had been blind since birth.
43:9:2/His disciples asked him, "Teacher, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43:9:3/Jesus replied, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so the works of God could be displayed in him.
43:9:4/I must do the works of the one who sent me while it is still day; night is coming when no one can work.
43:9:5/As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43:9:6/After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.
43:9:7/Then he told him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came back able to see.
43:9:8/His neighbors and those who had previously seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"
43:9:9/Some claimed that he was, others said, "No, he just looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."
43:9:10/So they asked him, "Then how were your eyes opened?"
43:9:11/He replied, "The man named Jesus made some mud, put it on my eyes, and told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."
43:9:12/They asked him, "Where is this man?" He said, "I don't know."
43:9:13/They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.
43:9:14/It was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
43:9:15/Then the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He told them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see."
43:9:16/Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner perform such signs?" So they were divided.
43:9:17/They turned again to the blind man, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."
43:9:18/Yet the Jewish leaders did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight.
43:9:19/They asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
43:9:20/His parents answered, "We know this is our son and that he was born blind.
43:9:21/But how he now sees, we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself."
43:9:22/His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Christ would be expelled from the synagogue.
43:9:23/That's why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
43:9:24/So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know this man is a sinner."
43:9:25/He answered, "Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."
43:9:26/Then they asked him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
43:9:27/He replied, "I have already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"
43:9:28/They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
43:9:29/We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from."
43:9:30/The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
43:9:31/We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, God listens to him.
43:9:32/Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
43:9:33/If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
43:9:34/They replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us?" And they threw him out.
43:9:35/Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he asked, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
43:9:36/He answered, "Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"
43:9:37/Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking with you."
43:9:38/He said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.
43:9:39/Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind."
43:9:40/Some Pharisees who were with him heard these words and asked him, "Are we also blind?"
43:9:41/Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.
43:10:1/Truly, truly, I tell you, anyone who doesn't enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a robber.
43:10:2/But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
43:10:3/To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
43:10:4/When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
43:10:5/They will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.
43:10:6/Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.
43:10:7/Then Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.
43:10:8/All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.
43:10:9/I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture.
43:10:10/The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
43:10:11/I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43:10:12/But the hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away—and the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
43:10:13/The hired hand runs away because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.
43:10:14/I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—
43:10:15/just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.
43:10:16/I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
43:10:17/For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life—only to take it up again.
43:10:18/No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.
43:10:19/Therefore the Jews were divided because of these words.
43:10:20/Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and insane. Why listen to him?"
43:10:21/Others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
43:10:22/Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
43:10:23/and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade.
43:10:24/The Jews gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
43:10:25/Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,
43:10:26/but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.
43:10:27/My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
43:10:28/I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.
43:10:29/My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.
43:10:30/I and the Father are one."
43:10:31/Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,
43:10:32/Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"
43:10:33/The Jews replied, "It’s not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
43:10:34/Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are gods’?
43:10:35/If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—
43:10:36/what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?
43:10:37/If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.
43:10:38/But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
43:10:39/Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
43:10:40/Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed,
43:10:41/and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a sign, everything John said about this man was true."
43:10:42/And in that place many believed in Jesus.
43:11:1/A certain man named Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.
43:11:2/(This was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
43:11:3/So his sisters sent a message to Jesus, saying, "Lord, the one you love is sick."
43:11:4/Upon hearing this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death, but is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
43:11:5/Jesus had a deep affection for Martha, her sister, and Lazarus.
43:11:6/Even after hearing that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.
43:11:7/Then he said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea."
43:11:8/His disciples replied, "Teacher, the Jewish leaders were just trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?"
43:11:9/Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime won't stumble because they see the world's light.
43:11:10/But if anyone walks at night, they stumble because the light is not in them."
43:11:11/After saying this, he told them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him up."
43:11:12/The disciples said, "Lord, if he's sleeping, he will get better."
43:11:13/Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought he meant natural sleep.
43:11:14/Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.
43:11:15/And for your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there, so that you may believe. But let's go to him."
43:11:16/Then Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to the rest of the disciples, "Let's also go, so that we may die with him."
43:11:17/When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
43:11:18/Bethany was close to Jerusalem, about two miles away,
43:11:19/and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother.
43:11:20/When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
43:11:21/Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
43:11:22/But I know that even now, whatever you ask from God, God will give you."
43:11:23/Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again."
43:11:24/Martha said to him, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
43:11:25/Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, even if they die, will live,
43:11:26/and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
43:11:27/She replied, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."
43:11:28/After she said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside, whispering, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
43:11:29/As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
43:11:30/Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
43:11:31/The Jews who were with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out. They followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
43:11:32/When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
43:11:33/When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
43:11:34/He asked, "Where have you laid him?" They replied, "Lord, come and see."
43:11:35/Jesus wept.
43:11:36/The Jews then said, "See how much he loved him!"
43:11:37/But some of them said, "Couldn't he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"
43:11:38/Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
43:11:39/Jesus said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days."
43:11:40/Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"
43:11:41/So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
43:11:42/I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe you sent me."
43:11:43/After saying this, he shouted with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
43:11:44/The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."
43:11:45/Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.
43:11:46/But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
43:11:47/Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin and said, "What are we accomplishing? This man is performing many signs.
43:11:48/If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation."
43:11:49/One of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all.
43:11:50/You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."
43:11:51/He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
43:11:52/and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.
43:11:53/So from that day on they plotted to take his life.
43:11:54/Therefore, Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead, he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
43:11:55/The Jewish Passover was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.
43:11:56/They were looking for Jesus and asking each other as they stood in the temple courts, "What do you think? Isn’t he coming to the festival at all?"
43:11:57/The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they could arrest him.
43:12:1/Then Jesus, six days before Passover, arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had brought back to life.
43:12:2/There, they prepared a dinner for him; Martha was serving, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
43:12:3/Mary then took a pound of very expensive spikenard perfume, anointed Jesus' feet, and wiped his feet with her hair. The fragrance of the perfume filled the entire house.
43:12:4/Then Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray him, said,
43:12:5/Why wasn't this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?
43:12:6/He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; he held the money bag and would help himself to what was put into it.
43:12:7/Then Jesus said, Leave her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial.
43:12:8/You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
43:12:9/Many of the Jews knew Jesus was there and came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
43:12:10/But the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus as well,
43:12:11/Because on account of him, many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.
43:12:12/The next day, a large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
43:12:13/They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel who comes in the name of the Lord!"
43:12:14/And Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,
43:12:15/"Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."
43:12:16/At first, his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
43:12:17/The crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
43:12:18/Many people went out to meet him because they had heard he had performed this sign.
43:12:19/So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"
43:12:20/Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.
43:12:21/They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."
43:12:22/Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
43:12:23/Jesus replied, "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43:12:24/Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
43:12:25/Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
43:12:26/If anyone serves me, they must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
43:12:27/"Now my soul is troubled, and what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
43:12:28/Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
43:12:29/The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
43:12:30/Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.
43:12:31/Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.
43:12:32/And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
43:12:33/He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
43:12:34/The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
43:12:35/Then Jesus told them, "You will have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going.
43:12:36/While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light." After Jesus had said this, he went away and hid himself from them.
43:12:37/Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.
43:12:38/This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
43:12:39/For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere,
43:12:40/"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn—and I would heal them."
43:12:41/Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.
43:12:42/Yet at the same time, many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees, they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;
43:12:43/For they loved human praise more than praise from God.
43:12:44/Then Jesus cried out, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.
43:12:45/And whoever sees me sees the one who sent me.
43:12:46/I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
43:12:47/If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
43:12:48/There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.
43:12:49/For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.
43:12:50/And I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.
43:13:1/Before the Passover feast, Jesus, knowing that his time had come to leave this world and go to the Father, showed his love for his followers in the world to the very end.
43:13:2/After dinner, with the devil already prompting Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,
43:13:3/Jesus, aware that the Father had put everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was returning to God,
43:13:4/Got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
43:13:5/Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel wrapped around him.
43:13:6/When he came to Simon Peter, Peter asked him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
43:13:7/Jesus replied, "You don't understand what I'm doing now, but you will later."
43:13:8/Peter insisted, "You will never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no share with me."
43:13:9/Simon Peter then said, "Lord, not just my feet, but also my hands and my head!"
43:13:10/Jesus told him, "Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash their feet to be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you."
43:13:11/For he knew who was going to betray him, which is why he said not everyone was clean.
43:13:12/After washing their feet, putting on his clothes, and returning to his place, he asked them, "Do you understand what I have done for you?
43:13:13/You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.
43:13:14/If I, then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.
43:13:15/I have set an example for you, so that you should do as I have done for you.
43:13:16/Truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than their master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent them.
43:13:17/If you understand these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
43:13:18/I'm not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture: 'The one who shared my bread has turned against me.'
43:13:19/I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe that I am who I am.
43:13:20/Truly, I tell you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."
43:13:21/After saying this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and declared, "Truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me."
43:13:22/The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.
43:13:23/One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved, was reclining close to him.
43:13:24/Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him who he's talking about."
43:13:25/Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
43:13:26/Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it." After dipping the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
43:13:27/After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus then told him, "What you are about to do, do quickly."
43:13:28/None of those at the table understood why Jesus said this to him.
43:13:29/Some thought that, since Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.
43:13:30/As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.
43:13:31/When he had left, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
43:13:32/If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.
43:13:33/My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: where I am going, you cannot come.
43:13:34/A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
43:13:35/By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."
43:13:36/Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."
43:13:37/Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
43:13:38/Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? Truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
43:14:1/Don't let your heart be troubled: if you believe in God, believe also in me.
43:14:2/In my Father's house, there are many places to live: if it weren't true, I would have told you. I'm going to prepare a place for you.
43:14:3/And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back, and take you to be with me; so that where I am, you may be there too.
43:14:4/You know where I'm going, and you know the way.
43:14:5/Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you're going; how can we know the way?"
43:14:6/Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, except through me."
43:14:7/If you had known me, you would have known my Father too: from now on, you do know him, and have seen him.
43:14:8/Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
43:14:9/Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you don't know me, Philip? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father; so how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
43:14:10/Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words I say to you, I don't speak on my own authority: but the Father living in me does his works.
43:14:11/Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me: or else believe because of the works themselves.
43:14:12/Truly, I tell you, anyone who believes in me will do the works I have been doing; and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.
43:14:13/And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
43:14:14/If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
43:14:15/If you love me, keep my commands.
43:14:16/And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever;
43:14:17/The Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot accept, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
43:14:18/I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
43:14:19/Soon the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.
43:14:20/On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
43:14:21/Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.
43:14:22/Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, how is it that you will reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"
43:14:23/Jesus answered him, "If anyone loves me, they will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.
43:14:24/Anyone who does not love me does not keep my words. And the word you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
43:14:25/I have told you these things while I am still with you.
43:14:26/But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have said to you.
43:14:27/Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
43:14:28/You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
43:14:29/And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe.
43:14:30/After this, I won't talk much with you, because the ruler of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,
43:14:31/but the world must learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. Get up, let's go from here.
43:15:1/I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
43:15:2/Every branch in me that does not produce fruit he removes: and every branch that does produce fruit, he prunes so that it will produce even more fruit.
43:15:3/Now you are clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
43:15:4/Remain in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot produce fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine; neither can you unless you remain in me.
43:15:5/I am the vine, you are the branches: Whoever remains in me, and I in them, will produce a lot of fruit: for apart from me you can do nothing.
43:15:6/If anyone does not remain in me, they are thrown out like a branch and wither; and such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.
43:15:7/If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
43:15:8/This is how my Father is glorified, by you bearing much fruit; and in this way, you will be my disciples.
43:15:9/Just as the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue in my love.
43:15:10/If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love; just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love.
43:15:11/I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.
43:15:12/This is my command: Love each other as I have loved you.
43:15:13/No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.
43:15:14/You are my friends if you do what I command.
43:15:15/From now on, I don’t call you servants, because a servant doesn’t know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, for everything that I have learned from my Father I have made known to you.
43:15:16/You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and produce fruit, and that your fruit should last: so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
43:15:17/This is my command to you: Love each other.
43:15:18/If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
43:15:19/If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
43:15:20/Remember what I told you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours as well.
43:15:21/But they will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.
43:15:22/If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
43:15:23/Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.
43:15:24/If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.
43:15:25/But this happened so that the statement written in their law would be fulfilled: 'They hated me without reason.'
43:15:26/But when the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
43:15:27/And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.
43:16:1/I've told you these things so you won't be caught off guard.
43:16:2/You'll be kicked out of the synagogues; indeed, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they're doing a service to God.
43:16:3/They will do these things to you because they don't know the Father or me.
43:16:4/But I've told you this so when the time comes, you'll remember I warned you. I didn't tell you this from the start because I was with you.
43:16:5/But now I'm leaving to go to the one who sent me, and none of you are asking where I'm going.
43:16:6/Yet, because I've told you these things, your hearts are filled with sorrow.
43:16:7/However, I'm telling you the truth; it's better for you that I leave because if I don't, the Comforter won't come to you. But if I go, I'll send him to you.
43:16:8/And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment:
43:16:9/Concerning sin, because they don't believe in me;
43:16:10/Concerning righteousness, because I'm going to the Father and you won't see me anymore;
43:16:11/Concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
43:16:12/I have much more to tell you, but you can't handle it now.
43:16:13/However, when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He won't speak on his own but will tell you what he hears and will show you things to come.
43:16:14/He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and revealing it to you.
43:16:15/Everything that the Father has is mine. That's why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and show it to you.
43:16:16/In a little while, you won't see me anymore, but then after a little while, you will see me, because I am going to the Father.
43:16:17/Then some of his disciples said to each other, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while, you won't see me, and then after a little while, you will see me,' and 'Because I am going to the Father'?"
43:16:18/So they kept asking, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We don't understand what he's saying."
43:16:19/Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you trying to figure out among yourselves what I meant by saying, 'In a little while, you won't see me, and then after a little while, you will see me'?
43:16:20/Truly, I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn into joy.
43:16:21/Just as a woman in labor is in pain because her time has come, but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child has been born into the world.
43:16:22/So you have grief now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.
43:16:23/On that day, you won't need to ask me anything. Truly, I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
43:16:24/Up to now, you haven't asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
43:16:25/I have spoken to you in figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in such a way but will tell you plainly about the Father.
43:16:26/On that day, you will ask in my name. I'm not saying I will ask the Father on your behalf;
43:16:27/For the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
43:16:28/I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father."
43:16:29/His disciples said, "Now you're speaking clearly and without figures of speech.
43:16:30/Now we understand that you know everything and don't need anyone to question you. By this, we believe that you came from God."
43:16:31/Jesus replied, "Do you now believe?
43:16:32/Listen, a time is coming, indeed it's here now, when you will be scattered, each to your own home, leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
43:16:33/I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world, you will have trouble, but take heart; I have overcome the world."
43:17:1/Jesus spoke these words, then looked up to heaven and said, "Father, the time has come; glorify your Son, so that your Son may glorify you:
43:17:2/Since you have given him authority over all people, to give eternal life to all you have given him.
43:17:3/And eternal life is this: to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
43:17:4/I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
43:17:5/And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
43:17:6/I have revealed your name to those you gave me from the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.
43:17:7/Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
43:17:8/For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
43:17:9/I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.
43:17:10/All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.
43:17:11/I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.
43:17:12/While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
43:17:13/I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
43:17:14/I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.
43:17:15/My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.
43:17:16/They are not of the world, just as I am not of it.
43:17:17/Make them holy through your truth; your word is truth.
43:17:18/Just as you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
43:17:19/And for their sake, I consecrate myself, that they too may be truly consecrated.
43:17:20/I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their message,
43:17:21/that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
43:17:22/I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one—
43:17:23/I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
43:17:24/Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
43:17:25/Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.
43:17:26/I have made your name known to them and will continue to make it known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."
43:18:1/After Jesus had said these things, he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden he and his disciples went into.
43:18:2/Judas, the one who would betray him, also knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples.
43:18:3/So Judas, getting a group of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees, approached with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
43:18:4/Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, stepped forward and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"
43:18:5/They replied, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus told them, "I am he." Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
43:18:6/When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.
43:18:7/He asked them again, "Who are you looking for?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
43:18:8/Jesus responded, "I already told you that I am he. So, if you're looking for me, let these others go."
43:18:9/This was to fulfill what he had said, "I have not lost any of those you gave me."
43:18:10/Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
43:18:11/Jesus then said to Peter, "Put your sword back in its place. Shouldn't I drink the cup my Father has given me?"
43:18:12/So the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus and tied him up.
43:18:13/They first took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
43:18:14/Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.
43:18:15/Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. This disciple was known to the high priest and went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard.
43:18:16/But Peter had to stay outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there, and brought Peter in.
43:18:17/Then the servant girl at the door said to Peter, "Aren't you one of this man's disciples?" He said, "I am not."
43:18:18/Now the servants and officials had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
43:18:19/The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teachings.
43:18:20/Jesus answered, "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
43:18:21/Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."
43:18:22/When he said this, one of the officials nearby slapped Jesus in the face, saying, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"
43:18:23/Jesus replied, "If I said something wrong, testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you hit me?"
43:18:24/Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.
43:18:25/As Simon Peter stood warming himself, they asked him, "Aren't you one of his disciples?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."
43:18:26/One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the garden?"
43:18:27/Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
43:18:28/Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's palace. It was early morning, and they did not enter the palace themselves to avoid ceremonial uncleanness, so they could eat the Passover.
43:18:29/So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"
43:18:30/They answered, "If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you."
43:18:31/Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." But the Jews replied, "We are not permitted to execute anyone."
43:18:32/This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.
43:18:33/Then Pilate went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
43:18:34/Jesus replied, "Is that your own idea, or did others talk to you about me?"
43:18:35/Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?"
43:18:36/Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place."
43:18:37/So Pilate asked him, "You are a king, then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
43:18:38/Pilate asked him, "What is truth?" After he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, "I find no basis for a charge against him."
43:18:39/"But you have a custom that I release one prisoner at the Passover. Do you want me to release the king of the Jews?"
43:18:40/They shouted back, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a bandit.
43:19:1/Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him.
43:19:2/The soldiers twisted a crown of thorns, placed it on his head, and dressed him in a purple robe.
43:19:3/They greeted him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and slapped him across the face.
43:19:4/Pilate came out again and said to them, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to make it clear that I find no basis for a charge against him."
43:19:5/So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
43:19:6/When the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate responded, "Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no basis for a charge against him."
43:19:7/The Jews replied, "We have a law, and according to that law, he must die because he claimed to be the Son of God."
43:19:8/When Pilate heard this, he became even more frightened.
43:19:9/He went back inside the palace and asked Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus did not give him an answer.
43:19:10/Pilate then said to him, "Aren't you going to speak to me? Don't you realize I have the power to free you or to crucify you?"
43:19:11/Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore, the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
43:19:12/From then on, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
43:19:13/When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).
43:19:14/It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. He said to the Jews, "Here is your king!"
43:19:15/But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate asked them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
43:19:16/So Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. Then they took Jesus away.
43:19:17/Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).
43:19:18/There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
43:19:19/Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
43:19:20/Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.
43:19:21/The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."
43:19:22/Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
43:19:23/After they crucified Jesus, the soldiers took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
43:19:24/So they said to one another, "Let's not tear it. Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment." So this is what the soldiers did.
43:19:25/Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43:19:26/When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"
43:19:27/and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
43:19:28/After this, Jesus, knowing that everything had now been finished, and to fulfill Scripture, said, "I am thirsty."
43:19:29/A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
43:19:30/When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is completed." Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
43:19:31/Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
43:19:32/The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.
43:19:33/But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
43:19:34/Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.
43:19:35/The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
43:19:36/These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken,"
43:19:37/and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."
43:19:38/Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
43:19:39/Nicodemus, who had first come to Jesus at night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about seventy-five pounds.
43:19:40/They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews.
43:19:41/At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.
43:19:42/Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
43:20:1/On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was still dark and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
43:20:2/She then ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and told them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him."
43:20:3/Peter and the other disciple started out and went toward the tomb.
43:20:4/They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
43:20:5/He bent over and looked in at the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in.
43:20:6/Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there,
43:20:7/and the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head was not lying with the linen wrappings but was folded up in a place by itself.
43:20:8/Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
43:20:9/At that time they still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.
43:20:10/Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.
43:20:11/But Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb
43:20:12/and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
43:20:13/They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She replied, "They have taken my Lord away, and I don't know where they have put him."
43:20:14/After she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
43:20:15/Jesus asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."
43:20:16/Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means "Teacher").
43:20:17/Jesus told her, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
43:20:18/Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.
43:20:19/On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
43:20:20/After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
43:20:21/Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
43:20:22/And with that, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
43:20:23/If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
43:20:24/Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
43:20:25/So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43:20:26/A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
43:20:27/Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
43:20:28/Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"
43:20:29/Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
43:20:30/Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
43:20:31/But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
43:21:1/After these events, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; he revealed himself in this way.
43:21:2/Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were all together.
43:21:3/Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing." They replied, "We'll come with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they didn't catch anything.
43:21:4/But as dawn broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however, the disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.
43:21:5/Then Jesus called out to them, "Friends, do you have any fish?" They answered, "No."
43:21:6/He told them, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you'll find some." So they did, and they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
43:21:7/Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
43:21:8/The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
43:21:9/When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.
43:21:10/Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you've just caught."
43:21:11/Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
43:21:12/Jesus invited them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
43:21:13/Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
43:21:14/This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
43:21:15/After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my lambs."
43:21:16/He then asked him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Shepherd my sheep."
43:21:17/He asked him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."
43:21:18/Truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."
43:21:19/He said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. After saying this, he told him, "Follow me."
43:21:20/Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; this was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had asked, "Lord, who is going to betray you?"
43:21:21/Seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"
43:21:22/Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."
43:21:23/Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"
43:21:24/This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
43:21:25/There are also many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. Amen.
44:1:1/The first account I wrote, O Theophilus, covered everything Jesus began to do and teach,
44:1:2/until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
44:1:3/He also presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and talking about the kingdom of God.
44:1:4/While meeting with them, he instructed them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father's promise, which, he said, "you have heard from me."
44:1:5/John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
44:1:6/So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"
44:1:7/He told them, "It's not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
44:1:8/But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
44:1:9/After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.
44:1:10/As they were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
44:1:11/They said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."
44:1:12/Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city.
44:1:13/When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
44:1:14/They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
44:1:15/During this time, Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)
44:1:16/and said, "Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus.
44:1:17/He was one of our number and shared in our ministry."
44:1:18/This man bought a field with the wages of his wickedness; and falling headfirst, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines spilled out.
44:1:19/This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.
44:1:20/"For," said Peter, "it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, 'May another take his place of leadership.'
44:1:21/Therefore, it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
44:1:22/from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
44:1:23/So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.
44:1:24/Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
44:1:25/to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs."
44:1:26/Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
44:2:1/When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.
44:2:2/Suddenly, a sound like a powerful wind came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting.
44:2:3/They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
44:2:4/All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.
44:2:5/Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
44:2:6/When this sound occurred, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken.
44:2:7/Amazed and astonished, they asked, "Aren't all these people who are speaking Galileans?
44:2:8/Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
44:2:9/People from Parthia, Media, Elam, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
44:2:10/Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts to Judaism),
44:2:11/Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!"
44:2:12/They were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
44:2:13/But some sneered and said, "They've had too much wine."
44:2:14/Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.
44:2:15/These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning!
44:2:16/No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
44:2:17/'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.
44:2:18/Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
44:2:19/I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
44:2:20/The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
44:2:21/And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
44:2:22/Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.
44:2:23/This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
44:2:24/But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
44:2:25/David said about him: 'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
44:2:26/Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope,
44:2:27/because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
44:2:28/You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.'
44:2:29/Brothers and sisters, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
44:2:30/But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
44:2:31/Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.
44:2:32/God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
44:2:33/Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
44:2:34/For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand
44:2:35/until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'
44:2:36/Therefore, let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.
44:2:37/When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
44:2:38/Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44:2:39/The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call."
44:2:40/With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."
44:2:41/Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
44:2:42/They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
44:2:43/Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
44:2:44/All the believers were together and had everything in common.
44:2:45/They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
44:2:46/Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
44:2:47/praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
44:3:1/Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the time of prayer, around three in the afternoon.
44:3:2/There was a man who had been unable to walk since birth, who was carried and placed every day at the temple gate called Beautiful, to ask for money from those entering the temple.
44:3:3/Seeing Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked them for money.
44:3:4/Peter, with John, looked intently at him and said, "Look at us."
44:3:5/He paid attention to them, expecting to get something from them.
44:3:6/Then Peter said, "I don't have silver or gold, but what I do have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk."
44:3:7/Peter took him by the right hand and helped him up. Instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.
44:3:8/He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.
44:3:9/All the people saw him walking and praising God.
44:3:10/They recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.
44:3:11/While the man who had been healed clung to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade.
44:3:12/Seeing this, Peter said to them, "Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
44:3:13/The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go.
44:3:14/You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.
44:3:15/You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.
44:3:16/It is by faith in the name of Jesus that this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.
44:3:17/Now, brothers and sisters, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
44:3:18/But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer.
44:3:19/Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.
44:3:20/And that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.
44:3:21/Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
44:3:22/Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.
44:3:23/Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.'
44:3:24/Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.
44:3:25/You are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your ancestors. He said to Abraham, 'Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.'
44:3:26/When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.
44:4:1/While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees confronted them,
44:4:2/Upset that they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
44:4:3/They arrested them and put them in jail until the next day since it was already evening.
44:4:4/However, many who heard the message believed; and the number of men grew to about five thousand.
44:4:5/The next day, the rulers, elders, and scribes,
44:4:6/Along with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others of the high priest's family, gathered in Jerusalem.
44:4:7/They had them stand in the middle and questioned, "By what power or in what name did you do this?"
44:4:8/Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Leaders of the people and elders of Israel,
44:4:9/If we are being questioned today about a kind act to a disabled man and how he was healed,
44:4:10/Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, this man stands before you healed.
44:4:11/This Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'
44:4:12/And salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."
44:4:13/Seeing the courage of Peter and John and realizing they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
44:4:14/But seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
44:4:15/So they ordered them to leave the council and then discussed the matter among themselves,
44:4:16/Saying, "What shall we do with these men? For it's obvious to all living in Jerusalem that a remarkable miracle has been done through them, and we cannot deny it.
44:4:17/But to stop this from spreading any further among the people, let's warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name."
44:4:18/Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44:4:19/But Peter and John replied, "Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you rather than to God.
44:4:20/As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."
44:4:21/After further threats, they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
44:4:22/For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
44:4:23/On their release, they went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
44:4:24/When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God, "Sovereign Lord, you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.
44:4:25/You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: 'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
44:4:26/The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one.'
44:4:27/Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
44:4:28/To do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
44:4:29/Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness,
44:4:30/Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
44:4:31/After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
44:4:32/The group of believers was of one heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.
44:4:33/With great power, the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all.
44:4:34/There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales,
44:4:35/And put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.
44:4:36/Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement"),
44:4:37/Sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44:5:1/But a man named Ananias, along with his wife Sapphira, sold a property,
44:5:2/And held back part of the money, with his wife's knowledge, and brought only a portion of it and placed it at the apostles' feet.
44:5:3/But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the money from the land?
44:5:4/While you owned it, wasn't it yours to control? And after selling it, wasn't the money at your disposal? Why did you decide to do this? You haven't lied to humans, but to God.
44:5:5/Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. And a deep fear came over everyone who heard about it.
44:5:6/Then the young men got up, wrapped his body, and carried him out and buried him.
44:5:7/About three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44:5:8/And Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?" And she said, "Yes, for that amount."
44:5:9/Then Peter said to her, "Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well."
44:5:10/Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband.
44:5:11/And a great fear came over the whole church and all who heard about these events.
44:5:12/Through the apostles, many signs and wonders were performed among the people; and they were all united in Solomon's Colonnade.
44:5:13/Nobody else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people.
44:5:14/More and more believers in the Lord, crowds of both men and women, were added to their number.
44:5:15/As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.
44:5:16/Crowds also came from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
44:5:17/Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy,
44:5:18/And arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
44:5:19/But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out, saying,
44:5:20/"Go, stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this new life."
44:5:21/At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach. But the high priest and his associates arrived and called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles.
44:5:22/But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported,
44:5:23/"We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
44:5:24/On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what this might lead to.
44:5:25/Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people."
44:5:26/At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, for fear that they might be stoned by the people.
44:5:27/They brought the apostles and made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
44:5:28/"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."
44:5:29/Peter and the other apostles replied: "We must obey God rather than human beings!
44:5:30/The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
44:5:31/God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
44:5:32/And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
44:5:33/When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.
44:5:34/But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.
44:5:35/Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men.
44:5:36/Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.
44:5:37/After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.
44:5:38/So in the present case, I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
44:5:39/But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."
44:5:40/His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
44:5:41/The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.
44:5:42/Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
44:6:1/In those days, as the number of disciples increased, there was a complaint from the Greek-speaking believers against the Hebrew-speaking believers because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
44:6:2/So the twelve summoned the entire group of disciples and said, "It's not right for us to neglect the word of God to handle food distribution."
44:6:3/Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we can appoint to this task.
44:6:4/But we will devote ourselves continuously to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
44:6:5/This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
44:6:6/They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
44:6:7/As a result, the word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
44:6:8/And Stephen, brimming with grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
44:6:9/However, some members of the so-called Synagogue of Freedmen, as well as some from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and Asia, began to argue with Stephen.
44:6:10/But they could not stand up against the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
44:6:11/Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
44:6:12/They stirred up the people, the elders, and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
44:6:13/They also set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.
44:6:14/For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the traditions Moses handed down to us."
44:6:15/Everyone sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw his face was like the face of an angel.
44:7:1/Then the high priest asked, "Is this true?"
44:7:2/He replied, "Listen up, everyone. The glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he moved to Haran,
44:7:3/And told him, 'Leave your homeland and your relatives, and go to the land I will show you.'
44:7:4/So he left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. After his father died, God moved him to this land where you now live.
44:7:5/He didn't give him any property here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised to give it to him and his descendants, even though at that time Abraham had no children.
44:7:6/God explained that Abraham's descendants would live in a foreign land, where they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
44:7:7/'But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out and worship me in this place.'
44:7:8/Then God established the covenant of circumcision with Abraham, and so Abraham had Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
44:7:9/Because of jealousy, the patriarchs sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him,
44:7:10/And rescued him from all his troubles. He granted Joseph favor and wisdom in the eyes of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him as governor over Egypt and his entire household.
44:7:11/Then a famine spread over all Egypt and Canaan, causing great suffering, and our ancestors couldn't find food.
44:7:12/When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there first.
44:7:13/On their second visit, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family.
44:7:14/Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his entire family, seventy-five people in all.
44:7:15/So Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died.
44:7:16/Their bodies were taken back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain amount of money.
44:7:17/As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased.
44:7:18/Until a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
44:7:19/He dealt deceitfully with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to abandon their newborn babies so they would die.
44:7:20/It was at that time Moses was born, a beautiful child in God's eyes. His parents cared for him at home for three months.
44:7:21/When he was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.
44:7:22/Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.
44:7:23/When he was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites.
44:7:24/He saw one of them being mistreated, so he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by killing the Egyptian.
44:7:25/He thought his brothers would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn't understand.
44:7:26/The next day he came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?'
44:7:27/But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who appointed you as our ruler and judge?
44:7:28/Are you going to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
44:7:29/When Moses heard this, he fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.
44:7:30/After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
44:7:31/When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, the Lord's voice called out to him,
44:7:32/Saying, 'I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses trembled and didn't dare to look.
44:7:33/Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44:7:34/I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.'
44:7:35/This Moses, whom they rejected by saying, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' is the one God sent to be both ruler and deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44:7:36/He led them out of Egypt, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and for forty years in the wilderness.
44:7:37/This is the Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people.'
44:7:38/He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and he received living words to pass on to us.
44:7:39/But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,
44:7:40/Saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'
44:7:41/That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They offered sacrifices to it and celebrated what their own hands had made.
44:7:42/But God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the celestial bodies, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?
44:7:43/You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore, I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'
44:7:44/Our ancestors had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern he had seen.
44:7:45/Our ancestors in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors. It remained until the time of David,
44:7:46/Who found favor in God's sight and asked for the privilege of providing a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44:7:47/But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
44:7:48/Yet the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says,
44:7:49/'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me?' says the Lord. 'Or where will my resting place be?
44:7:50/Have not my hands made all these things?'
44:7:51/You stubborn people! You are uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; just as your ancestors did, so do you.
44:7:52/Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—
44:7:53/You who received the law as delivered by angels but have not kept it."
44:7:54/When they heard these things, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.
44:7:55/But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
44:7:56/And said, "Look, I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
44:7:57/Then they shouted loudly, covered their ears, and all rushed at him together,
44:7:58/They dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. The witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44:7:59/As they stoned Stephen, he called out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44:7:60/Then he fell to his knees and cried out loudly, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." After saying this, he passed away.
44:8:1/Saul approved of his death. At that time, there was intense persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
44:8:2/Devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
44:8:3/Meanwhile, Saul was devastating the church, entering house after house, dragging off both men and women to prison.
44:8:4/So those who were scattered went about spreading the word everywhere.
44:8:5/Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them.
44:8:6/The crowds listened intently to Philip, seeing the signs he performed and hearing his message.
44:8:7/Many who were possessed by unclean spirits were freed, with the spirits shouting loudly, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.
44:8:8/And there was immense joy in that city.
44:8:9/However, a man named Simon had previously practiced sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
44:8:10/Everyone from the least to the greatest paid attention to him, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called Great."
44:8:11/They listened to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
44:8:12/But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
44:8:13/Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized, he stayed constantly with Philip, astonished by the great signs and miracles he observed.
44:8:14/When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
44:8:15/They came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
44:8:16/(For the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
44:8:17/Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
44:8:18/When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
44:8:19/Saying, "Give me also this ability so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
44:8:20/But Peter told him, "May your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!"
44:8:21/"You have no part or share in this, because your heart is not right before God."
44:8:22/"Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart."
44:8:23/"For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."
44:8:24/Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."
44:8:25/After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
44:8:26/An angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is deserted."
44:8:27/He got up and went, and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,
44:8:28/And was returning, seated in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah.
44:8:29/The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."
44:8:30/So Philip ran up to it and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked.
44:8:31/"How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
44:8:32/The passage of Scripture he was reading was this: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth."
44:8:33/"In his humiliation, his justice was denied. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth."
44:8:34/The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"
44:8:35/Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
44:8:36/As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. What prevents me from being baptized?"
44:8:37/Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." He replied, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44:8:38/He ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
44:8:39/When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
44:8:40/Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
44:9:1/And Saul, still furiously threatening and planning to kill the Lord's disciples, went to the high priest,
44:9:2/And asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found anyone following this way, whether men or women, he could take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
44:9:3/As he was traveling, he got close to Damascus: and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.
44:9:4/He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
44:9:5/He asked, "Who are you, Lord?" And the Lord replied, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting: it's futile for you to resist me."
44:9:6/Trembling and astonished, he asked, "Lord, what do you want me to do?" The Lord told him, "Get up, and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
44:9:7/The men traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
44:9:8/Saul got up from the ground; but when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anything. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
44:9:9/He was blind for three days and didn't eat or drink anything.
44:9:10/In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."
44:9:11/The Lord told him, "Get up, and go to the street called Straight, and ask in the house of Judas for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. Right now, he is praying,
44:9:12/And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."
44:9:13/But Ananias replied, "Lord, I've heard from many about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.
44:9:14/And he has authority here from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."
44:9:15/But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles, kings, and the people of Israel.
44:9:16/I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."
44:9:17/So Ananias went and entered the house; placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44:9:18/Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up, was baptized,
44:9:19/And after eating, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
44:9:20/Right away he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
44:9:21/Everyone who heard him was astonished and asked, "Isn't this the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?"
44:9:22/But Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
44:9:23/After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,
44:9:24/But Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
44:9:25/But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
44:9:26/When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
44:9:27/But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
44:9:28/So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
44:9:29/He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
44:9:30/When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44:9:31/Then the churches throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had a time of peace and were strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, they increased in numbers.
44:9:32/As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord's people who lived in Lydda.
44:9:33/There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.
44:9:34/Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat." Immediately Aeneas got up.
44:9:35/All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
44:9:36/In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.
44:9:37/About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.
44:9:38/Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, "Please come at once!"
44:9:39/Peter went with them, and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
44:9:40/But Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
44:9:41/He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive.
44:9:42/This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
44:9:43/Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
44:10:1/In Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the Italian Regiment,
44:10:2/He was deeply religious and revered God along with his entire household. He generously helped the needy and always prayed to God.
44:10:3/Around three in the afternoon, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him and calling his name, "Cornelius."
44:10:4/Startled, he asked, "What is it, Lord?" The angel replied, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have ascended as a memorial before God.
44:10:5/Now, send some men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon, who is also called Peter.
44:10:6/He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea."
44:10:7/After the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among his attendants,
44:10:8/and after explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
44:10:9/The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray around noon.
44:10:10/He became very hungry and wanted something to eat. While the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
44:10:11/He saw the sky open and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.
44:10:12/It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds.
44:10:13/Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat."
44:10:14/But Peter said, "Certainly not, Lord! I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."
44:10:15/The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
44:10:16/This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
44:10:17/While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate.
44:10:18/They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
44:10:19/While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Look, three men are looking for you.
44:10:20/So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them."
44:10:21/Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"
44:10:22/They replied, "Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear what you have to say."
44:10:23/So Peter invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he went with them, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.
44:10:24/They arrived in Caesarea the following day. Cornelius was expecting them and had gathered his relatives and close friends.
44:10:25/As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.
44:10:26/But Peter helped him up, saying, "Stand up; I am only a man myself."
44:10:27/Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
44:10:28/He said to them, "You are aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.
44:10:29/So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?"
44:10:30/Cornelius answered, "Four days ago, I was praying in my house at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly, a man in shining clothes stood before me
44:10:31/and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered before God.
44:10:32/Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.'
44:10:33/So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us."
44:10:34/Then Peter began to speak: "I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism
44:10:35/but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.
44:10:36/You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
44:10:37/You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached—
44:10:38/how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
44:10:39/We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,
44:10:40/but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
44:10:41/He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44:10:42/He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.
44:10:43/All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
44:10:44/While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
44:10:45/The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.
44:10:46/For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,
44:10:47/"Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have."
44:10:48/So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
44:11:1/The apostles and believers in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted God's message.
44:11:2/When Peter arrived in Jerusalem, those who were circumcised argued with him,
44:11:3/They said, "You went into the homes of uncircumcised men and ate with them."
44:11:4/But Peter explained the situation from the start, detailing it step by step to them, saying,
44:11:5/"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance, I saw a vision. A large sheet was being lowered from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.
44:11:6/When I looked closely, I saw four-footed animals, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the sky.
44:11:7/Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.'
44:11:8/But I replied, 'Certainly not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
44:11:9/But the voice from heaven spoke again, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'
44:11:10/This happened three times, and then everything was pulled back up into heaven.
44:11:11/Right then, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying.
44:11:12/The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.
44:11:13/He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, saying, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
44:11:14/He will bring you a message through which you and your entire household will be saved.'
44:11:15/As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them, just as on us at the beginning.
44:11:16/Then I remembered what the Lord had said: 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44:11:17/So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God's way?"
44:11:18/When they heard this, they stopped objecting and praised God, saying, "So then, God has also granted the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life."
44:11:19/Those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews.
44:11:20/Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
44:11:21/The Lord's hand was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
44:11:22/News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44:11:23/When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
44:11:24/He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
44:11:25/Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
44:11:26/and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year, Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
44:11:27/During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44:11:28/One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)
44:11:29/The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea.
44:11:30/This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
44:12:1/Around that time, King Herod aggressively targeted members of the church.
44:12:2/He executed James, the brother of John, by the sword.
44:12:3/Seeing that this pleased the Jewish leaders, he went on to arrest Peter as well. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
44:12:4/After capturing him, Herod put Peter in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, planning to present him to the public after Passover.
44:12:5/Meanwhile, Peter was held in prison, but the church was fervently praying to God for him.
44:12:6/On the night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.
44:12:7/Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side to wake him up and said, "Quick, get up!" And the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.
44:12:8/The angel told him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." Peter did so, and the angel said, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
44:12:9/Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.
44:12:10/They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened for them by itself. They went through it, and when they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.
44:12:11/Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."
44:12:12/After this realization, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.
44:12:13/When Peter knocked at the outer entrance, a servant named Rhoda came to answer.
44:12:14/Recognizing Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening the gate and exclaimed, "Peter is at the door!"
44:12:15/They told her, "You're out of your mind." But she kept insisting that it was so. They said, "It must be his angel."
44:12:16/Meanwhile, Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were amazed.
44:12:17/Motioning to them with his hand to be quiet, he described how the Lord had led him out of prison. "Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this," he said, and then he left for another place.
44:12:18/At dawn, there was a great commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
44:12:19/After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
44:12:20/Herod was furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon; but they came to him in a united front, and having secured the support of Blastus, the king’s personal aide, they asked for peace because their regions depended on the king’s country for food.
44:12:21/On the appointed day, Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to them.
44:12:22/The people shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man."
44:12:23/Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44:12:24/But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
44:12:25/Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem after completing their mission, taking with them John, also known as Mark.
44:13:1/In the church at Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers, including Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
44:13:2/While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart Barnabas and Saul for the mission I have called them to."
44:13:3/After they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them off.
44:13:4/So, being sent by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus.
44:13:5/When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their assistant.
44:13:6/As they traveled through the island to Paphos, they encountered a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew named Barjesus,
44:13:7/who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. He called for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
44:13:8/But Elymas the sorcerer (which is what his name means) opposed them, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
44:13:9/Then Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at him
44:13:10/and said, "You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness! Will you never stop perverting the true ways of the Lord?
44:13:11/Now, the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind, and for a time you will not see the light of the sun." Immediately mist and darkness fell on him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
44:13:12/When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
44:13:13/After leaving Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them to return to Jerusalem.
44:13:14/But they went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath, they entered the synagogue and sat down.
44:13:15/After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a message of encouragement for the people, please speak."
44:13:16/Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said, "Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me.
44:13:17/The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt, and with mighty power he led them out of that country.
44:13:18/For about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness.
44:13:19/He overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance.
44:13:20/All this took about 450 years. After that, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
44:13:21/Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
44:13:22/After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.'
44:13:23/From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised.
44:13:24/Before Jesus came, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.
44:13:25/As John was completing his work, he said: 'Who do you think I am? I am not the one. No, but he is coming after me, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.'
44:13:26/Fellow children of Abraham and all of you who fear God, this message of salvation has been sent to us.
44:13:27/The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him, they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
44:13:28/Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
44:13:29/When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
44:13:30/But God raised him from the dead,
44:13:31/and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
44:13:32/We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors
44:13:33/he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: 'You are my Son; today I have become your Father.'
44:13:34/In fact, regarding his resurrection from the dead, never to decay, he has spoken in this way: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'
44:13:35/So it is also stated elsewhere: 'You will not let your Holy One see decay.'
44:13:36/For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, died, was buried with his ancestors, and his body decayed.
44:13:37/But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
44:13:38/Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
44:13:39/Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.
44:13:40/Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:
44:13:41/'Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.'
44:13:42/As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
44:13:43/When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44:13:44/On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44:13:45/But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.
44:13:46/Then Paul and Barnabas answered boldly: "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
44:13:47/For this is what the Lord has commanded us: 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
44:13:48/When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
44:13:49/The word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region.
44:13:50/But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.
44:13:51/So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.
44:13:52/And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44:14:1/In Iconium, they both went into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke so effectively that a large number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
44:14:2/However, the Jews who did not believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the believers.
44:14:3/So, they spent a considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders.
44:14:4/But the city was divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.
44:14:5/When an attack was planned against them by both Gentiles and Jews, along with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them,
44:14:6/they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region,
44:14:7/where they continued to preach the gospel.
44:14:8/In Lystra, there was a man who couldn't use his feet, crippled from birth, who had never walked.
44:14:9/This man listened to Paul speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed,
44:14:10/and called out, "Stand up on your feet!" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.
44:14:11/When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"
44:14:12/They called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker.
44:14:13/The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he wanted to offer sacrifices with the crowds.
44:14:14/But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,
44:14:15/"Friends, why are you doing this? We are just humans like you, and we are telling you to turn away from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.
44:14:16/In the past, he let all nations go their own way.
44:14:17/Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."
44:14:18/Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
44:14:19/Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
44:14:20/But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
44:14:21/After preaching the gospel in that city and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
44:14:22/strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God," they said.
44:14:23/When they had appointed elders for them in each church and had prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
44:14:24/After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.
44:14:25/And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
44:14:26/From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
44:14:27/On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
44:14:28/And they spent a considerable time with the disciples.
44:15:1/Some men from Judea came and taught the believers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved."
44:15:2/So when Paul and Barnabas had a significant disagreement and debate with them, it was decided that Paul and Barnabas, along with some other believers, should go to Jerusalem to discuss this issue with the apostles and elders.
44:15:3/With the church's support, they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, sharing the news of the Gentiles converting, which brought great joy to all the believers.
44:15:4/Upon arriving in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported everything God had done through them.
44:15:5/However, some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses."
44:15:6/The apostles and elders met to consider this matter.
44:15:7/After much discussion, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
44:15:8/God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
44:15:9/He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.
44:15:10/Now then, why do you test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?
44:15:11/But we believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that we are saved, just as they are."
44:15:12/The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
44:15:13/When they finished, James spoke up, "Brothers, listen to me.
44:15:14/Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.
44:15:15/The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written,
44:15:16/'After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,
44:15:17/so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things—
44:15:18/things known from long ago.
44:15:19/It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
44:15:20/Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.
44:15:21/For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."
44:15:22/Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers.
44:15:23/They sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.
44:15:24/We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
44:15:25/So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul—
44:15:26/men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44:15:27/Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
44:15:28/It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:
44:15:29/You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.
44:15:30/So the messengers were sent off and went to Antioch, where they gathered the congregation and delivered the letter.
44:15:31/When they read it, they were glad for its encouraging message.
44:15:32/Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.
44:15:33/After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.
44:15:34/However, Silas decided to stay there.
44:15:35/Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.
44:15:36/Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing."
44:15:37/Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.
44:15:38/But Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
44:15:39/They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
44:15:40/while Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.
44:15:41/He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44:16:1/Then he arrived in Derbe and Lystra, and there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was Greek.
44:16:2/He was well spoken of by the believers in Lystra and Iconium.
44:16:3/Paul wanted Timothy to join him on his journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jewish people in those areas, who all knew that his father was Greek.
44:16:4/As they traveled from city to city, they shared the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to follow.
44:16:5/And so, the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew in numbers every day.
44:16:6/After traveling through Phrygia and Galatia, they were prevented by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in Asia.
44:16:7/When they reached Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit did not allow them.
44:16:8/So, bypassing Mysia, they went down to Troas.
44:16:9/That night, Paul had a vision of a man from Macedonia begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
44:16:10/After seeing the vision, we immediately tried to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
44:16:11/Setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis,
44:16:12/and from there to Philippi, a leading city of that part of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We stayed in this city for several days.
44:16:13/On the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began speaking to the women who had gathered there.
44:16:14/One of the women listening was named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what Paul was saying.
44:16:15/After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, "If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.
44:16:16/As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a lot of profit by fortune-telling.
44:16:17/She followed Paul and us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved."
44:16:18/She kept doing this for many days. Finally, Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!" And it came out at that very moment.
44:16:19/When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities,
44:16:20/and they brought them before the magistrates, saying, "These men are Jews, and are causing trouble in our city,
44:16:21/and are advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice."
44:16:22/The crowd joined in the attack against them, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
44:16:23/After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
44:16:24/Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44:16:25/About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
44:16:26/Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone's chains came loose.
44:16:27/The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
44:16:28/But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"
44:16:29/The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
44:16:30/He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44:16:31/They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household."
44:16:32/Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
44:16:33/At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.
44:16:34/The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.
44:16:35/When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: "Release those men."
44:16:36/The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace."
44:16:37/But Paul said to the officers: "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."
44:16:38/The officers reported this to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.
44:16:39/So they came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.
44:16:40/After leaving the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they saw and encouraged the brothers and sisters, then they left.
44:17:1/After traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they arrived in Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44:17:2/Paul, as was his custom, went to them, and for three Sabbath days engaged in discussions with them, using the scriptures,
44:17:3/Explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Messiah.
44:17:4/Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, including a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.
44:17:5/But the Jews who were not persuaded became jealous and gathered some troublemakers from the marketplace to form a mob and start a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas, to bring them out to the crowd.
44:17:6/Not finding them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting, "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,
44:17:7/and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They all defy Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, Jesus."
44:17:8/This caused a disturbance among the people and the city officials who heard this.
44:17:9/After securing bail from Jason and the others, they let them go.
44:17:10/That very night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. Upon arriving, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
44:17:11/The Bereans were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, eagerly accepting the message and examining the scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
44:17:12/As a result, many of them believed, including a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
44:17:13/But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea, they went there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
44:17:14/At once, the believers sent Paul to the coast, while Silas and Timothy stayed behind.
44:17:15/Those escorting Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
44:17:16/While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
44:17:17/So he debated in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.
44:17:18/Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods," because he was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
44:17:19/They took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said, "Can we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
44:17:20/You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean."
44:17:21/(All the Athenians and the foreigners living there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
44:17:22/Then Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
44:17:23/As I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So what you worship as something unknown, I am going to proclaim to you.
44:17:24/The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.
44:17:25/And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
44:17:26/From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.
44:17:27/God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.
44:17:28/'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'
44:17:29/Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill.
44:17:30/In the past, God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
44:17:31/For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead."
44:17:32/When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject."
44:17:33/So Paul left the council.
44:17:34/Some people joined him and believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
44:18:1/After these events, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth;
44:18:2/And met a Jew named Aquila, originally from Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome:) and he joined them.
44:18:3/Since he shared the same profession, he stayed with them and worked together, as they were tentmakers by trade.
44:18:4/He engaged in discussions in the synagogue every Sabbath, convincing both Jews and Greeks.
44:18:5/When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul felt compelled by the Spirit and declared to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
44:18:6/But when they resisted and insulted him, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads; I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
44:18:7/He then moved on and stayed at the home of a man named Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
44:18:8/Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
44:18:9/One night, the Lord said to Paul in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but keep on speaking and do not be silent.
44:18:10/For I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city."
44:18:11/And he stayed there for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
44:18:12/While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united against Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
44:18:13/Claiming, "This man is persuading people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."
44:18:14/Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If this were a matter of wrongdoing or serious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.
44:18:15/But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law, deal with it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these matters."
44:18:16/And he dismissed them from the tribunal.
44:18:17/Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio showed no concern for any of this.
44:18:18/Paul stayed on for a while longer, then said goodbye to the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.
44:18:19/Upon arriving in Ephesus, he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and engaged in discussion with the Jews.
44:18:20/When they asked him to stay longer, he declined.
44:18:21/But he left them with a promise, "I will come back to you if it's God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44:18:22/When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to greet the church and then went down to Antioch.
44:18:23/After spending some time there, he left and traveled systematically through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44:18:24/A Jew named Apollos, from Alexandria, an eloquent speaker and well-versed in the Scriptures, arrived in Ephesus.
44:18:25/He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being passionate in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
44:18:26/He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
44:18:27/When he wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. Upon arriving, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
44:18:28/For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
44:19:1/It happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the upper regions and arrived at Ephesus, where he found some disciples.
44:19:2/He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They replied, "We haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44:19:3/So he asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?" They answered, "John's baptism."
44:19:4/Paul explained, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
44:19:5/Upon hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44:19:6/When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
44:19:7/There were about twelve men in all.
44:19:8/Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.
44:19:9/But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44:19:10/This went on for two years, so that all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.
44:19:11/God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,
44:19:12/so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
44:19:13/Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, "In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out."
44:19:14/Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
44:19:15/But one day the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I recognize, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"
44:19:16/Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
44:19:17/When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
44:19:18/Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done.
44:19:19/A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.
44:19:20/In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
44:19:21/After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also."
44:19:22/He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.
44:19:23/About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.
44:19:24/A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there.
44:19:25/He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: "You know, gentlemen, that we earn a good income from this business.
44:19:26/And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all.
44:19:27/There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty."
44:19:28/When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44:19:29/Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together.
44:19:30/Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.
44:19:31/Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.
44:19:32/The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.
44:19:33/The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and he motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.
44:19:34/But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44:19:35/The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: "Fellow Ephesians, doesn't everyone know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?
44:19:36/Since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash.
44:19:37/You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
44:19:38/If then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.
44:19:39/If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.
44:19:40/As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it."
44:19:41/After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
44:20:1/After the commotion had settled, Paul gathered the disciples, hugged them, and set off for Macedonia.
44:20:2/Traveling through those regions and offering a lot of encouragement, he arrived in Greece,
44:20:3/Where he stayed for three months. When the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
44:20:4/Joining him on the journey to Asia were Sopater from Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
44:20:5/These men went ahead and waited for us at Troas.
44:20:6/We left Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread and met them in Troas five days later, where we stayed for a week.
44:20:7/On the first day of the week, when we gathered to break bread, Paul spoke to the group, intending to leave the next day, and he kept talking until midnight.
44:20:8/The room upstairs where we were meeting was brightly lit with many lamps.
44:20:9/A young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep while Paul was speaking. Overcome by sleep, he fell from the third story and was picked up dead.
44:20:10/Paul went down, threw his arms around him, and said, "Don't be alarmed; he's alive!"
44:20:11/After going back upstairs, breaking bread, and eating, Paul talked a long while, until dawn, and then left.
44:20:12/They brought the young man back alive and were greatly comforted.
44:20:13/We went ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, planning to pick up Paul there. That was his arrangement since he intended to go on foot.
44:20:14/When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene.
44:20:15/We sailed from there and arrived opposite Chios the next day. The following day we crossed to Samos, and the day after that we arrived at Miletus.
44:20:16/Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia. He was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
44:20:17/From Miletus, he sent a message to Ephesus, calling for the elders of the church.
44:20:18/When they arrived, he said to them, "You know how I lived among you from the first day I arrived in Asia,
44:20:19/Serving the Lord with all humility, through tears and trials that came to me because of the Jews' plots.
44:20:20/I didn't hold back anything that was beneficial to you. I taught you publicly and from house to house,
44:20:21/Emphasizing repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ to both Jews and Greeks.
44:20:22/And now, compelled by the Spirit, I'm going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
44:20:23/Except that the Holy Spirit warns me in every city that imprisonment and hardships are waiting for me.
44:20:24/But I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.
44:20:25/And now, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see my face again.
44:20:26/Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all people.
44:20:27/For I haven't hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
44:20:28/So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
44:20:29/I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
44:20:30/Even from your own number, men will arise and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them.
44:20:31/So be alert and remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
44:20:32/Now I commit you to God and to the message of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
44:20:33/I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.
44:20:34/You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.
44:20:35/In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44:20:36/After he said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
44:20:37/They all wept openly and hugged Paul,
44:20:38/Grieving most of all because of his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.
44:21:1/After we left them and set sail, we went directly to Coos, then to Rhodes the next day, and from there to Patara.
44:21:2/Finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we boarded and set off.
44:21:3/When we spotted Cyprus, we left it on our left side and sailed to Syria, landing at Tyre because the ship needed to unload its cargo there.
44:21:4/We found some disciples and stayed with them for seven days. They, through the Spirit, advised Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
44:21:5/After spending those days, we left and continued on our journey; everyone, including wives and children, escorted us out of the city. We knelt down on the shore and prayed.
44:21:6/After saying goodbye to each other, we boarded the ship, and they went back home.
44:21:7/Completing our voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, greeted the brothers and sisters, and stayed with them for one day.
44:21:8/The next day, Paul's group and I left and went to Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.
44:21:9/This man had four daughters who were virgins and had the gift of prophecy.
44:21:10/While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44:21:11/When he arrived, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet, and said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.'"
44:21:12/When we heard this, we and the local believers begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
44:21:13/Paul responded, "Why are you crying and breaking my heart? I'm not only prepared to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44:21:14/When he wouldn't be convinced, we gave up and said, "Let the Lord's will be done."
44:21:15/After those days, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
44:21:16/Some disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.
44:21:17/Upon our arrival in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters welcomed us warmly.
44:21:18/The next day, Paul and we went to see James, and all the elders were present.
44:21:19/After greeting them, Paul detailed what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44:21:20/When they heard it, they praised God and said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.
44:21:21/They have been informed about you—that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or follow our customs.
44:21:22/What should we do? They will definitely hear that you've come.
44:21:23/So do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow.
44:21:24/Take these men, join in their purification rites, and pay their expenses so they can shave their heads. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.
44:21:25/As for the Gentile believers, we have already written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality."
44:21:26/Then Paul took the men, and the next day, he purified himself along with them and went into the temple to give notice of the completion of the purification days, until the offering was made for each of them.
44:21:27/When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd, and seized him,
44:21:28/Shouting, "Fellow Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this place. He has even brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place."
44:21:29/(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)
44:21:30/The whole city was in an uproar, and the people came running from all directions. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.
44:21:31/While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that all Jerusalem was in chaos.
44:21:32/He immediately took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44:21:33/The commander came up, arrested Paul, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He then asked who he was and what he had done.
44:21:34/Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another, and because of the uproar, the commander couldn't get the facts, so he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.
44:21:35/As Paul reached the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,
44:21:36/For the mob of people followed, shouting, "Get rid of him!"
44:21:37/As Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" The commander replied, "Do you speak Greek?
44:21:38/Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led four thousand terrorists out into the desert?"
44:21:39/But Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people."
44:21:40/With the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people. When they were all silent, he spoke to them in Aramaic, saying,
44:22:1/Men, brothers, and fathers, listen to my defense that I now present to you.
44:22:2/(And when they realized he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they became even more silent: and he said,)
44:22:3/I am truly a man who is a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, but raised in this city under the tutelage of Gamaliel, educated in the strict tradition of our ancestors' law, and fervent for God, just as all of you are today.
44:22:4/And I aggressively persecuted this movement to the point of death, arresting and imprisoning both men and women.
44:22:5/As the high priest and all the council of elders can attest, from whom I also received letters to the brothers, and went to Damascus to bring those who were there in chains back to Jerusalem to be punished.
44:22:6/And as I was on my way, approaching Damascus around noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me.
44:22:7/And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
44:22:8/And I replied, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
44:22:9/And those who were with me saw the light for sure and were terrified, but they did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.
44:22:10/And I asked, 'What should I do, LORD?' And the Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything you are destined to do.'
44:22:11/And because I couldn't see due to the brilliance of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and I arrived in Damascus.
44:22:12/And a man named Ananias, devout according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews living there,
44:22:13/Came to me, stood by me, and said, 'Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And at that very moment, I looked up at him.
44:22:14/And he said, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear words from his mouth.
44:22:15/For you will be his witness to everyone about what you have seen and heard.
44:22:16/And now, why delay? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'
44:22:17/And it happened that, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance;
44:22:18/And saw him telling me, 'Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'
44:22:19/And I said, 'Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you in every synagogue;
44:22:20/And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was being shed, I was also there, approving of his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.'
44:22:21/And he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'
44:22:22/And they listened to him up to this point, and then they raised their voices, saying, 'Get rid of such a person from the earth; it's not right for him to live.'
44:22:23/And as they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and tossing dust into the air,
44:22:24/The commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks and directed that he be interrogated under whipping, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.
44:22:25/And as they tied him up with straps, Paul said to the centurion standing there, 'Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't been convicted?'
44:22:26/When the centurion heard this, he went and reported to the commander, saying, 'Be careful what you do, for this man is a Roman citizen.'
44:22:27/Then the commander came and asked him, 'Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?' He said, 'Yes.'
44:22:28/And the commander replied, 'I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money.' And Paul said, 'But I was born a citizen.'
44:22:29/Immediately, those who were about to interrogate him withdrew, and the commander was also afraid after realizing that he was a Roman citizen and because he had bound him.
44:22:30/The next day, wanting to know the exact reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him from his chains and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to convene, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
44:23:1/Paul, looking intently at the council, said, "Fellow men, I have lived with a clear conscience before God up to this day."
44:23:2/Then the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to hit him on the mouth.
44:23:3/Paul then said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you violate the law by ordering me to be struck!"
44:23:4/Those standing nearby asked, "Are you insulting God’s high priest?"
44:23:5/Paul replied, "I didn't realize, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, 'You must not speak evil of the leader of your people.'"
44:23:6/But noticing that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul shouted in the council, "Fellow men, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead."
44:23:7/When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44:23:8/For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge all these.
44:23:9/Then a loud outcry ensued, and some of the scribes from the Pharisees' side stood up and argued, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
44:23:10/As the dispute became more violent, the commander was afraid Paul might be torn apart by them, so he ordered the troops to go down, take him by force, and bring him into the barracks.
44:23:11/The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage, Paul. Just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, you must also testify in Rome."
44:23:12/When daylight came, some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
44:23:13/There were more than forty who formed this plot.
44:23:14/They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul."
44:23:15/Now then, you and the council must inform the commander to bring Paul down to you tomorrow, as if you were going to examine his case more thoroughly. But before he gets here, we are ready to kill him."
44:23:16/When Paul’s nephew heard about the ambush, he went into the barracks and told Paul.
44:23:17/Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him."
44:23:18/So he took him to the commander and said, "The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."
44:23:19/The commander took him by the hand, stepped aside, and asked privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
44:23:20/He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, pretending they want to inquire more thoroughly about him."
44:23:21/But don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have sworn not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and they are ready now, waiting for your consent."
44:23:22/The commander then let the young man go, instructing him, "Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me."
44:23:23/He called two of his centurions and ordered, "Get ready 200 soldiers, 70 horsemen, and 200 spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight."
44:23:24/"Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and ensure his safe arrival to Governor Felix."
44:23:25/And he wrote a letter as follows:
44:23:26/Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greetings.
44:23:27/This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I arrived with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44:23:28/And wanting to know why they were accusing him, I brought him to their council.
44:23:29/I found that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but was not charged with anything deserving death or imprisonment.
44:23:30/When I was informed of a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state their case against him before you. Farewell.
44:23:31/Then the soldiers, following their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
44:23:32/The next day they let the horsemen go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.
44:23:33/When they arrived at Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul before him.
44:23:34/After reading the letter, the governor asked which province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,
44:23:35/he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers arrive." And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s Praetorium.
44:24:1/And after five days Ananias the high priest arrived with the elders, and a certain speaker named Tertullus, who presented their case against Paul to the governor.
44:24:2/And when he was summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Thanks to you, we enjoy great peace, and your leadership has brought significant benefits to our nation,
44:24:3/We always welcome this, in every place, most noble Felix, with deep gratitude.
44:24:4/However, to avoid taking up too much of your time, I request that you kindly listen to us briefly out of your goodwill.
44:24:5/For we have discovered this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among Jews all over the world, and he's a leading figure in the sect of the Nazarenes:
44:24:6/He even tried to desecrate the temple; we arrested him and wanted to judge him by our law.
44:24:7/But commander Lysias came, forcefully took him from us,
44:24:8/And ordered his accusers to come to you: by examining him yourself, you can verify all these accusations we bring against him.
44:24:9/And the Jews also agreed, affirming that these things were true.
44:24:10/Then Paul, after the governor signaled for him to speak, responded, "Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense:
44:24:11/Because you can verify that it has only been twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
44:24:12/And they did not find me arguing with anyone in the temple, nor inciting a crowd, neither in the synagogues nor anywhere in the city:
44:24:13/Nor can they prove the charges they now bring against me.
44:24:14/But I do admit to you that I worship the God of my ancestors according to the way they call a sect, believing everything laid down by the law and written in the prophets:
44:24:15/And I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
44:24:16/In this belief, I strive to always maintain a clear conscience before God and people.
44:24:17/Now after many years, I returned to bring gifts for my people and to offer sacrifices.
44:24:18/While I was doing this, some Jews from Asia found me in the temple, cleansed, without any crowd or disturbance.
44:24:19/They should have been here before you to make their accusations if they had anything against me.
44:24:20/Or else, let these here present say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,
44:24:21/Except for this one statement I shouted while standing among them, 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"
44:24:22/And when Felix heard these things, having a better understanding of the Way, he postponed the proceedings and said, "When commander Lysias comes down, I will decide your case."
44:24:23/He ordered a centurion to guard Paul but to allow him some freedom and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs.
44:24:24/And after a few days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ.
44:24:25/As Paul discussed righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, "You may leave for now; when I find the time, I will summon you."
44:24:26/He also hoped that Paul would offer him money for his release, which is why he sent for him frequently to talk.
44:24:27/But after two years, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix, and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul in prison.
44:25:1/Now when Festus arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem three days later.
44:25:2/Then the high priest and the Jewish leaders presented their case against Paul to him, pleading for action,
44:25:3/They requested a favor against him, asking that he be summoned to Jerusalem, planning to ambush and kill him on the way.
44:25:4/But Festus replied that Paul would be kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would be going there soon.
44:25:5/"Therefore," he said, "let those among you who are capable, accompany me and present your accusations against him if there is any wrongdoing."
44:25:6/After spending more than ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea; the following day, he took his seat on the judgment bench and ordered that Paul be brought in.
44:25:7/When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, bringing numerous serious charges against him, which they couldn't substantiate.
44:25:8/Paul defended himself by saying, "I have not committed any offense against the Jewish law, the temple, or even against Caesar."
44:25:9/However, Festus, wanting to please the Jews, asked Paul, "Would you be willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?"
44:25:10/Paul responded, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I should be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.
44:25:11/If I am guilty of anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing to their accusations, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."
44:25:12/Then Festus, after discussing it with his council, replied, "You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go."
44:25:13/Some days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
44:25:14/After they had been there for several days, Festus presented Paul's case to the king, saying, "There is a man left in prison by Felix:
44:25:15/About whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a judgment against him.
44:25:16/I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before the accused meets the accusers face to face and has an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges.
44:25:17/So when they came here, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought in.
44:25:18/When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected:
44:25:19/Instead, they had some disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died, but whom Paul claimed was alive.
44:25:20/Because I was uncertain about how to investigate these matters, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these issues.
44:25:21/But when Paul appealed to be held for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar."
44:25:22/Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear this man myself." "Tomorrow," Festus replied, "you will hear him."
44:25:23/The next day, Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great ceremony and entered the auditorium with the high-ranking military officers and prominent men of the city. At Festus's command, Paul was brought in.
44:25:24/And Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man whom the whole Jewish community has petitioned me about, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he should not be allowed to live any longer.
44:25:25/But I found he had done nothing deserving death, and since he himself has appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
44:25:26/However, I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore, I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this examination, I might have something to write.
44:25:27/For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.
44:26:1/Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself." So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:
44:26:2/"I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, to be able to present my case before you today regarding all the accusations the Jews have made against me.
44:26:3/Especially since I know you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44:26:4/All the Jews know how I have lived since my youth, spending my early years among my own people in Jerusalem.
44:26:5/They have known me for a long time and could testify, if they were willing, that I lived as a Pharisee, adhering strictly to our religion's most rigorous sect.
44:26:6/And now I am on trial because of my hope in the promise God made to our ancestors,
44:26:7/a promise our twelve tribes hope to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. It is because of this hope, King Agrippa, that I am accused by the Jews.
44:26:8/Why should it be considered unbelievable by you that God raises the dead?
44:26:9/I once believed I should do everything in my power to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44:26:10/And that is exactly what I did in Jerusalem. Authorized by the chief priests, I imprisoned many of the saints, and when they were executed, I cast my vote against them.
44:26:11/I frequently punished them in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme. Driven by extreme hostility towards them, I even pursued them to foreign cities.
44:26:12/On one such journey to Damascus, with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
44:26:13/at midday, O king, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions.
44:26:14/We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It's hard for you to kick against the goads.'
44:26:15/I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44:26:16/But get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you as a servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you.
44:26:17/I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them
44:26:18/to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
44:26:19/Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
44:26:20/Instead, I first proclaimed to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance.
44:26:21/For these reasons, the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
44:26:22/But with God's help, I have stood firm to this day, testifying to both small and great, saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen:
44:26:23/that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring light to our people and to the Gentiles."
44:26:24/As he made his defense, Festus exclaimed loudly, "Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you insane."
44:26:25/But Paul replied, "I am not insane, most excellent Festus. I am speaking the sober truth.
44:26:26/The king is familiar with these matters, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, for it was not done in a corner.
44:26:27/King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do."
44:26:28/Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You almost persuade me to become a Christian."
44:26:29/Paul replied, "I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains."
44:26:30/When he had finished speaking, the king stood up, as did the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them.
44:26:31/After they left the room, they began saying to one another, "This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment."
44:26:32/Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44:27:1/When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who was part of Augustus' regiment.
44:27:2/Boarding a ship from Adramyttium, we set sail, planning to travel along the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
44:27:3/The next day we stopped at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, allowing him to visit his friends and refresh himself.
44:27:4/After leaving there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
44:27:5/After navigating the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra, a city in Lycia.
44:27:6/There, the centurion found a ship from Alexandria heading to Italy and put us on board.
44:27:7/After sailing slowly for many days and barely making it past Cnidus because the wind was against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
44:27:8/With difficulty, we sailed past it and arrived at a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
44:27:9/After spending a lot of time there, and with sailing becoming dangerous because the Fast was already over, Paul warned them,
44:27:10/"Gentlemen, I can see that this voyage is going to end in disaster and heavy loss, not just of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
44:27:11/However, the centurion trusted the ship's captain and owner more than what Paul said.
44:27:12/And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, most decided to set sail from there, hoping somehow to reach Phoenix, a harbor in Crete facing southwest and northwest, to spend the winter.
44:27:13/When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had achieved their goal, so they weighed anchor and sailed along the coast of Crete.
44:27:14/But not long after, a violent wind, called the Northeaster, struck.
44:27:15/When the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave up and let it be driven along.
44:27:16/Running under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we had difficulty securing the ship's boat.
44:27:17/After hoisting it aboard, they used supports to reinforce the ship. Fearing they might run aground on the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along.
44:27:18/As we were violently battered by the storm, the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard,
44:27:19/And on the third day, with our own hands, we threw the ship's gear overboard.
44:27:20/When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
44:27:21/After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete; then you would have avoided this damage and loss.
44:27:22/But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
44:27:23/For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me,
44:27:24/And said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'
44:27:25/So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
44:27:26/However, we must run aground on some island."
44:27:27/On the fourteenth night, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
44:27:28/They took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep. A little later, they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep.
44:27:29/Fearing we might crash into the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.
44:27:30/In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let down the lifeboat into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
44:27:31/Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved."
44:27:32/So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
44:27:33/Just before dawn, Paul urged everyone to eat, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense and without food, having eaten nothing.
44:27:34/So I urge you to take some food. It will help you survive. Not a hair of your head will be lost."
44:27:35/After he said this, he took some bread, gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat.
44:27:36/They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.
44:27:37/In all, there were 276 of us on the ship.
44:27:38/After they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
44:27:39/When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
44:27:40/After cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
44:27:41/But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground; the bow stuck fast and would not move, while the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
44:27:42/The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.
44:27:43/But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,
44:27:44/And the rest to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way, everyone reached land safely.
44:28:1/After escaping, we realized the island was called Melita.
44:28:2/The local people showed us incredible kindness; they started a fire and welcomed all of us because it was raining and cold.
44:28:3/When Paul was gathering sticks and put them on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, bit his hand.
44:28:4/Seeing the snake hanging from his hand, the locals thought, "Surely this man is a murderer. Even though he survived the sea, divine justice won't let him live."
44:28:5/But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and wasn't hurt.
44:28:6/They expected him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
44:28:7/Nearby lived the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed and hosted us warmly for three days.
44:28:8/Publius' father was sick with fever and dysentery. Paul visited him, prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.
44:28:9/After this, others on the island with diseases came and were healed.
44:28:10/They honored us greatly, and when we were ready to leave, they provided us with everything we needed.
44:28:11/Three months later, we set sail on a ship from Alexandria that had wintered on the island, marked by the figures of Castor and Pollux.
44:28:12/Arriving at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
44:28:13/Then we set sail again and reached Rhegium. The next day, a south wind carried us to Puteoli in a day.
44:28:14/There, we found fellow believers who asked us to stay with them for seven days. Then we headed towards Rome.
44:28:15/When the believers in Rome heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and The Three Taverns. Seeing them, Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
44:28:16/Upon our arrival in Rome, the centurion handed the prisoners over to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier guarding him.
44:28:17/Three days later, Paul called together the local Jewish leaders. He said to them, "Brothers, although I've done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
44:28:18/The Romans, after examining me, wanted to release me because there was no reason for me to be executed.
44:28:19/But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar—not that I had any charge to bring against my own people.
44:28:20/That's why I've asked to see you and talk with you. It's because of the hope of Israel that I'm bound with this chain."
44:28:21/They replied, "We haven't received any letters from Judea about you, nor has anyone who's come reported or said anything bad about you.
44:28:22/But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are speaking against this sect."
44:28:23/They set a day to meet with him, and many came to his lodging. From morning till evening, he explained and testified about the kingdom of God, trying to convince them about Jesus through the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
44:28:24/Some were convinced by what he said, but others did not believe.
44:28:25/When they couldn't agree among themselves, they left after Paul had made one statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet,
44:28:26/saying, 'Go to this people and say, "You will hear but never understand; you will see but never perceive."
44:28:27/For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.'
44:28:28/So know this: God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen."
44:28:29/After he said this, the Jews left, arguing vigorously among themselves.
44:28:30/Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house, welcoming all who came to see him,
44:28:31/proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.
45:1:1/Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
45:1:2/(Which he had promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
45:1:3/Regarding his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born from the lineage of David according to the flesh;
45:1:4/And was proven to be the Son of God with power, in line with the spirit of holiness, through the resurrection from the dead:
45:1:5/Through whom we have received grace and the role of apostles, to promote obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
45:1:6/Among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ:
45:1:7/To all in Rome, loved by God, called to be holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
45:1:8/First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being talked about all over the world.
45:1:9/For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that I constantly remember you in my prayers without fail;
45:1:10/Praying that, if it is God's will, I may at last succeed in coming to you.
45:1:11/For I long to see you, so that I may share with you some spiritual gift, so that you may be strengthened;
45:1:12/That is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
45:1:13/I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that I have often planned to come to you (but have been prevented until now) in order to have some fruit among you, just as among the other Gentiles.
45:1:14/I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
45:1:15/So I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome as well.
45:1:16/For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes; first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.
45:1:17/For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, "The righteous shall live by faith."
45:1:18/For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness;
45:1:19/Because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God has shown it to them.
45:1:20/For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
45:1:21/Because although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
45:1:22/Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
45:1:23/And exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.
45:1:24/Therefore, God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves:
45:1:25/Who exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
45:1:26/For this reason, God gave them over to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;
45:1:27/And in the same way also the men, abandoning natural relations with women, were inflamed with lust for one another; men committing shameful acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
45:1:28/And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what should not be done;
45:1:29/They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, greed, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,
45:1:30/Slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
45:1:31/Without understanding, covenant breakers, heartless, ruthless.
45:1:32/Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
45:2:1/So, you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others. Because in passing judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things.
45:2:2/But we are confident that God's judgment is based on truth against those who do such things.
45:2:3/Do you think, then, that you can judge those who do such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape God's judgment?
45:2:4/Or do you look down on the wealth of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
45:2:5/But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
45:2:6/He will repay each person according to what they have done:
45:2:7/To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.
45:2:8/But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.
45:2:9/Trouble and distress will come upon every human being who does evil, first to the Jew, then to the Gentile;
45:2:10/But glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
45:2:11/For God does not show favoritism.
45:2:12/All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
45:2:13/It is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
45:2:14/Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.
45:2:15/They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.
45:2:16/This will take place on the day when God judges people's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
45:2:17/Now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast about your relationship with God,
45:2:18/And know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;
45:2:19/If you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,
45:2:20/An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
45:2:21/You then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
45:2:22/You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
45:2:23/You who boast about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
45:2:24/As it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
45:2:25/Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.
45:2:26/So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
45:2:27/The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
45:2:28/A person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
45:2:29/No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God.
45:3:1/So, what advantage does being Jewish have? Or what's the benefit of circumcision?
45:3:2/There's a lot of advantage in every way. Most importantly, because the Jews were entrusted with the messages of God.
45:3:3/So what if some didn't believe? Does their disbelief nullify God's faithfulness?
45:3:4/Absolutely not: indeed, let God be recognized as truthful, and every person as a liar; as it is stated, "So that you may be proved right in your words and prevail when you are judged."
45:3:5/But if our wrongdoing highlights the righteousness of God, what can we say? Is God unjust to inflict wrath? (I'm speaking in human terms)
45:3:6/Of course not: for then how could God judge the world?
45:3:7/If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness to his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?
45:3:8/And why not say (as we are wrongly accused and as some claim we say), "Let's do bad things so that good may result"? Their condemnation is deserved.
45:3:9/So, are we any better? Not at all. We have already made the case that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin;
45:3:10/As it is written, "No one is righteous, not even one;
45:3:11/No one understands, no one seeks God.
45:3:12/All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."
45:3:13/"Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive." "The venom of snakes is under their lips."
45:3:14/"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."
45:3:15/"Their feet are quick to shed blood;
45:3:16/Destruction and misery follow them;
45:3:17/And they do not know the way of peace."
45:3:18/"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45:3:19/Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
45:3:20/Therefore, no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
45:3:21/But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been made known, witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
45:3:22/This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,
45:3:23/For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
45:3:24/And are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
45:3:25/God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—
45:3:26/He did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
45:3:27/Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith.
45:3:28/So we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
45:3:29/Is God only the God of the Jews? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles too,
45:3:30/Since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
45:3:31/Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
45:4:1/What then can we say Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, discovered?
45:4:2/For if Abraham was justified by actions, he had something to boast about, but not before God.
45:4:3/What does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
45:4:4/Now to the one who works, the wages are not considered a gift, but something owed.
45:4:5/But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who justifies the wicked, their faith is credited as righteousness.
45:4:6/Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works,
45:4:7/Saying, "Blessed are those whose wrongdoings are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
45:4:8/Blessed is the person whom the Lord will not count their sin against.
45:4:9/Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.
45:4:10/How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised.
45:4:11/And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them as well,
45:4:12/And the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45:4:13/For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
45:4:14/For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is void,
45:4:15/Because the law brings wrath, and where there is no law there is no transgression.
45:4:16/Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring, not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all,
45:4:17/As it is written: "I have made you a father of many nations." He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.
45:4:18/Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
45:4:19/Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah's womb was also dead.
45:4:20/Yet he did not waver through disbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
45:4:21/Being fully convinced that God had the power to do what he had promised.
45:4:22/This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."
45:4:23/Now the words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,
45:4:24/But also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45:4:25/He was handed over to die because of our sins, and was raised to life for our justification.
45:5:1/So, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
45:5:2/Through him, we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we celebrate in hope of the glory of God.
45:5:3/And not only that, but we also take pride in our troubles, knowing that trouble produces endurance.
45:5:4/And endurance produces character, and character produces hope.
45:5:5/And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
45:5:6/For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
45:5:7/It's rare that someone would die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die.
45:5:8/But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
45:5:9/Now that we are justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him.
45:5:10/For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life.
45:5:11/And not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45:5:12/Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.
45:5:13/For before the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged against anyone's account where there is no law.
45:5:14/Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.
45:5:15/But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
45:5:16/Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.
45:5:17/For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
45:5:18/Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.
45:5:19/For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
45:5:20/The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,
45:5:21/so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45:6:1/So, what should we say? Should we keep sinning so that grace can increase?
45:6:2/Absolutely not. How can we, who have died to sin, continue to live in it?
45:6:3/Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
45:6:4/So, we were buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the Father's glory, we too can live a new life.
45:6:5/If we've been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
45:6:6/Understanding that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
45:6:7/Because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
45:6:8/Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
45:6:9/Knowing that Christ, once raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has control over him.
45:6:10/For the death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
45:6:11/In the same way, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45:6:12/Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires.
45:6:13/Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
45:6:14/For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under the law but under grace.
45:6:15/What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not.
45:6:16/Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?
45:6:17/But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance.
45:6:18/And having been set free from sin, you have become slaves to righteousness.
45:6:19/I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.
45:6:20/When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
45:6:21/What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
45:6:22/But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
45:6:23/For the payment for sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45:7:1/Don't you know, my friends (I'm speaking to those who understand the law), that the law has authority over a person as long as they are alive?
45:7:2/A woman who has a husband is legally bound to him while he's alive; but if her husband dies, she's released from the law concerning her husband.
45:7:3/So, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she's considered an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she's free from that law, and she's not an adulteress if she marries another man.
45:7:4/Therefore, my friends, you too have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you can belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might produce fruit for God.
45:7:5/When we were living in our natural state, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our bodies, resulting in death.
45:7:6/But now we have been released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.
45:7:7/What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Absolutely not. However, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what it is to desire what is not mine if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."
45:7:8/But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.
45:7:9/I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.
45:7:10/The very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
45:7:11/For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
45:7:12/So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.
45:7:13/Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
45:7:14/We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
45:7:15/I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do, but what I hate, I do.
45:7:16/If I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
45:7:17/As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
45:7:18/For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
45:7:19/For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.
45:7:20/Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
45:7:21/So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
45:7:22/For in my inner being I delight in God's law;
45:7:23/But I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.
45:7:24/What a miserable person I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
45:7:25/I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
45:8:1/So now, there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't live according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
45:8:2/Because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.
45:8:3/What the law couldn't do, because it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, to deal with sin, and condemned sin in the flesh.
45:8:4/This was so the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who don't live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
45:8:5/Those who live according to the flesh focus on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit focus on what the Spirit desires.
45:8:6/To be controlled by the flesh is death, but to be controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.
45:8:7/The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
45:8:8/Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
45:8:9/But you are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
45:8:10/But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
45:8:11/And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.
45:8:12/So then, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but it's not to the flesh, to live according to it.
45:8:13/For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
45:8:14/For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
45:8:15/You did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."
45:8:16/The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
45:8:17/And if we're children, then we're heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
45:8:18/I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
45:8:19/For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
45:8:20/For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
45:8:21/that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.
45:8:22/We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
45:8:23/Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies.
45:8:24/For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
45:8:25/But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
45:8:26/In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.
45:8:27/And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God.
45:8:28/And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
45:8:29/For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
45:8:30/And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
45:8:31/What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
45:8:32/He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
45:8:33/Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
45:8:34/Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
45:8:35/Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
45:8:36/As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered."
45:8:37/No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45:8:38/For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
45:8:39/neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45:9:1/I'm speaking the truth in Christ, I'm not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit.
45:9:2/I have deep sadness and unending sorrow in my heart.
45:9:3/I could even wish to be cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, my ethnic kin.
45:9:4/They are Israelites; they have the adoption, the divine glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship of God, and the promises.
45:9:5/They are the descendants of the patriarchs, and from them, by physical descent, came Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.
45:9:6/But it's not as though God's word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are truly Israel.
45:9:7/Nor because they are Abraham's descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, "Through Isaac will your offspring be reckoned."
45:9:8/This means that it's not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but the children of the promise are regarded as Abraham's offspring.
45:9:9/For this is the word of promise: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son."
45:9:10/And not only that, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,
45:9:11/before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God's purpose in election might stand, not by works but by him who calls—
45:9:12/she was told, "The older will serve the younger."
45:9:13/Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45:9:14/What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? Absolutely not.
45:9:15/For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45:9:16/So then, it depends not on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy.
45:9:17/For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
45:9:18/Therefore, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
45:9:19/You might say to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"
45:9:20/But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? "Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'"
45:9:21/Doesn't the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?
45:9:22/What if God, wanting to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction?
45:9:23/And what if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—
45:9:24/even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
45:9:25/As he says in Hosea: "I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one,"
45:9:26/and, "In the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'children of the living God.'"
45:9:27/Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
45:9:28/For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality."
45:9:29/Just as Isaiah had previously said, "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah."
45:9:30/What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;
45:9:31/but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained to that law.
45:9:32/Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone."
45:9:33/As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame."
45:10:1/My deepest wish and prayer to God for Israel is for them to be saved.
45:10:2/I acknowledge their enthusiasm for God, but it's not based on true understanding.
45:10:3/They don't understand God's way of making people right with himself, and instead try to establish their own, they haven't embraced God's righteousness.
45:10:4/Christ brings the pursuit of the law to an end, so that everyone who believes can be made right with God.
45:10:5/Moses writes about getting right with God by following the law, saying that anyone who does these things will live by them.
45:10:6/But the righteousness that comes from faith says, "Don't think in your heart, 'Who will go up to heaven?'" (meaning to bring Christ down)
45:10:7/Or, "Who will go down into the deep?" (meaning to bring Christ back from the dead).
45:10:8/But what does it say? "The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart." That is the message of faith we proclaim.
45:10:9/If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45:10:10/Believing with your heart leads to being made right with God, and openly declaring your faith leads to salvation.
45:10:11/The scripture says, "Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame."
45:10:12/There's no difference between Jew and Gentile - the same Lord is Lord of all and generously blesses all who call on him.
45:10:13/Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
45:10:14/But how can they call on him if they don't believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they've never heard about him? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
45:10:15/And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
45:10:16/But not everyone has obeyed the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
45:10:17/So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.
45:10:18/But I ask, haven't they heard? Indeed they have; "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world."
45:10:19/But I ask, didn't Israel understand? First Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding."
45:10:20/And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me."
45:10:21/But regarding Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
45:11:1/I say then, Has God rejected his people? Absolutely not. For I too am an Israelite, descended from Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
45:11:2/God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel, saying,
45:11:3/Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me.
45:11:4/But what is God's response to him? I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
45:11:5/In the same way, at this present time, there is a remnant chosen by grace.
45:11:6/And if it is by grace, then it is no longer based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.
45:11:7/What then? Israel did not obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,
45:11:8/As it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.
45:11:9/And David says, May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
45:11:10/May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.
45:11:11/I say then, Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, through their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
45:11:12/Now if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater will their full inclusion be!
45:11:13/For I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry
45:11:14/in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
45:11:15/For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
45:11:16/If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
45:11:17/If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,
45:11:18/do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.
45:11:19/You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."
45:11:20/Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble.
45:11:21/For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
45:11:22/Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
45:11:23/And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
45:11:24/For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
45:11:25/I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
45:11:26/And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
45:11:27/And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
45:11:28/As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
45:11:29/for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.
45:11:30/Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,
45:11:31/so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.
45:11:32/For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
45:11:33/Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
45:11:34/For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his advisor?
45:11:35/Or who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?
45:11:36/For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
45:12:1/I urge you, my friends, by the compassion of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, pure, pleasing to God—this is your logical act of worship.
45:12:2/Don't conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by renewing your mind, so you can discover what is good, pleasing, and perfect in God's will.
45:12:3/For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone among you, not to think of himself more highly than he should; but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith God has assigned.
45:12:4/Just as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function,
45:12:5/So we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.
45:12:6/Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;
45:12:7/If service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in teaching;
45:12:8/The one who encourages, in encouragement; the one who contributes, with generosity; the one who leads, with diligence; the one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
45:12:9/Let love be genuine. Hate what is evil; hold fast to what is good.
45:12:10/Show genuine affection to one another with brotherly love; outdo one another in showing honor.
45:12:11/Don't be lazy in your work; be fervent in spirit; serve the Lord.
45:12:12/Be joyful in hope; patient in affliction; faithful in prayer.
45:12:13/Share with the saints in their needs; pursue hospitality.
45:12:14/Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
45:12:15/Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.
45:12:16/Have the same regard for one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited.
45:12:17/Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.
45:12:18/If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
45:12:19/Beloved, do not take revenge, but leave room for God's wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," says the Lord.
45:12:20/Therefore, if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.
45:12:21/Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45:13:1/Everyone should submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of power have been placed there by God.
45:13:2/So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will bring judgment on themselves.
45:13:3/For rulers are not a threat to those who do right, but to those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.
45:13:4/For the one in authority is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for they do not wield the sword for no reason. They are God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
45:13:5/Therefore, it is necessary to submit to authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
45:13:6/This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.
45:13:7/Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
45:13:8/Don't owe anyone anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
45:13:9/The commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."
45:13:10/Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.
45:13:11/And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
45:13:12/The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45:13:13/Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
45:13:14/But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.
45:14:1/Welcome those who are weak in faith, but not for the purpose of arguing over doubtful issues.
45:14:2/Some believe they can eat anything, while others, who are weak, eat only vegetables.
45:14:3/Those who eat everything must not look down on those who do not, and those who do not eat everything must not judge those who do, for God has welcomed them.
45:14:4/Who are you to judge someone else's servant? Whether they stand or fall is up to their own master. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
45:14:5/Some people consider one day more sacred than another; others consider every day alike. Each person should be fully convinced in their own mind.
45:14:6/Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.
45:14:7/For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone.
45:14:8/Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this reason, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.
45:14:9/Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
45:14:10/So, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.
45:14:11/It is written: "As surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God."
45:14:12/So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
45:14:13/Therefore, let's stop judging each other. Instead, decide not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.
45:14:14/I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.
45:14:15/If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died.
45:14:16/Therefore, do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil.
45:14:17/For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45:14:18/Anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
45:14:19/Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
45:14:20/Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
45:14:21/It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.
45:14:22/Keep the faith you have between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn themselves by what they approve.
45:14:23/But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
45:15:1/We who are strong should help carry the burdens of those who are not, and not just live to please ourselves.
45:15:2/Each of us should aim to please our neighbors for their benefit, to build them up.
45:15:3/For even Christ didn't live to please Himself. Instead, as the scripture says, "The insults of those who insulted you fell on me."
45:15:4/Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
45:15:5/May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,
45:15:6/So that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45:15:7/Therefore, welcome each other, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.
45:15:8/Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to the Jews on behalf of God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the ancestors,
45:15:9/And so that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy. As it is written: "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the praises of your name."
45:15:10/Again, it says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people."
45:15:11/And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol Him."
45:15:12/And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in Him the Gentiles will hope."
45:15:13/May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
45:15:14/And I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.
45:15:15/However, I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me
45:15:16/To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45:15:17/Therefore I have reason to boast about my work for God through Jesus Christ in what pertains to God.
45:15:18/For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—
45:15:19/By the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
45:15:20/It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.
45:15:21/But as it is written: "Those who were not told about Him will see, and those who have not heard will understand."
45:15:22/That is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
45:15:23/But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you,
45:15:24/Whenever I go to Spain, I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.
45:15:25/But now I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints.
45:15:26/For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
45:15:27/They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.
45:15:28/So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
45:15:29/And I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
45:15:30/I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
45:15:31/Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the saints there,
45:15:32/So that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.
45:15:33/May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45:16:1/I recommend to you our sister Phoebe, who serves the church in Cenchrea.
45:16:2/Welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and help her with anything she needs from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.
45:16:3/Say hello to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus.
45:16:4/They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
45:16:5/Also, greet the church that meets at their house. Give my greetings to my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Achaia.
45:16:6/Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.
45:16:7/Say hello to Andronicus and Junia, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
45:16:8/Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
45:16:9/Say hello to Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
45:16:10/Say hello to Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
45:16:11/Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
45:16:12/Say hello to Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
45:16:13/Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.
45:16:14/Say hello to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers and sisters with them.
45:16:15/Say hello to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.
45:16:16/Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.
45:16:17/I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.
45:16:18/For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
45:16:19/Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
45:16:20/And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
45:16:21/Timothy, my co-worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, send you their greetings.
45:16:22/I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45:16:23/Gaius, who is hosting me and the whole church, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.
45:16:24/May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
45:16:25/Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,
45:16:26/But now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith,
45:16:27/To the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
46:1:1/Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Sosthenes our brother,
46:1:2/To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be holy, along with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:
46:1:3/May grace and peace be yours, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
46:1:4/I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Jesus Christ.
46:1:5/That in every way you have been enriched by Him, in all speech and all knowledge.
46:1:6/Just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you.
46:1:7/So that you are not lacking in any gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46:1:8/He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46:1:9/God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
46:1:10/Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
46:1:11/For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers and sisters, by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you.
46:1:12/What I mean is that each one of you says, "I follow Paul," or "I follow Apollos," or "I follow Cephas," or "I follow Christ."
46:1:13/Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
46:1:14/I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
46:1:15/So no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
46:1:16/I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.
46:1:17/For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
46:1:18/For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
46:1:19/For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart."
46:1:20/Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn't God made the wisdom of the world foolish?
46:1:21/For since in the wisdom of God the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.
46:1:22/For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
46:1:23/But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,
46:1:24/But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
46:1:25/Because the foolishness of God is wiser than humans, and the weakness of God is stronger than humans.
46:1:26/Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
46:1:27/But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
46:1:28/God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,
46:1:29/So that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
46:1:30/But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
46:1:31/So that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
46:2:1/And I, friends, when I came to you, did not come with superior speech or wisdom, sharing with you the testimony of God.
46:2:2/For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
46:2:3/And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
46:2:4/And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
46:2:5/So that your faith would not be based on human wisdom, but on the power of God.
46:2:6/However, we do speak wisdom among those who are mature: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing:
46:2:7/But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God predestined before the ages for our glory:
46:2:8/Which none of the rulers of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
46:2:9/But as it is written, "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined the things which God has prepared for those who love him."
46:2:10/But God has revealed them to us through his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
46:2:11/For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
46:2:12/Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand the things freely given to us by God.
46:2:13/Which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.
46:2:14/But the person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
46:2:15/But the person who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one.
46:2:16/For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
46:3:1/And I, friends, couldn't speak to you as if you were spiritually mature, but rather as if you were worldly, just like infants in Christ.
46:3:2/I've given you milk to drink, not solid food, because until now you weren't ready for it, and even now you still aren't ready.
46:3:3/You are still worldly. For when there is jealousy, quarreling, and division among you, doesn't that show you are worldly and behaving like ordinary people?
46:3:4/When one of you says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you acting like mere humans?
46:3:5/So, who is Paul, and who is Apollos? They are servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned to each his task.
46:3:6/I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.
46:3:7/So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.
46:3:8/The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor.
46:3:9/For we are co-workers in God's service; you are God's field, God's building.
46:3:10/By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.
46:3:11/For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
46:3:12/Now if anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
46:3:13/each one's work will become clear, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test the quality of each person's work.
46:3:14/If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.
46:3:15/If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.
46:3:16/Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?
46:3:17/If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
46:3:18/Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become "fools" so that you may become wise.
46:3:19/For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness."
46:3:20/And again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile."
46:3:21/So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,
46:3:22/whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,
46:3:23/and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
46:4:1/Consider us as Christ's servants and stewards of God's mysteries.
46:4:2/It's essential for stewards to be found trustworthy.
46:4:3/For me, it's not significant if I'm judged by you or by any human court; I don't even judge myself.
46:4:4/I'm not aware of anything against myself, but that doesn't mean I'm justified. The Lord is the one who judges me.
46:4:5/So, don't pass judgment prematurely, before the Lord returns. He will bring to light what's hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the heart. Then, each person will receive praise from God.
46:4:6/I've applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so you can learn from us not to think of people more highly than you ought, to prevent rivalry among you.
46:4:7/What makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you didn't receive? If you did receive it, why do you boast as though you didn't?
46:4:8/Now you're satisfied, now you're wealthy, you've become kings without us. I wish you really had become kings so we could reign with you.
46:4:9/I think God has presented us apostles last, as if sentenced to death, because we've become a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to humans.
46:4:10/We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honored, but we are dishonored.
46:4:11/Right up to this moment, we are hungry, thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and homeless.
46:4:12/We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;
46:4:13/when we are slandered, we respond kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world, right up to this moment.
46:4:14/I'm not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.
46:4:15/Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you don't have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
46:4:16/Therefore, I urge you to imitate me.
46:4:17/That's why I've sent Timothy to you, my beloved and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which aligns with what I teach everywhere in every church.
46:4:18/Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.
46:4:19/But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not the talk of those who are arrogant but their power.
46:4:20/For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.
46:4:21/What do you prefer? Should I come to you with a rod, or with love and a gentle spirit?
46:5:1/It's widely known that there's sexual immorality among you, and such immorality that isn't even mentioned among non-believers, that someone is involved with his stepmother.
46:5:2/And you're arrogant instead of mourning, so that the person who did this could be removed from your community.
46:5:3/For I, although not physically present but with you in spirit, have already passed judgment on the one who did this, as if I were there.
46:5:4/In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
46:5:5/To hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that their spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord Jesus.
46:5:6/Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?
46:5:7/So clean out the old yeast, so that you may be a new batch, as you are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
46:5:8/Therefore, let's celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
46:5:9/I told you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.
46:5:10/But I didn't mean the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would have to leave this world.
46:5:11/But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.
46:5:12/What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?
46:5:13/God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked person from among you."
46:6:1/Is it possible that any of you, when you have a dispute with another, would take it to court before the unjust instead of before the saints?
46:6:2/Don't you realize that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, aren't you capable of handling minor disputes?
46:6:3/Don't you know that we will judge angels? How much more, then, matters of this life?
46:6:4/So, if you have disputes about everyday life, appoint as judges those who are of little account in the church.
46:6:5/I'm saying this to your shame. Can it be that there is not a single wise person among you who can decide between their fellow believers?
46:6:6/Yet one brother takes another to court, and this in front of unbelievers!
46:6:7/It is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
46:6:8/Instead, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you do this to your brothers and sisters.
46:6:9/Don't you know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who engage in homosexual acts,
46:6:10/Nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.
46:6:11/And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
46:6:12/Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
46:6:13/Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy them both. The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
46:6:14/And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.
46:6:15/Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Absolutely not!
46:6:16/Don't you realize that anyone who joins themselves to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh."
46:6:17/But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
46:6:18/Run away from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against their own body.
46:6:19/Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;
46:6:20/You were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies and in your spirit, which belong to God.
46:7:1/Regarding your questions, it's beneficial for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.
46:7:2/However, to avoid sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.
46:7:3/The husband should fulfill his marital duties to his wife, and likewise, the wife to her husband.
46:7:4/A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. Similarly, a husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does.
46:7:5/Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain for a limited time to devote yourselves to prayer. Afterwards, come together again so that Satan won't tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
46:7:6/But I say this as a concession, not as a command.
46:7:7/I wish that all people were as I am. But each person has their own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.
46:7:8/To the unmarried and the widows, I say it is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am.
46:7:9/But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
46:7:10/To the married, I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.
46:7:11/But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
46:7:12/To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
46:7:13/And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.
46:7:14/For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
46:7:15/But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.
46:7:16/How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
46:7:17/However, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.
46:7:18/If anyone was circumcised when they were called, they should not become uncircumcised. If anyone was uncircumcised when they were called, they should not be circumcised.
46:7:19/Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts.
46:7:20/Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
46:7:21/Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so.
46:7:22/For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord's freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ's slave.
46:7:23/You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings.
46:7:24/Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
46:7:25/Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
46:7:26/Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a person to remain as they are.
46:7:27/Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife.
46:7:28/But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. However, those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.
46:7:29/What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not;
46:7:30/those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;
46:7:31/those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.
46:7:32/I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs—how he can please the Lord.
46:7:33/But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—
46:7:34/and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband.
46:7:35/I am saying this for your own benefit, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
46:7:36/If anyone thinks that they are behaving improperly toward the woman they are engaged to, if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married.
46:7:37/But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing.
46:7:38/So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.
46:7:39/A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.
46:7:40/In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
46:8:1/Regarding food sacrificed to idols, we understand that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge can make us arrogant, but love builds us up.
46:8:2/And if anyone thinks they know something, they don't yet know as much as they should.
46:8:3/However, if anyone loves God, they are known by Him.
46:8:4/So, about eating food offered to idols, we understand that an idol has no real existence in the world, and there is no God but one.
46:8:5/Even though there are many so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
46:8:6/For us, there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come and for whom we live; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come and through whom we live.
46:8:7/However, not everyone has this understanding. Some people, accustomed to idols until now, eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is polluted.
46:8:8/But food does not bring us closer to God: we are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
46:8:9/But be careful that your freedom does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
46:8:10/For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, won't that person be encouraged, if their conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
46:8:11/And because of your knowledge, the weak brother for whom Christ died is destroyed.
46:8:12/When you thus sin against your brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
46:8:13/Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to stumble.
46:9:1/Aren't I an apostle? Aren't I free? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord?
46:9:2/Even if I'm not considered an apostle by others, I definitely am to you, for you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord.
46:9:3/This is my defense to those who question me:
46:9:4/Don't we have the right to eat and drink?
46:9:5/Don't we have the right to bring along a believing wife, just as the other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Cephas do?
46:9:6/Or is it only I and Barnabas who don't have the right to stop working for a living?
46:9:7/Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and doesn't eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and doesn't drink the milk?
46:9:8/Am I saying this merely from a human perspective, or doesn't the law say the same thing?
46:9:9/For it is written in the Law of Moses, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." Is it about oxen that God is concerned?
46:9:10/Or is he saying it entirely for our sake? Indeed, for our sake it was written: because the plowman should plow in hope, and the thresher should thresh in hope of sharing in the harvest.
46:9:11/If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?
46:9:12/If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? But we haven't used this right. Instead, we endure everything so as not to hinder the gospel of Christ.
46:9:13/Don't you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?
46:9:14/In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
46:9:15/But I haven't used any of these rights. And I'm not writing this to suggest that something should be done for me. Indeed, it would be better for me to die than to allow anyone to deprive me of this boast.
46:9:16/For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, since I am compelled to do so. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
46:9:17/If I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I am still entrusted with a stewardship.
46:9:18/What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel.
46:9:19/Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a servant to everyone, to win as many as possible.
46:9:20/To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law.
46:9:21/To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law.
46:9:22/To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.
46:9:23/And I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
46:9:24/Don't you know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.
46:9:25/Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
46:9:26/Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.
46:9:27/But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others, I myself should be disqualified.
46:10:1/Furthermore, my brothers and sisters, I don't want you to be unaware that all our ancestors were under the cloud and all passed through the sea;
46:10:2/And they were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
46:10:3/And they all ate the same spiritual food;
46:10:4/And they all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual Rock that accompanied them, and that Rock was Christ.
46:10:5/However, God was not pleased with many of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.
46:10:6/These things occurred as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did.
46:10:7/Do not become idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to indulge in revelry."
46:10:8/We should not engage in sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.
46:10:9/We should not test Christ, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes.
46:10:10/Do not grumble, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroyer.
46:10:11/All these things happened to them as examples, and they were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come.
46:10:12/So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall.
46:10:13/No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
46:10:14/Therefore, my dearly loved ones, run away from idolatry.
46:10:15/I am speaking to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
46:10:16/The cup of blessing that we bless, isn't it a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, isn't it a sharing in the body of Christ?
46:10:17/Because there is one bread, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one bread.
46:10:18/Look at Israel according to the flesh: Are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
46:10:19/What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or that what is offered to idols is anything?
46:10:20/But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.
46:10:21/You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord’s table and of the table of demons.
46:10:22/Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
46:10:23/All things are permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial. All things are permissible for me, but not all things build up.
46:10:24/Let no one seek their own good, but the good of others.
46:10:25/Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
46:10:26/For the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.
46:10:27/If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
46:10:28/But if someone tells you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience.
46:10:29/I am referring to the other person's conscience, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?
46:10:30/If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?
46:10:31/So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
46:10:32/Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—
46:10:33/Just as I try to please everyone in every way. Not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved.
46:11:1/Follow my example, just as I follow Christ's.
46:11:2/I commend you for remembering me in everything and for holding on to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.
46:11:3/But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.
46:11:4/Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
46:11:5/But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved.
46:11:6/If a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.
46:11:7/A man should not cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
46:11:8/For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.
46:11:9/Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
46:11:10/For this reason, a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
46:11:11/However, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
46:11:12/For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
46:11:13/Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
46:11:14/Doesn't nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him?
46:11:15/But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.
46:11:16/If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.
46:11:17/But in the following instructions, I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
46:11:18/First of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.
46:11:19/Indeed, there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.
46:11:20/So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,
46:11:21/for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.
46:11:22/What? Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter.
46:11:23/For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
46:11:24/and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is my body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me."
46:11:25/In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."
46:11:26/For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
46:11:27/Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
46:11:28/But a person should examine themselves, and in this way let them eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
46:11:29/For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on themselves.
46:11:30/That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
46:11:31/But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment.
46:11:32/However, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
46:11:33/So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, wait for each other.
46:11:34/If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
46:12:1/Now regarding spiritual gifts, friends, I don't want you to be uninformed.
46:12:2/You know that when you were non-believers, you were swayed toward mute idols, following wherever you were led.
46:12:3/Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking by God's Spirit says Jesus is cursed, and no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.
46:12:4/There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
46:12:5/And there are different ways to serve, but the same Lord.
46:12:6/There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work.
46:12:7/However, the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each person for the common good.
46:12:8/To one person the Spirit gives the ability to share wisdom; to another the same Spirit gives a message of knowledge.
46:12:9/To another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit;
46:12:10/To another miraculous powers; to another prophecy; to another distinguishing between spirits; to another speaking in different kinds of tongues; and to yet another the interpretation of tongues.
46:12:11/But all these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who distributes to each one individually as He wishes.
46:12:12/Just as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
46:12:13/For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
46:12:14/Indeed, the body is not made up of one part but of many.
46:12:15/If the foot should say, "Because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body," it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
46:12:16/And if the ear should say, "Because I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the body," it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
46:12:17/If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
46:12:18/But in fact, God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
46:12:19/If they were all one part, where would the body be?
46:12:20/As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
46:12:21/The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!"
46:12:22/On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
46:12:23/And the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
46:12:24/While our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
46:12:25/So that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.
46:12:26/If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
46:12:27/Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
46:12:28/And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues.
46:12:29/Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
46:12:30/Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
46:12:31/But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.
46:13:1/Even if I speak in the languages of humans and angels but don't have love, I'm just making noise like a loud gong or a clanging cymbal.
46:13:2/And if I have the gift of prophecy, can understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, enough to move mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.
46:13:3/And even if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and offer my body to be burned, but don't have love, it benefits me nothing.
46:13:4/Love is patient and kind; love does not envy; love does not boast, it is not arrogant,
46:13:5/It does not act improperly, is not selfish, is not easily angered, keeps no record of wrongs;
46:13:6/Does not delight in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth;
46:13:7/It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
46:13:8/Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will come to an end; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
46:13:9/For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
46:13:10/But when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.
46:13:11/When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I left behind childish ways.
46:13:12/Now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
46:13:13/And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
46:14:1/Pursue love, and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.
46:14:2/For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit.
46:14:3/However, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort.
46:14:4/The one who speaks in a tongue builds up themselves, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
46:14:5/I wish all of you could speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.
46:14:6/Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
46:14:7/Even lifeless instruments, like the flute or the harp, if they do not make distinct notes, how will anyone know what is being played?
46:14:8/And if the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will get ready for battle?
46:14:9/So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
46:14:10/There are doubtless many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
46:14:11/If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me.
46:14:12/So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.
46:14:13/For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say.
46:14:14/For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive.
46:14:15/What should I do then? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.
46:14:16/Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying?
46:14:17/You are certainly giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
46:14:18/I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
46:14:19/But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
46:14:20/Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.
46:14:21/It is written in the Law: "With people of other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."
46:14:22/Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.
46:14:23/So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
46:14:24/But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all,
46:14:25/as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"
46:14:26/What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.
46:14:27/If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.
46:14:28/If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to themselves and to God.
46:14:29/Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
46:14:30/And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.
46:14:31/For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
46:14:32/The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
46:14:33/For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.
46:14:34/Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.
46:14:35/If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
46:14:36/Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
46:14:37/If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command.
46:14:38/But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.
46:14:39/Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
46:14:40/But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
46:15:1/Furthermore, friends, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you accepted and on which you have taken your stand.
46:15:2/Through this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you—unless you believed without genuine faith.
46:15:3/First and foremost, I passed on to you what I also received: that Christ died for our sins, fulfilling the scriptures;
46:15:4/That he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day, in accordance with the scriptures;
46:15:5/And that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the twelve disciples.
46:15:6/After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the believers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have passed away.
46:15:7/Then he appeared to James, and afterward to all the apostles.
46:15:8/And last of all, he appeared to me too, as to one abnormally born.
46:15:9/For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
46:15:10/But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
46:15:11/So whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
46:15:12/Now if it is proclaimed that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
46:15:13/If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
46:15:14/And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is useless and so is your faith.
46:15:15/Moreover, we would be found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
46:15:16/For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
46:15:17/And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
46:15:18/Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
46:15:19/If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
46:15:20/But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
46:15:21/For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
46:15:22/For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
46:15:23/But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.
46:15:24/Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
46:15:25/For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
46:15:26/The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
46:15:27/For he has put everything under his feet. Now when it says that everything has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.
46:15:28/When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
46:15:29/Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
46:15:30/And why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
46:15:31/I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord.
46:15:32/If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with merely human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
46:15:33/Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character."
46:15:34/Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.
46:15:35/But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?"
46:15:36/You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
46:15:37/And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
46:15:38/But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.
46:15:39/Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.
46:15:40/There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.
46:15:41/There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.
46:15:42/So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;
46:15:43/It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
46:15:44/It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
46:15:45/Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.
46:15:46/However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.
46:15:47/The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven.
46:15:48/As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
46:15:49/And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.
46:15:50/I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
46:15:51/Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
46:15:52/In a flash, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
46:15:53/For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.
46:15:54/So when the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: "Death has been swallowed up in victory."
46:15:55/"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
46:15:56/The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46:15:57/But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
46:15:58/Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
46:16:1/Regarding the collection for the saints, just as I instructed the churches in Galatia, you should do the same.
46:16:2/Every Sunday, each of you should set aside a portion of your income, saving it up, so that there won't need to be any fundraising when I arrive.
46:16:3/And when I arrive, whoever you endorse through your letters, I will send them to deliver your generous donation to Jerusalem.
46:16:4/And if it seems appropriate for me to go as well, they will accompany me.
46:16:5/I plan to visit you after I travel through Macedonia, since I will be passing through there.
46:16:6/It's possible that I'll stay with you for a while, maybe even spend the winter, so you can help me on my journey, wherever I decide to go.
46:16:7/For now, I won't be stopping to see you; but I hope to spend some time with you later, if the Lord allows.
46:16:8/But I'll stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.
46:16:9/Because a great and effective opportunity has opened up for me here, even though there are many who oppose me.
46:16:10/If Timothy arrives, make sure he feels safe with you, for he is doing the Lord's work, just as I am.
46:16:11/So, don't let anyone look down on him. Help him on his way in peace so he can return to me, as I am expecting him along with the brothers.
46:16:12/Regarding our brother Apollos, I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. However, he was not willing to come at this time. He will come when he has the opportunity.
46:16:13/Stay alert, stand firm in your faith, be courageous, be strong.
46:16:14/Make sure everything you do is done with love.
46:16:15/I urge you, brothers and sisters, you know the household of Stephanas was the first convert in Achaia and they have devoted themselves to serving the saints.
46:16:16/Respect such people and everyone who works and labors with us.
46:16:17/I am delighted with the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus because they have made up for your absence.
46:16:18/They have refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Therefore, recognize people like them.
46:16:19/The churches in Asia send their greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, along with the church that meets at their house.
46:16:20/All the brothers and sisters send their greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
46:16:21/This greeting is in my own hand—Paul.
46:16:22/If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let them be cursed. Our Lord, come!
46:16:23/May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
46:16:24/My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
47:1:1/Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, along with all the saints throughout Achaia:
47:1:2/May grace and peace be yours from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
47:1:3/Praise be to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion, and the God who comforts us in every way.
47:1:4/He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
47:1:5/Just as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
47:1:6/If we are distressed, it's for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it's for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
47:1:7/And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
47:1:8/We don't want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of the troubles we experienced in Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself.
47:1:9/Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
47:1:10/He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,
47:1:11/as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
47:1:12/Our pride is this: the testimony of our conscience that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God's grace.
47:1:13/We write to you nothing other than what you can read and understand. And I hope you will fully understand,
47:1:14/just as you have partially understood us, that you can be proud of us just as we will be proud of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.
47:1:15/Confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.
47:1:16/I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.
47:1:17/When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?
47:1:18/But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."
47:1:19/For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."
47:1:20/For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.
47:1:21/Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,
47:1:22/set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
47:1:23/I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
47:1:24/Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.
47:2:1/I decided that I wouldn't visit you again if it meant bringing sadness.
47:2:2/Because if I make you sad, who's there to make me happy except the one I've made sad?
47:2:3/And I wrote to you for this reason, so that when I came, I wouldn't be saddened by those I should be rejoicing with; trusting that all of you share in my joy.
47:2:4/With a heavy heart and many tears, I wrote to you, not to upset you, but to let you know the deep love I have for you.
47:2:5/But if anyone has caused sadness, they haven't just upset me, but to some extent—not to overstate it—all of you.
47:2:6/The punishment given by many is enough for such a person.
47:2:7/Instead, you should forgive and comfort him, so he isn't overwhelmed by excessive sadness.
47:2:8/That's why I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
47:2:9/I wrote for this reason: to test your willingness to obey in everything.
47:2:10/If you forgive anyone, I do too. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I did it for your sake, in the presence of Christ,
47:2:11/So that we wouldn't be outwitted by Satan; we're not unaware of his schemes.
47:2:12/When I went to Troas to spread the gospel of Christ and found an opportunity from the Lord,
47:2:13/I had no peace because I didn't find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye and went on to Macedonia.
47:2:14/But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
47:2:15/For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
47:2:16/To the one, we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is qualified for such a task?
47:2:17/Unlike so many, we don't peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.
47:3:1/Are we starting to praise ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of introduction to you or from you?
47:3:2/You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
47:3:3/It's clear that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone but on the human heart.
47:3:4/And we have such confidence through Christ towards God.
47:3:5/It's not that we think we can do anything on our own; our ability comes from God.
47:3:6/He has also made us competent as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter but of the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
47:3:7/But if the ministry that brought death, carved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites couldn't gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was fading away,
47:3:8/How will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more glorious?
47:3:9/For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness far exceeds it in glory.
47:3:10/Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory.
47:3:11/For if what was fading away came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.
47:3:12/Therefore, since we have such hope, we are very bold,
47:3:13/Not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
47:3:14/But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
47:3:15/Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.
47:3:16/But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
47:3:17/Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
47:3:18/And we all, with unveiled faces, looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; and this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.
47:4:1/So, since we have this ministry because we were shown mercy, we do not lose heart.
47:4:2/But we have rejected shameful, hidden practices, not acting with deceit or distorting God's word. Instead, by presenting the truth plainly, we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the presence of God.
47:4:3/But if our good news is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
47:4:4/In their case, the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
47:4:5/For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.
47:4:6/For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory displayed in the face of Christ.
47:4:7/But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
47:4:8/We are hard-pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
47:4:9/Persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;
47:4:10/Always carrying in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
47:4:11/For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body.
47:4:12/So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
47:4:13/With that same spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I believed; therefore, I have spoken," we also believe and therefore speak,
47:4:14/Knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you.
47:4:15/For all this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
47:4:16/Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
47:4:17/For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
47:4:18/So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
47:5:1/We know that if our earthly body, our temporary home, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a home not made by human hands, eternal in the heavens.
47:5:2/In this body, we sigh with longing, eagerly waiting to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,
47:5:3/So that when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
47:5:4/While we live in this body, we groan under our burdens, not wishing to be stripped of it but to be clothed with our heavenly body, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
47:5:5/Now the one who has prepared us for this very purpose is God, who has also given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
47:5:6/So we are always confident, knowing that as long as we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
47:5:7/(For we live by faith, not by what we see.)
47:5:8/We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
47:5:9/So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.
47:5:10/For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
47:5:11/Knowing the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade others. We are well known to God, and I hope we are also well known to your consciences.
47:5:12/We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so you can have an answer for those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
47:5:13/Whether we are out of our mind, it is for God; or whether we are in our right mind, it is for you.
47:5:14/For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.
47:5:15/And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
47:5:16/So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
47:5:17/Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!
47:5:18/All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,
47:5:19/That is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
47:5:20/We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.
47:5:21/For God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
47:6:1/We then, as coworkers with him, urge you also not to receive God's grace in vain.
47:6:2/(For he says, "I have listened to you at the perfect time, and on the day of salvation, I have helped you: look, now is the perfect time; look, now is the day of salvation.")
47:6:3/Avoiding any offense in anything, so that the ministry is not criticized:
47:6:4/But in everything presenting ourselves as servants of God, with great patience, in hardships, in needs, in distresses,
47:6:5/Through beatings, imprisonments, riots, hard work, sleepless nights, and fasting;
47:6:6/By purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,
47:6:7/Through the message of truth, by the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left,
47:6:8/Through honor and dishonor, through bad report and good report: as deceivers, yet truthful;
47:6:9/As unknown, yet well recognized; as dying, and see, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death;
47:6:10/As sad, yet always joyful; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
47:6:11/O Corinthians, we have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open.
47:6:12/You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
47:6:13/Now in return (I speak as to my children), be also open-hearted.
47:6:14/Do not be mismatched with unbelievers: for what partnership does righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
47:6:15/And what agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever?
47:6:16/And what accord does the temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, "I will live with them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
47:6:17/Therefore, separate yourselves from them, says the Lord, and do not touch the unclean thing; and I will welcome you.
47:6:18/And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
47:7:1/Having these promises, dear friends, let's purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, striving for complete holiness out of reverence for God.
47:7:2/Accept us; we haven't wronged anyone, we haven't corrupted anyone, we haven't cheated anyone.
47:7:3/I'm not saying this to condemn you: I've already told you that you have a place in our hearts, to share both life and death.
47:7:4/My openness in speaking to you is great, my pride in you is immense: I am filled with comfort, I am overwhelmingly joyful despite all our troubles.
47:7:5/For when we arrived in Macedonia, we had no rest, but faced trouble at every turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within.
47:7:6/But God, who comforts the downhearted, comforted us by the arrival of Titus;
47:7:7/And not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.
47:7:8/Even if my letter made you sad, I don't regret it. Though I did regret it—I see that that letter made you sad, even if only for a little while.
47:7:9/Now I'm glad, not because you were made sad, but because your sadness led to repentance. You became sad in a godly way, so that you were not harmed by us in any way.
47:7:10/For sadness that is according to God produces a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret, but worldly sadness brings death.
47:7:11/See what this godly sadness has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In every way, you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
47:7:12/So even though I wrote to you, it wasn’t for the sake of the offender or the victim, but to show you before God how much you care for us.
47:7:13/That's why we were comforted. And in our comfort, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
47:7:14/For if I have boasted to him about anything concerning you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke everything to you in truth, so our boasting to Titus has been proven true.
47:7:15/And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that all of you were obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.
47:7:16/I am therefore very happy that I can have complete confidence in you in everything.
47:8:1/Furthermore, friends, we want to tell you about the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia;
47:8:2/Despite facing severe trials and extreme poverty, their overflowing joy and generosity resulted in rich generosity.
47:8:3/Indeed, I can testify that they gave as much as they could, and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own initiative;
47:8:4/They urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.
47:8:5/And they did this not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and then to us in accordance with God's will.
47:8:6/So much so that we asked Titus to complete this act of grace among you as well.
47:8:7/Therefore, just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in your love for us—see that you also excel in this grace of giving.
47:8:8/I'm not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the eagerness of others.
47:8:9/For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
47:8:10/And in this matter I am giving my advice: It is beneficial for you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it.
47:8:11/Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.
47:8:12/For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.
47:8:13/My intention is not that others should be relieved while you are burdened, but that there might be equality.
47:8:14/At the present time, your surplus will meet their need, so that in turn their surplus will meet your need, and in this way there will be equality.
47:8:15/As it is written: "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little."
47:8:16/But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.
47:8:17/For he not only accepted our appeal, but being very eager, he is coming to you on his own initiative.
47:8:18/And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.
47:8:19/Not only that, but he was also chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry this act of grace, which is administered by us for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.
47:8:20/We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.
47:8:21/For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of people.
47:8:22/And we are sending with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many matters, but now even more so because of his great confidence in you.
47:8:23/As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.
47:8:24/Therefore, show them the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, in the sight of the churches.
47:9:1/Regarding helping the saints, it's really not necessary for me to write to you about it.
47:9:2/I'm aware of your eagerness, which I've proudly told the people of Macedonia about, saying that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your enthusiasm has inspired many others.
47:9:3/However, I've sent the brothers to make sure that our boasting about you isn't empty in this matter; that, as I said, you may be prepared:
47:9:4/So that if the Macedonians come with me and see you unprepared, we (not to mention you) would be embarrassed about this confident boasting.
47:9:5/That's why I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and arrange your generous donation, which you had previously promised, so that it would be ready as a generous gift, not as something you felt forced to do.
47:9:6/But what I'm saying is, the one who plants sparingly will also harvest sparingly; and the one who plants generously will also harvest generously.
47:9:7/Each person should give what they have decided in their heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, because God loves a cheerful giver.
47:9:8/And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work:
47:9:9/(As it is written, "He has scattered his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever."
47:9:10/Now the one who provides seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.)
47:9:11/You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
47:9:12/This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
47:9:13/Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.
47:9:14/And in their prayers for you, their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.
47:9:15/Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift.
47:10:1/I, Paul, am asking you with the humility and kindness of Christ. I might seem unimpressive in person, but I'm bold when I'm not with you.
47:10:2/But I'm asking you so that I won't have to be as bold in person as I expect to be against some people who think we live by worldly standards.
47:10:3/Even though we live in human bodies, we don't fight with human plans and methods.
47:10:4/Our weapons in this fight are not human but are powerful through God for tearing down strongholds.
47:10:5/We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
47:10:6/And we are ready to punish all disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
47:10:7/Do you judge by appearances? If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should reconsider that we belong to Christ just as much as they do.
47:10:8/Even if I boast a little too much about the authority the Lord gave us to build you up and not tear you down, I won't be ashamed.
47:10:9/So that I won't seem like I'm trying to scare you with my letters.
47:10:10/Some say, "His letters are serious and forceful, but in person he is weak, and his speaking amounts to nothing."
47:10:11/Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.
47:10:12/We don't dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they lack understanding.
47:10:13/We, however, will not boast beyond our proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has assigned to us, a field that reaches even to you.
47:10:14/We are not overstepping our bounds, as if we hadn't come to you, for we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.
47:10:15/We don't boast about work done by others outside our assigned area. But we have hope that as your faith grows, our area of activity among you will greatly expand,
47:10:16/So we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, without boasting about work already done in someone else's territory.
47:10:17/But, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
47:10:18/For it's not the one who commends themselves who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
47:11:1/I wish you could put up with a little of my foolishness; please bear with me.
47:11:2/I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
47:11:3/But I'm afraid that, just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts might be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
47:11:4/If someone comes and preaches a different Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you might well put up with it.
47:11:5/I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles.
47:11:6/Even if I am unskilled in speech, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, we have made this clear to you in every way.
47:11:7/Did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you could be elevated, because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge?
47:11:8/I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
47:11:9/And when I was with you and in need, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.
47:11:10/As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.
47:11:11/Why? Because I don't love you? God knows I do.
47:11:12/But what I do, I will continue to do, to cut off the opportunity from those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.
47:11:13/For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ.
47:11:14/And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
47:11:15/So it is no surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.
47:11:16/I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But if you do, then accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
47:11:17/What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not as the Lord would but as a fool.
47:11:18/Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
47:11:19/For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves.
47:11:20/For you bear it if someone makes you slaves, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face.
47:11:21/To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone is bold—I am speaking foolishly—I also am bold.
47:11:22/Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I.
47:11:23/Are they servants of Christ? I am out of my mind to talk like this—I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.
47:11:24/Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
47:11:25/Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea;
47:11:26/I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers.
47:11:27/I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.
47:11:28/Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.
47:11:29/Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?
47:11:30/If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
47:11:31/The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.
47:11:32/In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.
47:11:33/But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
47:12:1/It's not really beneficial for me to boast. I'm going to talk about visions and revelations from the Lord instead.
47:12:2/I knew someone in Christ more than fourteen years ago, (whether physically present or not, I can't say; God knows) who was taken up to the third heaven.
47:12:3/And I knew such a person, (whether in the body or out of the body, I can't say; God knows)
47:12:4/How he was taken up into paradise and heard indescribable things, which no one is permitted to tell.
47:12:5/I will boast about such a person, but not about myself, except about my weaknesses.
47:12:6/Even though I might want to boast, I won't be foolish; I'll stick to the truth. But I'm holding back so no one thinks more of me than what they see or hear from me.
47:12:7/To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given to me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.
47:12:8/Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
47:12:9/But he said to me, "My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness." So I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.
47:12:10/That's why I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
47:12:11/I've been made to look foolish for boasting. You forced me to it, because I should have been commended by you. For I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing.
47:12:12/The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs, wonders, and miracles.
47:12:13/How were you inferior to other churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.
47:12:14/Look, I'm ready to visit you for the third time, and I won't be a burden. I don't want what you have, but you. For children shouldn't save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
47:12:15/And I will most gladly spend and be spent for you. Even if the more I love you, the less I am loved.
47:12:16/But let it be. I didn't burden you. Yet, being crafty, I caught you by trickery.
47:12:17/Did I exploit you through any of those I sent to you?
47:12:18/I urged Titus to go, and sent a brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn't we act in the same spirit and follow the same steps?
47:12:19/Do you think we're defending ourselves to you? We speak in the sight of God in Christ. But everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.
47:12:20/I'm afraid that when I come I may not find you as I hope, and you may not find me as you wish. I fear there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.
47:12:21/I'm afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will mourn over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin, and debauchery they have practiced.
47:13:1/This is the third time I'm coming to you. Every statement will be confirmed by two or three witnesses.
47:13:2/I warned you before, and I'm warning you again as if I were there in person, even though I'm not there now. I'm writing to those who have sinned before and to everyone else, warning you that I won't hold back if I have to come again.
47:13:3/Since you're looking for proof that Christ is speaking through me, who is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful among you.
47:13:4/Even though he was crucified in weakness, he lives by the power of God. We too are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God directed toward you.
47:13:5/Test yourselves to see if you're in the faith; examine yourselves. Don't you realize that Jesus Christ is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?
47:13:6/But I trust that you will realize that we are not failures.
47:13:7/Now I pray to God that you do no wrong, not so we can prove ourselves, but so you can do what is right, even though we may seem like failures to you.
47:13:8/We can't act against the truth, only for the truth.
47:13:9/We are happy when we are weak but you are strong. What we really want is for you to become mature.
47:13:10/That's why I'm writing these things while I'm away, so I don't have to be harsh when I'm with you, using the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not tearing you down.
47:13:11/Finally, friends, goodbye. Aim for perfection, be encouraged, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
47:13:12/Greet each other with a sacred kiss.
47:13:13/All the saints send their greetings.
47:13:14/May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
48:1:1/Paul, an apostle, (not appointed by people, nor through a person, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
48:1:2/And all the brothers and sisters with me, to the churches in Galatia: 
48:1:3/May grace and peace be yours from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 
48:1:4/Who sacrificed himself for our sins, to rescue us from this current evil age, in line with God's will and our Father: 
48:1:5/To whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
48:1:6/I'm amazed that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel; 
48:1:7/Which is really not another gospel at all. However, there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
48:1:8/But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, let them be under God's curse.
48:1:9/As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let them be under God's curse.
48:1:10/Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.
48:1:11/But I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.
48:1:12/I did not receive it from any human source, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation from Jesus Christ.
48:1:13/You have heard about my previous way of life in Judaism, how I intensely persecuted God's church and tried to destroy it. 
48:1:14/And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, being more extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.
48:1:15/But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, was pleased 
48:1:16/To reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone. 
48:1:17/I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia, and later returned to Damascus.
48:1:18/Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.
48:1:19/But I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord's brother.
48:1:20/Now concerning the things I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.
48:1:21/Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 
48:1:22/And I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
48:1:23/But they only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."
48:1:24/And they praised God because of me.
48:2:1/Then fourteen years later, I went back to Jerusalem with Barnabas, bringing Titus along too.
48:2:2/I went there because of a revelation and shared with them the gospel I preach among the Gentiles, but I did this privately with those who were influential, to make sure I wasn't working or hadn't worked for nothing.
48:2:3/But Titus, who was with me and is Greek, wasn't forced to be circumcised:
48:2:4/This was because of some fake believers who had sneaked in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, aiming to enslave us.
48:2:5/We didn't give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.
48:2:6/But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism) - those recognized leaders added nothing to my message.
48:2:7/On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised just as Peter had been to the circumcised,
48:2:8/(For the one who worked powerfully in Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked powerfully in me towards the Gentiles),
48:2:9/And when James, Cephas (Peter), and John, who were recognized as pillars, realized the grace given to me, they extended the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
48:2:10/They only asked us to remember the poor, which was something I was eager to do anyway.
48:2:11/But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong.
48:2:12/Before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to withdraw and separate himself, fearing those from the circumcision group.
48:2:13/The other Jews joined him in this hypocrisy, so much so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
48:2:14/But when I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "If you, a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?"
48:2:15/We are Jews by birth and not 'Gentile sinners',
48:2:16/Yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.
48:2:17/But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
48:2:18/If I rebuild what I once destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.
48:2:19/Through the law, I died to the law so that I might live for God.
48:2:20/I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
48:2:21/I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
48:3:1/Oh foolish Galatians, who has tricked you into not following the truth, when Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?
48:3:2/I only want to ask you this: Did you receive the Spirit by following the law, or by believing what you heard?
48:3:3/Are you so foolish? After starting with the Spirit, are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?
48:3:4/Have you experienced so much for nothing—if it really was for nothing?
48:3:5/So, the one who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
48:3:6/Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
48:3:7/Know then that those who have faith are the children of Abraham.
48:3:8/And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all nations be blessed."
48:3:9/So then, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
48:3:10/For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."
48:3:11/But it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because "The righteous will live by faith."
48:3:12/The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, "The person who does these things will live by them."
48:3:13/Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole."
48:3:14/He did this so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
48:3:15/Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.
48:3:16/The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," meaning one person, who is Christ.
48:3:17/What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
48:3:18/For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
48:3:19/Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator.
48:3:20/A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.
48:3:21/Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
48:3:22/But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
48:3:23/Before faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.
48:3:24/So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.
48:3:25/But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
48:3:26/For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
48:3:27/For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
48:3:28/There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48:3:29/And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
48:4:1/Now I'm saying, the heir, as long as they are a child, is no different from a servant, even though they are the master of everything;
48:4:2/But is under guardians and managers until the time set by the father.
48:4:3/In the same way, when we were children, we were enslaved to the basic principles of the world.
48:4:4/But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
48:4:5/To free those who were under the law, so that we might become God's children.
48:4:6/And because you are children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, calling out, "Father, my Father."
48:4:7/Therefore, you are no longer a servant, but a child; and if a child, then an heir through God in Christ.
48:4:8/However, back then, when you didn't know God, you served those who are not really gods at all.
48:4:9/But now, after getting to know God—or rather being known by God—how can you turn back to those weak and worthless principles, wanting to be enslaved by them all over again?
48:4:10/You observe special days, months, seasons, and years.
48:4:11/I'm worried about you, that perhaps I have wasted my efforts on you.
48:4:12/Brothers and sisters, I urge you to be like me, because I am like you. You have done me no wrong.
48:4:13/You know that it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.
48:4:14/And even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
48:4:15/What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48:4:16/So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48:4:17/They are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.
48:4:18/It's good to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.
48:4:19/My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
48:4:20/I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.
48:4:21/Tell me, you who want to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?
48:4:22/For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
48:4:23/But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the son by the free woman was born through promise.
48:4:24/These things are symbolic. For these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
48:4:25/Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
48:4:26/But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
48:4:27/For it is written, "Rejoice, barren woman who does not give birth; shout for joy and cry out, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate woman will be more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband."
48:4:28/Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48:4:29/At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
48:4:30/But what does the Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the son of the free woman."
48:4:31/So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
48:5:1/Therefore, stand firm in the freedom Christ has given us, and don't get caught up again in a life of bondage.
48:5:2/Listen, I, Paul, am telling you that if you get circumcised, Christ won't be of any benefit to you.
48:5:3/I'm saying it again to anyone who gets circumcised: you're obligated to follow the entire law.
48:5:4/If you try to be justified by the law, Christ won't mean anything to you; you've lost your connection to grace.
48:5:5/Through the Spirit, we eagerly await the righteousness we hope for, which comes through faith.
48:5:6/In Jesus Christ, it doesn't matter whether you are circumcised or not; what matters is faith expressing itself through love.
48:5:7/You were doing so well; who stopped you from following the truth?
48:5:8/This kind of persuasion doesn't come from the One who calls you.
48:5:9/Just a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.
48:5:10/I'm confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is troubling you will face punishment, whoever they are.
48:5:11/And if I'm still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the offense of the cross has been eliminated.
48:5:12/I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!
48:5:13/Brothers and sisters, you were called to be free; but don't use your freedom to indulge the flesh. Instead, serve one another humbly in love.
48:5:14/The entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."
48:5:15/But if you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.
48:5:16/So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
48:5:17/For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so you are not to do whatever you want.
48:5:18/But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
48:5:19/Now the acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,
48:5:20/idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,
48:5:21/envy, murder, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48:5:22/But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48:5:23/gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
48:5:24/Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of the flesh to the cross.
48:5:25/If we live by the Spirit, let's also keep in step with the Spirit.
48:5:26/Let's not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
48:6:1/Friends, if someone is caught in a mistake, those of you who are spiritual should help that person back on the right path gently. But watch yourself, or you might also be tempted.
48:6:2/Help carry each other's burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.
48:6:3/If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
48:6:4/But each person should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else.
48:6:5/For each person will have to carry their own load.
48:6:6/Those who receive instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.
48:6:7/Do not be misled; God cannot be mocked. A person reaps what they sow.
48:6:8/Those who sow to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but those who sow to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
48:6:9/Let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest if we don't give up.
48:6:10/Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, let's do good to everyone, especially to those in the family of faith.
48:6:11/You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
48:6:12/Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48:6:13/For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh.
48:6:14/But as for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48:6:15/For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
48:6:16/Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.
48:6:17/From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
48:6:18/Brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
49:1:1/Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, to the saints in Ephesus, and to those faithful in Christ Jesus:
49:1:2/May grace and peace be yours, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
49:1:3/Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ:
49:1:4/He chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight, out of love:
49:1:5/He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will,
49:1:6/To the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.
49:1:7/In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace
49:1:8/That he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding,
49:1:9/He made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,
49:1:10/To be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
49:1:11/In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,
49:1:12/So that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.
49:1:13/And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
49:1:14/Who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of his glory.
49:1:15/That's why, after hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
49:1:16/I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.
49:1:17/I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so you can know him better.
49:1:18/I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people,
49:1:19/And his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength
49:1:20/He exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,
49:1:21/Far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
49:1:22/And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,
49:1:23/Which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
49:2:1/And you, he has made alive, who were dead in your wrongdoings and sins;
49:2:2/In which you once lived following the ways of this world, under the influence of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit that is now at work in those who disobey.
49:2:3/Among them, we too all previously lived, indulging in the cravings of our flesh, following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were naturally deserving of wrath.
49:2:4/But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
49:2:5/Even when we were dead in our sins, made us alive together with Christ - by grace you have been saved -
49:2:6/And raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
49:2:7/So that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
49:2:8/For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -
49:2:9/Not by works, so that no one can boast.
49:2:10/For we are his craftsmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
49:2:11/Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (which is done in the body by human hands) -
49:2:12/At that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
49:2:13/But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
49:2:14/For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
49:2:15/By setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,
49:2:16/And in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
49:2:17/And he came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
49:2:18/For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
49:2:19/Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household,
49:2:20/Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
49:2:21/In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
49:2:22/And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
49:3:1/For this reason, I, Paul, am a prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
49:3:2/If you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,
49:3:3/How by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I briefly wrote earlier,
49:3:4/So that when you read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ)
49:3:5/Which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
49:3:6/That the Gentiles are co-heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in his promise in Christ through the gospel,
49:3:7/Of which I became a servant, according to the gift of God's grace given to me by the working of his power.
49:3:8/To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ,
49:3:9/And to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ.
49:3:10/So that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
49:3:11/According to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
49:3:12/In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
49:3:13/Therefore, I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
49:3:14/For this reason I kneel before the Father,
49:3:15/From whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
49:3:16/That he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
49:3:17/So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
49:3:18/May have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
49:3:19/And to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
49:3:20/Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,
49:3:21/To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
49:4:1/I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received,
49:4:2/With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love;
49:4:3/Making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
49:4:4/There is one body, and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called;
49:4:5/One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49:4:6/One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
49:4:7/But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
49:4:8/This is why it says: "When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people."
49:4:9/(What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?
49:4:10/He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
49:4:11/So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,
49:4:12/To equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
49:4:13/Until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
49:4:14/Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.
49:4:15/Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.
49:4:16/From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
49:4:17/So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
49:4:18/They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
49:4:19/Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.
49:4:20/However, that is not the way of life you learned
49:4:21/When you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
49:4:22/You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
49:4:23/And to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
49:4:24/And to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
49:4:25/Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.
49:4:26/"In your anger do not sin": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,
49:4:27/And do not give the devil a foothold.
49:4:28/Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need.
49:4:29/Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
49:4:30/And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49:4:31/Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
49:4:32/And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
49:5:1/Therefore, be imitators of God, as beloved children;
49:5:2/And live in love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
49:5:3/But sexual immorality, all impurity, or greed should not even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints;
49:5:4/No obscene language, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of place, but instead, be thankful.
49:5:5/For you can be sure that no one who is sexually immoral, impure, or greedy (which is idolatry) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
49:5:6/Don't let anyone deceive you with empty words, for because of these things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
49:5:7/Therefore, do not be partners with them.
49:5:8/For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light,
49:5:9/(For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),
49:5:10/Demonstrating what is pleasing to the Lord.
49:5:11/And have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
49:5:12/It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
49:5:13/But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.
49:5:14/Therefore it says, "Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
49:5:15/So be careful how you live, not as unwise but as wise,
49:5:16/Making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
49:5:17/Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
49:5:18/And do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless living, but be filled with the Spirit,
49:5:19/Speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord,
49:5:20/Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
49:5:21/Submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49:5:22/Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
49:5:23/For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
49:5:24/Just as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
49:5:25/Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
49:5:26/To make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
49:5:27/And to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
49:5:28/In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49:5:29/For no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—
49:5:30/For we are members of his body.
49:5:31/For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.
49:5:32/This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.
49:5:33/However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
49:6:1/Children, listen to your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.
49:6:2/Respect your father and mother, which is the first commandment that comes with a promise.
49:6:3/So that things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.
49:6:4/And fathers, do not make your children angry, but raise them with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord.
49:6:5/Employees, obey your earthly employers with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.
49:6:6/Don't just work hard when they are watching you and to make them happy, but work sincerely as servants of Christ, doing God's will from your heart.
49:6:7/Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,
49:6:8/Knowing that whatever good anyone does, they will receive the same from the Lord, whether they are a slave or free.
49:6:9/And employers, treat your employees in the same way. Don't threaten them; remember, you both have the same Master in heaven, and He has no favorites.
49:6:10/Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
49:6:11/Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
49:6:12/For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
49:6:13/Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
49:6:14/Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,
49:6:15/And with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
49:6:16/In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
49:6:17/Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49:6:18/Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.
49:6:19/Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
49:6:20/For which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.
49:6:21/But so that you also may know about my situation and what I am doing, Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything.
49:6:22/I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts.
49:6:23/Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49:6:24/Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love. Amen.
50:1:1/Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, including the overseers and deacons:
50:1:2/May grace and peace be yours, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50:1:3/I thank my God every time I remember you,
50:1:4/Always praying with joy for all of you in every one of my prayers,
50:1:5/Because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now;
50:1:6/Being sure of this, that the one who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.
50:1:7/It's right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.
50:1:8/God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Jesus Christ.
50:1:9/And this is my prayer: that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight
50:1:10/So that you can discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
50:1:11/Filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.
50:1:12/But I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel;
50:1:13/So that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ.
50:1:14/And most of the brothers and sisters, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
50:1:15/Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.
50:1:16/The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel;
50:1:17/But the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to cause me trouble in my imprisonment.
50:1:18/What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,
50:1:19/For I know that this will lead to my salvation through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
50:1:20/As per my eager expectation and hope, that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
50:1:21/For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.
50:1:22/But if I am to live in the flesh, this means fruitful labor for me; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell.
50:1:23/I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
50:1:24/However, to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
50:1:25/Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
50:1:26/So that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.
50:1:27/Only live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,
50:1:28/And not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
50:1:29/For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him,
50:1:30/Having the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
50:2:1/So if there's any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any sharing in the Spirit, if any compassion and sympathy,
50:2:2/then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being in full agreement and of one mind.
50:2:3/Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,
50:2:4/not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
50:2:5/Adopt the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
50:2:6/Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be exploited,
50:2:7/but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in human likeness.
50:2:8/And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross.
50:2:9/Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,
50:2:10/so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
50:2:11/and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50:2:12/Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
50:2:13/For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.
50:2:14/Do everything without grumbling or arguing,
50:2:15/so that you may become blameless and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation." Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky
50:2:16/as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.
50:2:17/But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
50:2:18/So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
50:2:19/But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.
50:2:20/For I have no one else like him, who will genuinely care for your welfare.
50:2:21/For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50:2:22/But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
50:2:23/So I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
50:2:24/And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
50:2:25/However, I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.
50:2:26/For he longed for all of you and was distressed because you had heard he was ill.
50:2:27/Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
50:2:28/Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.
50:2:29/So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,
50:2:30/because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.
50:3:1/Finally, my friends, be joyful in the Lord. Writing the same things to you is not a burden for me, but it's for your safety.
50:3:2/Watch out for those who cause trouble, watch out for those who do evil, watch out for those who try to divide you.
50:3:3/For we are the true believers, who worship God with our spirits, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and don't rely on human achievements.
50:3:4/Even though I could have confidence in my own achievements. If anyone else thinks they have reasons to trust in their achievements, I have more:
50:3:5/I was circumcised on the eighth day, born into the people of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew among Hebrews; in regards to the law, a Pharisee;
50:3:6/In my zeal, I persecuted the church; according to the righteousness in the law, I was faultless.
50:3:7/But whatever gains I had, I now consider them a loss for the sake of Christ.
50:3:8/Indeed, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ,
50:3:9/And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.
50:3:10/So that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and may share in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
50:3:11/If somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
50:3:12/Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
50:3:13/Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,
50:3:14/I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
50:3:15/Therefore, all of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.
50:3:16/However, let us live up to what we have already attained.
50:3:17/Brothers and sisters, join in following my example, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
50:3:18/For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
50:3:19/Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.
50:3:20/But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
50:3:21/Who will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control.
50:4:1/Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
50:4:2/I urge Euodias, and I urge Syntyche, to agree with each other in the Lord.
50:4:3/And I also ask you, my true partner, to help these women who have worked hard with me in spreading the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers, whose names are in the book of life.
50:4:4/Always be joyful in the Lord: I'll say it again, be joyful.
50:4:5/Let everyone see your gentleness. The Lord is near.
50:4:6/Don't worry about anything; instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
50:4:7/And the peace of God, which is beyond all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50:4:8/Finally, brothers and sisters, focus on whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
50:4:9/Put into practice what you have learned, received, heard from me, and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.
50:4:10/I was greatly joyful in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Though you were concerned, you had no opportunity to show it.
50:4:11/Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
50:4:12/I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
50:4:13/I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
50:4:14/However, it was good of you to share in my troubles.
50:4:15/You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone.
50:4:16/Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need.
50:4:17/Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that is increasing to your account.
50:4:18/But I have received everything in full and have an abundance. I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
50:4:19/And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
50:4:20/To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
50:4:21/Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters with me send their greetings.
50:4:22/All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household.
50:4:23/May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
51:1:1/Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51:1:2/To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ at Colossae: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
51:1:3/We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
51:1:4/Ever since we heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all God's people,
51:1:5/Because of the hope stored up for you in heaven, which you have already heard about in the true message of the gospel,
51:1:6/That has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God's grace.
51:1:7/Just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,
51:1:8/And he has also told us of your love in the Spirit.
51:1:9/For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,
51:1:10/So that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
51:1:11/Being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully
51:1:12/Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light.
51:1:13/For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,
51:1:14/In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51:1:15/The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
51:1:16/For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.
51:1:17/He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
51:1:18/And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
51:1:19/For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
51:1:20/And through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
51:1:21/Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
51:1:22/But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—
51:1:23/If you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
51:1:24/Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
51:1:25/I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness—
51:1:26/The mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord's people.
51:1:27/To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51:1:28/He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.
51:1:29/To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.
51:2:1/I wish you knew the great struggle I have for you, for those in Laodicea, and for everyone who hasn't met me personally;
51:2:2/So that their hearts may be comforted, united in love, leading to the full richness of complete understanding, recognizing the mystery of God, the Father, and Christ;
51:2:3/In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51:2:4/I'm saying this so no one can deceive you with persuasive arguments.
51:2:5/Even though I'm not there in person, I'm with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your disciplined life and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
51:2:6/Just as you accepted Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him:
51:2:7/Rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with gratitude.
51:2:8/Be careful that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.
51:2:9/For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,
51:2:10/And you have been made complete in him, who is the head over every authority and power:
51:2:11/In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ,
51:2:12/Buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
51:2:13/And when you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
51:2:14/Cancelling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.
51:2:15/And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
51:2:16/Therefore, don't let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration, or a Sabbath day.
51:2:17/These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.
51:2:18/Don't let anyone disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and the worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by a sensuous mind,
51:2:19/And not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
51:2:20/If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations—
51:2:21/"Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch"
51:2:22/(Referring to things that all perish as they are used)—according to human precepts and teachings?
51:2:23/These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-imposed piety, humility, and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
51:3:1/If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
51:3:2/Focus your desires on things above, not on earthly things.
51:3:3/For you have died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
51:3:4/When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you too will appear with him in glory.
51:3:5/Therefore, put to death your earthly inclinations; sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.
51:3:6/Because of these, God's anger comes on those who are disobedient.
51:3:7/You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived.
51:3:8/But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things; anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
51:3:9/Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices
51:3:10/And have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
51:3:11/Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.
51:3:12/Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
51:3:13/Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
51:3:14/And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
51:3:15/Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.
51:3:16/Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
51:3:17/And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
51:3:18/Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is appropriate in the Lord.
51:3:19/Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
51:3:20/Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
51:3:21/Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.
51:3:22/Workers, obey your earthly masters in everything; not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
51:3:23/Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters,
51:3:24/Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.
51:3:25/But anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.
51:4:1/Employers, treat your employees fairly and equally, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.
51:4:2/Keep praying persistently, and stay alert in your prayers with gratitude.
51:4:3/Also pray for us, that God may open a door for us to share the mystery of Christ, for which I am also imprisoned.
51:4:4/So that I can reveal it clearly, as I should.
51:4:5/Act wisely towards outsiders, making the most of every opportunity.
51:4:6/Always let your conversation be full of grace, seasoned with salt, so you may know how to respond to everyone.
51:4:7/Tychicus will tell you all about my situation. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord.
51:4:8/I've sent him to you for this very purpose, so he can update you about us and encourage your hearts.
51:4:9/He is coming with Onesimus, a faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that's happening here.
51:4:10/Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings, and so does Mark, Barnabas's cousin. (You've received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)
51:4:11/And Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jewish believers among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
51:4:12/Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.
51:4:13/I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
51:4:14/Luke, the beloved doctor, and Demas send greetings.
51:4:15/Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51:4:16/After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.
51:4:17/Tell Archippus: "Be sure to carry out the ministry the Lord gave you."
51:4:18/This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
52:1:1/Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
52:1:2/We always thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers;
52:1:3/Constantly remembering your faith-driven work, your labor motivated by love, and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father;
52:1:4/Knowing, beloved brothers and sisters, that you are chosen by God.
52:1:5/For our message came to you not merely in words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction; you know how we lived among you for your benefit.
52:1:6/And you followed our example and the Lord's, receiving the message amid severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
52:1:7/So that you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
52:1:8/For from you the word of the Lord has echoed not only in Macedonia and Achaia but in every place your faith in God has become known, so we don't need to say anything.
52:1:9/For they themselves report about us what kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
52:1:10/And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
52:2:1/You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.
52:2:2/But even after we had suffered and were mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the courage through our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of strong opposition.
52:2:3/Our appeal does not come from deceit, impurity, or trickery.
52:2:4/Instead, as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, we speak not to please people but to please God who tests our hearts.
52:2:5/We never used flattery, as you know, nor did we put on a mask to cover greed—God is our witness.
52:2:6/We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority.
52:2:7/Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
52:2:8/So deeply do we care for you that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.
52:2:9/You remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you while we preached to you the gospel of God.
52:2:10/You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless we were among you who believed.
52:2:11/You know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, 
52:2:12/Encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
52:2:13/And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe.
52:2:14/For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews
52:2:15/Who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone
52:2:16/By hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way, they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
52:2:17/But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time—in person, not in heart—we endeavored all the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face.
52:2:18/For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but Satan blocked our way.
52:2:19/For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
52:2:20/Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
52:3:1/So, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we decided to stay behind in Athens by ourselves;
52:3:2/And we sent Timothy, our brother, God's coworker in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,
52:3:3/So that no one would be shaken by these troubles. For you know that we are destined for this.
52:3:4/Indeed, when we were with you, we warned you that we would face hardships, just as it has happened, and you know.
52:3:5/That's why, when I couldn't stand it any longer, I sent to find out about your faith, fearing that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our efforts had been wasted.
52:3:6/But now that Timothy has come to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and love, and that you always remember us fondly and long to see us, just as we long to see you,
52:3:7/Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and affliction, we were encouraged about you because of your faith.
52:3:8/Now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
52:3:9/What thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy we feel before our God because of you,
52:3:10/Praying earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?
52:3:11/May God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, clear the way for us to come to you.
52:3:12/And may the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.
52:3:13/So that he may strengthen your hearts to be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.
52:4:1/We urge you, brothers and sisters, and encourage you in the Lord Jesus, to live in a way that pleases God, just as you learned from us, and to do so more and more.
52:4:2/You know the instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
52:4:3/God's will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all sexual sin.
52:4:4/Each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
52:4:5/not driven by passionate lust like the people who do not know God.
52:4:6/And in this matter, no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before.
52:4:7/God did not call us to live impure lives, but to be holy.
52:4:8/So anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
52:4:9/Regarding love for each other, you don’t need me to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.
52:4:10/And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,
52:4:11/and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you,
52:4:12/so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
52:4:13/I don’t want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
52:4:14/For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
52:4:15/According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
52:4:16/For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
52:4:17/After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
52:4:18/Therefore encourage one another with these words.
52:5:1/But regarding the times and seasons, friends, you don't need me to write to you.
52:5:2/For you know very well that the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night.
52:5:3/When people are saying, "Everything is peaceful and secure," then sudden destruction will hit them, as suddenly as labor pains come to a pregnant woman, and they won't be able to escape.
52:5:4/But you, friends, are not in the dark, so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
52:5:5/You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
52:5:6/So then, let's not sleep as others do, but let's stay awake and be sober.
52:5:7/For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
52:5:8/But since we belong to the day, let's be sober, wearing faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
52:5:9/God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
52:5:10/Who died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we might live together with him.
52:5:11/Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
52:5:12/And we urge you, friends, to recognize those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who advise you.
52:5:13/And to hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.
52:5:14/Now we encourage you, friends, warn those who are idle, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
52:5:15/Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
52:5:16/Always be joyful.
52:5:17/Pray continually.
52:5:18/Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
52:5:19/Do not stifle the Spirit.
52:5:20/Do not treat prophecies with contempt.
52:5:21/Test everything; hold on to what is good.
52:5:22/Stay away from every kind of evil.
52:5:23/May the God of peace himself make you completely holy; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
52:5:24/The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
52:5:25/Friends, pray for us.
52:5:26/Greet all the friends with a holy kiss.
52:5:27/I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
52:5:28/May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
53:1:1/Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
53:1:2/Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53:1:3/We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, because your faith is growing incredibly, and the love each one of you has for one another is overflowing.
53:1:4/So much so that we boast about you in God's churches for your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and hardships you are going through.
53:1:5/This clearly shows God's righteous judgment and that you are deemed worthy of God's kingdom, for which you are also suffering.
53:1:6/It is only fair for God to repay those who are causing you trouble with trouble of their own,
53:1:7/And to give relief to you who are troubled, along with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his powerful angels,
53:1:8/In blazing fire, taking vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
53:1:9/They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
53:1:10/When he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.
53:1:11/That's why we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and powerfully fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith.
53:1:12/So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53:2:1/Now we urge you, brothers and sisters, considering the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together with him,
53:2:2/Don't be quickly unsettled or alarmed, whether by a spirit, a message, or a letter pretending to be from us, claiming that the day of the Lord is already here.
53:2:3/Don't let anyone deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless there is a great rebellion first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the one doomed to destruction.
53:2:4/He opposes and exalts himself above everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
53:2:5/Don't you remember that when I was still with you, I used to tell you these things?
53:2:6/And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
53:2:7/For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
53:2:8/And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
53:2:9/The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,
53:2:10/and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
53:2:11/For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie,
53:2:12/so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
53:2:13/But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
53:2:14/He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
53:2:15/So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.
53:2:16/May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
53:2:17/encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
53:3:1/Finally, friends, pray for us, so that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it has been with you.
53:3:2/And that we may be rescued from unreasonable and evil people, for not everyone has faith.
53:3:3/But the Lord is reliable, who will strengthen you and protect you from harm.
53:3:4/We are confident in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we ask of you.
53:3:5/May the Lord guide your hearts to God's love and the patient waiting for Christ.
53:3:6/Now we instruct you, friends, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any believer who lives in idleness and not according to the tradition they received from us.
53:3:7/You yourselves know how you should imitate us because we were not idle among you.
53:3:8/We didn't eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, we worked hard day and night, not to be a burden to any of you.
53:3:9/It's not that we don't have the right, but we wanted to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.
53:3:10/Even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: "If anyone is not willing to work, let them not eat."
53:3:11/We hear that some among you are living in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies.
53:3:12/Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own food.
53:3:13/But you, friends, do not grow tired of doing good.
53:3:14/If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with them, so they may feel ashamed.
53:3:15/Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as a fellow believer.
53:3:16/May the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
53:3:17/This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. It is a sign in every letter; this is how I write.
53:3:18/May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
54:1:1/Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, our hope;
54:1:2/To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
54:1:3/I urged you to stay in Ephesus when I went to Macedonia so you could instruct certain people not to teach different doctrines,
54:1:4/Nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which lead to more questions than godly edification through faith. So do.
54:1:5/The goal of this command is love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.
54:1:6/Some have strayed from these and turned to meaningless talk;
54:1:7/They want to be teachers of the law, but they don't understand what they are saying or what they confidently affirm.
54:1:8/But we know that the law is good if one uses it properly;
54:1:9/Understanding that the law is not set for the righteous but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
54:1:10/For the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for anything else that opposes sound teaching;
54:1:11/In line with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, entrusted to me.
54:1:12/And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service.
54:1:13/Even though I was once a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
54:1:14/The grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
54:1:15/This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst.
54:1:16/But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.
54:1:17/Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
54:1:18/This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by recalling them you may fight the good fight,
54:1:19/Holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith.
54:1:20/Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
54:2:1/I strongly encourage that, above all, requests, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of gratitude be made for everyone;
54:2:2/For leaders, and for all those in positions of power; so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and sincerity.
54:2:3/This is pleasing and acceptable in the eyes of God our Savior;
54:2:4/Who desires everyone to be saved and to understand the truth.
54:2:5/For there is only one God, and one mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus;
54:2:6/Who sacrificed himself as a ransom for everyone, a fact that will be confirmed at the right time.
54:2:7/For this purpose, I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
54:2:8/Therefore, I want men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or doubt.
54:2:9/Similarly, women should dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes;
54:2:10/But rather, by doing good deeds, as is appropriate for women professing to honor God.
54:2:11/Women should learn quietly and with complete submission.
54:2:12/But I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be quiet.
54:2:13/For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
54:2:14/And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression.
54:2:15/However, she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with propriety.
54:3:1/This is a true saying, If a man desires the role of a bishop, he is aspiring to a noble task.
54:3:2/A bishop then must be beyond reproach, married to one wife, alert, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach;
54:3:3/Not addicted to wine, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain; but patient, not quarrelsome, not greedy;
54:3:4/Someone who manages his own household competently, keeping his children respectful and disciplined;
54:3:5/(For if a man doesn't know how to manage his own family, how can he care for God's church?)
54:3:6/Not a recent convert, so he won't become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
54:3:7/Furthermore, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so he doesn't fall into disgrace and the devil's trap.
54:3:8/Likewise, deacons must be dignified, not deceitful, not addicted to much wine, not chasing dishonest gain;
54:3:9/Keeping the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
54:3:10/And they must also be tested first; then, if found blameless, they can serve as deacons.
54:3:11/In the same way, their wives must be dignified, not malicious talkers, sober-minded, faithful in all respects.
54:3:12/Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.
54:3:13/For those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
54:3:14/These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon.
54:3:15/But if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
54:3:16/And without doubt, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
54:4:1/The Spirit clearly says that in later times, some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.
54:4:2/They will tell lies with a straight face; their consciences are as dead as burned wood.
54:4:3/They will say it's wrong to marry and order people to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be enjoyed with gratitude by those who believe and understand the truth.
54:4:4/Every creation of God is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thankfulness.
54:4:5/It is made holy by God's word and prayer.
54:4:6/If you remind the believers of these things, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished on the truths of the faith and the good teaching you have followed.
54:4:7/But reject silly myths and focus on training yourself to be godly.
54:4:8/Physical training has some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
54:4:9/This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
54:4:10/That's why we work hard and endure criticism, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially those who believe.
54:4:11/Command and teach these things.
54:4:12/Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
54:4:13/Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.
54:4:14/Do not neglect your gift, which was given to you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
54:4:15/Think about these things; immerse yourself in them, so that everyone can see your progress.
54:4:16/Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
54:5:1/Do not harshly criticize an elder, but appeal to him as you would to a father; treat younger men as brothers.
54:5:2/Treat older women as mothers; younger women as sisters, with complete respect.
54:5:3/Show respect to widows who are truly in need.
54:5:4/But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn first to show godliness at home and to repay their parents; this is pleasing in the sight of God.
54:5:5/A widow who is truly alone puts her hope in God and continues to pray and ask for help night and day.
54:5:6/But a widow who indulges in a life of pleasure is spiritually dead even while she lives.
54:5:7/Teach these things as well, so they may be above reproach.
54:5:8/But if anyone does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, they have denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever.
54:5:9/Do not enroll a widow under sixty years old, and only if she has been faithful to her husband.
54:5:10/She must be well-known for her good deeds, such as raising children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of God's people, helping those in trouble, and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
54:5:11/But refuse to enroll younger widows; for when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.
54:5:12/Thus, they bring judgment on themselves because they have broken their first pledge.
54:5:13/Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and meddlers, saying things they should not.
54:5:14/So I counsel younger widows to marry, have children, manage their homes, and give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
54:5:15/Some have already strayed after Satan.
54:5:16/If any believer, man or woman, has widows in their family, they should support them and not burden the church, so the church can help those widows who are really in need.
54:5:17/Elders who lead effectively are worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in preaching and teaching.
54:5:18/For Scripture says, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and "The worker deserves their wages."
54:5:19/Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
54:5:20/Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of everyone, so that others may take warning.
54:5:21/I solemnly charge you in the presence of God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels to observe these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism.
54:5:22/Do not be hasty in laying on hands, nor share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
54:5:23/Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
54:5:24/The sins of some people are obvious, leading them to judgment; the sins of others trail behind them.
54:5:25/In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.
54:6:1/Let all employees under authority respect their employers fully, so that God's name and teachings are not disrespected.
54:6:2/And those with employers who are believers should not disrespect them because they are fellow believers; instead, they should serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are faithful and loved. Teach and encourage these things.
54:6:3/If anyone teaches differently and doesn't agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that aligns with godliness;
54:6:4/They are arrogant, lacking understanding, but obsessed with arguments and disputes over words, which lead to envy, conflict, insults, and malicious speculation,
54:6:5/Corrupt and misguided discussions by people with corrupt minds and a lack of truth, who think that financial gain is the same as godliness: stay away from such people.
54:6:6/But true godliness with contentment is itself a great wealth.
54:6:7/For we brought nothing into this world, and it's certain we can take nothing out.
54:6:8/So, if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.
54:6:9/But those who want to get rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction.
54:6:10/For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
54:6:11/But you, man of God, run away from all this; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
54:6:12/Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
54:6:13/I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession,
54:6:14/To keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
54:6:15/Which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
54:6:16/Who alone is immortal and lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.
54:6:17/Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
54:6:18/Tell them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.
54:6:19/In this way, they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
54:6:20/O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,
54:6:21/Which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
55:1:1/Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, because of the promise of life found in Christ Jesus,
55:1:2/To Timothy, my dearly loved son: Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
55:1:3/I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, that I constantly remember you in my prayers day and night;
55:1:4/Eagerly wanting to see you, remembering your tears, so I can be filled with joy;
55:1:5/Remembering your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced, is in you as well.
55:1:6/So I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands.
55:1:7/For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-discipline.
55:1:8/So don't be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, share in the suffering for the gospel by the power of God,
55:1:9/Who has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,
55:1:10/But has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
55:1:11/For this gospel, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
55:1:12/That's why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
55:1:13/Keep the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
55:1:14/Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
55:1:15/You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
55:1:16/May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
55:1:17/On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.
55:1:18/May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
55:2:1/So you, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
55:2:2/And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.
55:2:3/So endure hardship, like a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
55:2:4/No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs; they aim to please their commanding officer.
55:2:5/And if someone competes as an athlete, they are not crowned unless they compete according to the rules.
55:2:6/The farmer who works hard should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
55:2:7/Think about what I'm saying; and may the Lord give you insight into all this.
55:2:8/Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,
55:2:9/For which I am suffering to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained.
55:2:10/Therefore, I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
55:2:11/This saying is trustworthy: If we died with him, we will also live with him;
55:2:12/If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;
55:2:13/If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
55:2:14/Remind them of these things, charging them before God not to argue about words, which does no good but only ruins those who listen.
55:2:15/Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.
55:2:16/But avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.
55:2:17/Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
55:2:18/Who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.
55:2:19/Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”
55:2:20/In a large house, there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use.
55:2:21/Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.
55:2:22/Run away from the desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
55:2:23/But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.
55:2:24/And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful,
55:2:25/Gently instructing those who oppose themselves, in case God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth,
55:2:26/And that they may come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
55:3:1/Be aware that in the final days, dangerous times will come.
55:3:2/People will be self-centered, greedy, boastful, arrogant, disrespectful, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, and irreverent,
55:3:3/Lacking empathy, untrustworthy, slanderous, lacking self-control, brutal, and hostile towards the virtuous,
55:3:4/Betrayers, reckless, conceited, preferring pleasure over devotion to God;
55:3:5/They will appear religious but reject the true power of faith: avoid such people.
55:3:6/These are the ones who exploit vulnerable individuals, ensnaring them with their sins and various desires,
55:3:7/Always learning but never able to grasp the truth.
55:3:8/Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, these individuals resist the truth: they have corrupt minds and fail the test of faith.
55:3:9/However, they won't get far, as their foolishness will become obvious to everyone, just as it did with those two.
55:3:10/But you are well acquainted with my teaching, way of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,
55:3:11/And the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all.
55:3:12/Indeed, anyone who desires to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face persecution.
55:3:13/But wicked individuals and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves.
55:3:14/However, you should continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing who taught you,
55:3:15/And remembering that from childhood, you have known the Holy Scriptures, which can give you wisdom leading to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
55:3:16/All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness,
55:3:17/So that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
55:4:1/I urge you in the presence of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead when he appears and establishes his kingdom;
55:4:2/Preach the message; be ready at all times; correct, warn, and encourage with great patience and careful instruction.
55:4:3/For a time is coming when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
55:4:4/They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
55:4:5/But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully carry out your ministry.
55:4:6/For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near.
55:4:7/I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
55:4:8/Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
55:4:9/Make every effort to come to me soon.
55:4:10/For Demas has deserted me because he loved this present world and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
55:4:11/Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
55:4:12/I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
55:4:13/When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments.
55:4:14/Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. May the Lord repay him according to his actions.
55:4:15/Be on your guard against him too, because he strongly opposed our message.
55:4:16/At my first defense, no one came to support me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.
55:4:17/But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.
55:4:18/The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
55:4:19/Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
55:4:20/Erastus stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
55:4:21/Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.
55:4:22/May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
56:1:1/Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, following the faith of God's chosen ones, and recognizing the truth that leads to a godly life;
56:1:2/In hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before time began;
56:1:3/But has at the right time revealed his word through preaching, entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior;
56:1:4/To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
56:1:5/The reason I left you in Crete was so you could straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
56:1:6/If anyone is blameless, faithful to one wife, with children who are believers not accused of wild living or rebellion.
56:1:7/For an overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not arrogant, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
56:1:8/But hospitable, a lover of what is good, self-controlled, upright, holy, disciplined;
56:1:9/Holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound teaching and refute those who oppose it.
56:1:10/For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group;
56:1:11/They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—for the sake of dishonest gain.
56:1:12/One of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons."
56:1:13/This statement is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so they will be sound in the faith;
56:1:14/Not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth.
56:1:15/To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
56:1:16/They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for doing anything good.
56:2:1/But talk about the things that align with healthy teaching:
56:2:2/Encourage older men to be self-controlled, dignified, wise, strong in faith, in love, and in endurance.
56:2:3/Similarly, older women should behave in a way that reflects holiness, not spreading rumors, not overindulging in wine, and teaching what is good.
56:2:4/So they can guide younger women to be self-controlled, to love their husbands and children,
56:2:5/To be sensible, pure, managing their households well, kind, and to be supportive of their husbands, so that no one can criticize the word of God.
56:2:6/Encourage young men as well to be level-headed.
56:2:7/Show yourself as an example of good actions in everything. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness, and sincerity,
56:2:8/Use speech that is beyond reproach, so that anyone opposing you may be embarrassed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
56:2:9/Urge workers to be respectful to their employers, to try to please them in every way, not talking back,
56:2:10/Not stealing, but showing that they can be completely trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
56:2:11/For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,
56:2:12/Teaching us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this current age,
56:2:13/While we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
56:2:14/Who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
56:2:15/Talk about these things, encourage, and correct with full authority. Don't let anyone disregard you.
56:3:1/Remind them to respect and obey those in authority, to follow the laws, and to be ready to do good deeds,
56:3:2/To not badmouth anyone, to avoid fighting, but to be gentle, showing kindness to everyone.
56:3:3/For we were once foolish, disobedient, misled, chasing after various desires and pleasures, living in malice and jealousy, detestable, and detesting one another.
56:3:4/But then the kindness and love of God our Savior for humanity was revealed,
56:3:5/Not because of righteous deeds we had done, but because of His mercy He saved us, through the cleansing of a new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
56:3:6/Whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56:3:7/So that, being justified by His grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
56:3:8/This saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are beneficial for everyone.
56:3:9/But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the law, because they are unproductive and useless.
56:3:10/Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,
56:3:11/Knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; they condemn themselves.
56:3:12/When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
56:3:13/Help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey thoroughly, so that they lack nothing.
56:3:14/And let our people also learn to engage in good deeds to meet urgent needs, so that they will not be unproductive.
56:3:15/Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with you all. Amen.
57:1:1/Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow worker,
57:1:2/And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
57:1:3/Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57:1:4/I thank my God, always mentioning you in my prayers,
57:1:5/Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
57:1:6/So that the sharing of your faith may become effective by recognizing every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.
57:1:7/For we have great joy and comfort in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
57:1:8/Therefore, although I could be very bold in Christ to command you to do what is proper,
57:1:9/I prefer to appeal to you out of love, being such a person as Paul, now an old man, and also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
57:1:10/I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have fathered while in my chains,
57:1:11/Who in the past was useless to you, but now is useful to both you and me.
57:1:12/I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
57:1:13/I wanted to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he might serve me while I am in chains for the gospel.
57:1:14/But I didn't want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be by compulsion, but of your own free will.
57:1:15/Perhaps he was separated from you for a while for this reason, that you might have him back forever,
57:1:16/No longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
57:1:17/If you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57:1:18/If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account;
57:1:19/I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
57:1:20/Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.
57:1:21/Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
57:1:22/And also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.
57:1:23/Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings;
57:1:24/Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers, send you their greetings.
57:1:25/The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
58:1:1/God, who at various times and in different ways spoke in the past to our ancestors through the prophets,
58:1:2/Has in these last days spoken to us through his Son, whom he has appointed heir of everything, through whom he also created the universe.
58:1:3/Who being the radiance of his glory, and the exact representation of his being, and sustaining all things by his powerful word, after he had provided purification for sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.
58:1:4/Becoming so much superior to the angels, as he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.
58:1:5/For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son, today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?
58:1:6/And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
58:1:7/Regarding the angels he says, "He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire."
58:1:8/But to the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom."
58:1:9/You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.
58:1:10/And, "You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands;
58:1:11/They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment;
58:1:12/You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never end."
58:1:13/But to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
58:1:14/Aren't they all ministering spirits, sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
58:2:1/So, we should pay much closer attention to what we have heard, to prevent us from drifting away.
58:2:2/Because if the message delivered by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received a fair punishment;
58:2:3/How can we possibly escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.
58:2:4/God also testified to it by signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributed according to his will.
58:2:5/He did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.
58:2:6/But someone has testified somewhere, saying, "What is mankind that you are mindful of them, or the son of man that you care for him?
58:2:7/You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor and put everything under his feet."
58:2:8/In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present, we do not see everything subject to him.
58:2:9/But we do see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58:2:10/It was fitting for him, for whom and through whom everything exists, in bringing many children to glory, to perfect the pioneer of their salvation through sufferings.
58:2:11/For both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,
58:2:12/Saying, "I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises."
58:2:13/And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."
58:2:14/Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—
58:2:15/And free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
58:2:16/For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.
58:2:17/For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
58:2:18/Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
58:3:1/Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, pay attention to the Apostle and High Priest of our faith, Jesus Christ;
58:3:2/He was loyal to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was loyal in all God's household.
58:3:3/This man, Jesus, was considered more glorious than Moses because the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
58:3:4/Indeed, every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
58:3:5/And Moses was indeed faithful in all God's household as a servant, to bear witness to what would be spoken later;
58:3:6/But Christ is faithful as a son over his own house; and we are his house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the joy of our hope until the end.
58:3:7/Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
58:3:8/Do not harden your hearts as you did during the rebellion, on the day of testing in the desert,
58:3:9/Where your ancestors tested and tried me, though they had seen my works for forty years.
58:3:10/That is why I was angry with that generation and said, 'Their hearts always go astray, and they have not known my ways.'
58:3:11/So in my anger, I took an oath: 'They shall never enter my rest.'"
58:3:12/Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
58:3:13/But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.
58:3:14/We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end.
58:3:15/As it has been said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."
58:3:16/Indeed, some who heard the message provoked God. However, not all who came out of Egypt with Moses did so.
58:3:17/But with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?
58:3:18/And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?
58:3:19/So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
58:4:1/So, let's be cautious, because there's a promise of entering into his rest, and we wouldn't want any of you to miss out.
58:4:2/The good news was shared with us just as it was with them. However, the message they heard didn't benefit them because they didn't mix it with faith.
58:4:3/For those of us who have believed are entering that rest, as he has said, "I swore in my anger, they shall never enter my rest," even though his works were completed from the creation of the world.
58:4:4/He mentioned the seventh day specifically, saying, "And on the seventh day, God rested from all his works."
58:4:5/And again, in this context, "They shall never enter my rest."
58:4:6/It still stands that some will enter that rest, and those who first heard the good news failed to enter because of their disbelief.
58:4:7/He sets a specific day, "Today," through David after such a long time; as it has been said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58:4:8/If Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day later on.
58:4:9/So, there is still a rest available for the people of God.
58:4:10/For anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.
58:4:11/Therefore, let's make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.
58:4:12/For the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
58:4:13/And there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
58:4:14/Since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let's hold firmly to the faith we profess.
58:4:15/For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.
58:4:16/So, let's approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
58:5:1/Every high priest is chosen from among people to serve on behalf of others in matters related to God, so that he can offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58:5:2/He can empathize with those who are ignorant or have strayed because he himself is also subject to weakness.
58:5:3/And for this reason, he must offer sacrifices for sins, not just for the people, but also for himself.
58:5:4/And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.
58:5:5/In the same way, Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your father."
58:5:6/As he also says in another passage, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
58:5:7/In his earthly life, he offered prayers and pleas with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
58:5:8/Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered.
58:5:9/And having been perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
58:5:10/Being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
58:5:11/We have much to say about this, but it's difficult to explain because you have become slow to understand.
58:5:12/By now, you should be teachers, but you need someone to teach you the basic principles of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food.
58:5:13/Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.
58:5:14/But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
58:6:1/So, let's move beyond the basic teachings about Christ and advance toward maturity, not laying again the groundwork of turning away from useless actions and believing in God,
58:6:2/Including teachings about different baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58:6:3/And we will do this, if God allows.
58:6:4/For it's impossible for those who have once been enlightened, experienced the heavenly gift, and shared in the Holy Spirit,
58:6:5/And have savored the good message of God and the powers of the coming age,
58:6:6/If they fall away, to bring them back to repentance, since they are re-crucifying the Son of God for themselves and publicly disgracing him.
58:6:7/Just as the earth absorbs the rain that frequently falls on it and produces useful crops for those who farm it, receiving blessings from God,
58:6:8/But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and close to being cursed; its end is to be burned.
58:6:9/However, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—things that have to do with salvation, even though we speak like this.
58:6:10/For God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
58:6:11/And we want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized.
58:6:12/We don't want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
58:6:13/When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,
58:6:14/Saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."
58:6:15/And so, after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
58:6:16/People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
58:6:17/Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.
58:6:18/So that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.
58:6:19/We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
58:6:20/Where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
58:7:1/For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him.
58:7:2/To whom Abraham also gave a tenth of everything. He was first named King of Righteousness, and then also King of Salem, meaning King of Peace.
58:7:3/He had no father or mother, no genealogy, no beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
58:7:4/Now think about how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the plunder.
58:7:5/Indeed, those who are descendants of Levi, who receive the priestly office, have a command to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their own brothers, even though they also are descended from Abraham.
58:7:6/But this man, whose lineage is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises.
58:7:7/And without any doubt, the lesser is blessed by the greater.
58:7:8/Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he receives them, of whom it is testified that he lives.
58:7:9/And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes.
58:7:10/For he was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchisedec met him.
58:7:11/If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchisedec, not in the order of Aaron?
58:7:12/For when there is a change in the priesthood, there must also be a change in the law.
58:7:13/He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
58:7:14/For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
58:7:15/And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchisedec appears,
58:7:16/One who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.
58:7:17/For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchisedec."
58:7:18/The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
58:7:19/(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.
58:7:20/And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
58:7:21/but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'"
58:7:22/Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.
58:7:23/Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;
58:7:24/but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
58:7:25/Therefore, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.
58:7:26/Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
58:7:27/Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.
58:7:28/For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
58:8:1/To sum up what we've discussed: We have a high priest seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven.
58:8:2/This high priest serves in the sanctuary and the true tent set up by the Lord, not by humans.
58:8:3/Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices, so it's necessary for this one to have something to offer as well.
58:8:4/If he were on earth, he wouldn't be a priest at all, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law.
58:8:5/These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to build the tabernacle: "Make sure you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain."
58:8:6/But now, he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much more as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.
58:8:7/If the first covenant had been perfect, there would have been no need for a second one.
58:8:8/But God found fault with the people and said: "The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."
58:8:9/It won't be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they didn't remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, says the Lord.
58:8:10/This is the covenant I will establish with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
58:8:11/No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
58:8:12/For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.
58:8:13/By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.
58:9:1/Indeed, the first agreement also had its own rituals of worship and a physical place of worship.
58:9:2/There was a tent set up; the first part contained the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread; this is known as the sanctuary.
58:9:3/Beyond the second curtain was the tent called the Most Holy Place;
58:9:4/Which housed the golden incense altar, and the ark of the covenant covered all around with gold, in which was the golden jar holding manna, Aaron’s rod that sprouted, and the stone tablets of the covenant;
58:9:5/And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the atonement cover; about these things we cannot now go into detail.
58:9:6/When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always entered the first part of the tent to carry out their religious duties.
58:9:7/But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
58:9:8/The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent was still functioning.
58:9:9/This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
58:9:10/They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
58:9:11/But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things that are now already here, by a greater and more perfect tent not made with human hands, that is to say, not a part of this creation.
58:9:12/He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.
58:9:13/For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean,
58:9:14/How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!
58:9:15/For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
58:9:16/In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,
58:9:17/Because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is alive.
58:9:18/This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
58:9:19/When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,
58:9:20/Saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you to keep."
58:9:21/In the same way, he sprinkled with blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
58:9:22/In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
58:9:23/It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
58:9:24/For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.
58:9:25/Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
58:9:26/Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
58:9:27/Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,
58:9:28/So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
58:10:1/The law, being a shadow of the good things to come and not the actual form of those realities, can never make those who approach perfect through the same sacrifices they continually offer year after year.
58:10:2/Otherwise, wouldn't they have stopped being offered, since the worshippers, once cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
58:10:3/But in those sacrifices, there is a yearly reminder of sins.
58:10:4/It's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58:10:5/Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says, "You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but you have prepared a body for me;
58:10:6/You took no pleasure in burnt offerings and sin offerings."
58:10:7/Then I said, 'Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—I have come to do your will, O God.'"
58:10:8/Previously saying, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (which are offered according to the law),
58:10:9/then he added, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second.
58:10:10/And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58:10:11/Every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
58:10:12/But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,
58:10:13/waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.
58:10:14/For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being made holy.
58:10:15/The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:
58:10:16/"This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,"
58:10:17/then he adds, "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."
58:10:18/And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.
58:10:19/Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
58:10:20/by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,
58:10:21/and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
58:10:22/let us draw near with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
58:10:23/Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
58:10:24/And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,
58:10:25/not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
58:10:26/For if we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
58:10:27/but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
58:10:28/Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
58:10:29/How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
58:10:30/For we know the one who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."
58:10:31/It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58:10:32/Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured a great conflict full of suffering;
58:10:33/sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
58:10:34/You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
58:10:35/So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
58:10:36/You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.
58:10:37/For, "In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay."
58:10:38/But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him.
58:10:39/But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.
58:11:1/Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
58:11:2/Through faith, the elders were commended.
58:11:3/By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of visible materials.
58:11:4/Through faith, Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. Through this, he was acknowledged as righteous, with God affirming his offerings. And through his faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
58:11:5/Because of his faith, Enoch was taken away so that he did not experience death; he could not be found because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.
58:11:6/But without faith, it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
58:11:7/By faith, Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith, he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
58:11:8/By faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, and he went, even though he did not know where he was going.
58:11:9/By faith, he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
58:11:10/For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58:11:11/By faith, Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.
58:11:12/And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
58:11:13/All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth.
58:11:14/People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
58:11:15/If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.
58:11:16/Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
58:11:17/By faith, Abraham, when tested, offered up Isaac—he who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his only son,
58:11:18/Of whom it was said, "Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned."
58:11:19/Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death.
58:11:20/By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
58:11:21/By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
58:11:22/By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning his bones.
58:11:23/By faith, Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
58:11:24/By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
58:11:25/He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
58:11:26/He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.
58:11:27/By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.
58:11:28/By faith, he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
58:11:29/By faith, the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
58:11:30/By faith, the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.
58:11:31/By faith, the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.
58:11:32/And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,
58:11:33/Who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,
58:11:34/Quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.
58:11:35/Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection.
58:11:36/Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.
58:11:37/They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated—
58:11:38/The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.
58:11:39/And all these, though commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised,
58:11:40/Since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
58:12:1/Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses, let's throw off every burden and the sin that so easily trips us up, and let's run with endurance the race that lies before us,
58:12:2/Focusing on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of God's throne.
58:12:3/Think about him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you won't grow tired and give up.
58:12:4/You haven't yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood in your struggle against sin.
58:12:5/And you have forgotten the encouragement that addresses you as children: "My child, do not take lightly the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
58:12:6/For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastises every child he accepts."
58:12:7/If you endure discipline, God treats you as children. For what child is not disciplined by their father?
58:12:8/But if you are not disciplined—which everyone undergoes—then you are illegitimate, not true children.
58:12:9/Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shouldn't we much more submit to the Father of spirits and live?
58:12:10/They disciplined us for a short time as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.
58:12:11/No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
58:12:12/So, strengthen your drooping hands and weak knees.
58:12:13/Make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated but rather healed.
58:12:14/Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
58:12:15/Be careful that no one falls short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;
58:12:16/Make sure that no one is sexually immoral or godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.
58:12:17/Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done.
58:12:18/You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;
58:12:19/To the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further word be spoken to them.
58:12:20/For they could not bear what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death."
58:12:21/The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear."
58:12:22/But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless angels in joyful assembly,
58:12:23/To the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
58:12:24/To Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
58:12:25/Make sure you do not refuse the One who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we turn away from the One who warns from heaven.
58:12:26/His voice then shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens."
58:12:27/This phrase, "Once more," indicates the removal of things that are shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
58:12:28/Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,
58:12:29/For our God is a consuming fire.
58:13:1/Keep showing love to each other as brothers and sisters.
58:13:2/Don't forget to welcome strangers, because by doing so, some have unknowingly welcomed angels.
58:13:3/Remember those who are imprisoned as if you were imprisoned with them, and those who are mistreated, since you are also in the body.
58:13:4/Marriage should be respected by all, and the marriage bed kept pure; for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
58:13:5/Keep your life free from the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have; for God has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
58:13:6/So we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?"
58:13:7/Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
58:13:8/Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
58:13:9/Don't be led away by various and strange teachings. It's good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by dietary rules, which haven't benefited those who follow them.
58:13:10/We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.
58:13:11/The bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, are burned outside the camp.
58:13:12/Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.
58:13:13/Let's then go out to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.
58:13:14/For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.
58:13:15/Through him, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.
58:13:16/And don't forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
58:13:17/Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.
58:13:18/Pray for us; we are convinced that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
58:13:19/I especially urge you to do this so that I may be restored to you sooner.
58:13:20/May the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,
58:13:21/equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
58:13:22/I urge you, brothers and sisters, to bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.
58:13:23/Be aware that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.
58:13:24/Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
58:13:25/May grace be with you all. Amen.
59:1:1/James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends greetings to the twelve tribes scattered around the world.
59:1:2/My brothers and sisters, consider it pure joy whenever you face various trials;
59:1:3/Knowing that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
59:1:4/But let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
59:1:5/If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.
59:1:6/But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
59:1:7/That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59:1:8/A person with divided loyalty is unsettled in all their ways.
59:1:9/Let the lowly brother or sister take pride in their high position;
59:1:10/But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wildflower.
59:1:11/For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls, and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.
59:1:12/Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
59:1:13/No one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
59:1:14/But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.
59:1:15/Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.
59:1:16/Don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.
59:1:17/Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
59:1:18/He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
59:1:19/So then, my beloved brothers and sisters, let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry,
59:1:20/For human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
59:1:21/Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the excess of wickedness, and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save your souls.
59:1:22/But don't just listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
59:1:23/Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at their face in a mirror
59:1:24/And, after looking at themselves, goes away and immediately forgets what they look like.
59:1:25/But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.
59:1:26/If anyone considers themselves religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on their tongue, they deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.
59:1:27/Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
59:2:1/My friends, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Lord, with favoritism.
59:2:2/For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes comes into your meeting, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in;
59:2:3/And you pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say, "Sit here in a good spot," but say to the poor man, "Stand over there" or "Sit at my feet";
59:2:4/Aren't you then discriminating among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
59:2:5/Listen, my dear friends, hasn't God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?
59:2:6/But you have dishonored the poor. Isn't it the rich who exploit you and drag you into court?
59:2:7/Aren't they the ones who slander the noble name by which you were called?
59:2:8/If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing right.
59:2:9/But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
59:2:10/For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.
59:2:11/For the one who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
59:2:12/So speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.
59:2:13/Because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
59:2:14/What good is it, my friends, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?
59:2:15/If a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food,
59:2:16/And one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?
59:2:17/In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
59:2:18/But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
59:2:19/You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
59:2:20/But do you want to know, you foolish person, that faith without deeds is useless?
59:2:21/Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
59:2:22/Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete?
59:2:23/And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," and he was called God's friend.
59:2:24/You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
59:2:25/In the same way, wasn't Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
59:2:26/For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without deeds is dead.
59:3:1/My friends, don't rush to become leaders, knowing that we will face stricter judgment.
59:3:2/We all make many mistakes. If anyone can speak without fault, they're perfect and can control their entire body.
59:3:3/Consider how we put bits into horses' mouths so they obey us, and we can guide their whole body.
59:3:4/Likewise, huge ships, though pushed by strong winds, are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
59:3:5/In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body but it boasts of great exploits. See how a small spark can set a great forest on fire!
59:3:6/And the tongue is a fire, a world of wrongdoing. It contaminates the whole body and sets the course of life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
59:3:7/Every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by humanity,
59:3:8/But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
59:3:9/With it we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people, who are made in God's likeness.
59:3:10/From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My friends, this should not be.
59:3:11/Can a spring pour forth both fresh and salt water from the same opening?
59:3:12/Can a fig tree, my friends, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
59:3:13/Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
59:3:14/But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
59:3:15/This kind of wisdom does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
59:3:16/For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
59:3:17/But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
59:3:18/And peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
59:4:1/Where do conflicts and quarrels among you come from? Don't they arise from your desires that battle within you?
59:4:2/You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask.
59:4:3/When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
59:4:4/You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means hostility against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
59:4:5/Do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely?
59:4:6/But he gives us more grace. That's why Scripture says: God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.
59:4:7/Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59:4:8/Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59:4:9/Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair.
59:4:10/Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
59:4:11/Do not speak evil against each other, brothers and sisters. Whoever speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
59:4:12/There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who can save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?
59:4:13/Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make money."
59:4:14/You do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
59:4:15/Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that."
59:4:16/But now you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.
59:4:17/So then, if you know the good you ought to do and don't do it, you sin.
59:5:1/Listen up, you rich people, cry and wail because of the misery that's coming your way.
59:5:2/Your wealth has rotted away, and your clothes are moth-eaten.
59:5:3/Your gold and silver have tarnished, and their rust will testify against you and consume your flesh like fire. You've hoarded wealth in these last days.
59:5:4/Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
59:5:5/You've lived in luxury and self-indulgence on the earth. You've fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter.
59:5:6/You've condemned and murdered the righteous, who did not resist you.
59:5:7/So be patient, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains.
59:5:8/You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.
59:5:9/Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
59:5:10/Brothers and sisters, take the prophets who spoke in the Lord's name as an example of patience in the face of suffering.
59:5:11/As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
59:5:12/Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your "yes" be yes, and your "no," no, or you will be condemned.
59:5:13/Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise.
59:5:14/Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
59:5:15/And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
59:5:16/Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
59:5:17/Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
59:5:18/Then he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
59:5:19/Brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back,
59:5:20/remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
60:1:1/Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who are living as foreigners scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
60:1:2/Chosen according to God the Father's foreknowledge, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience and for the sprinkling with Jesus Christ's blood: May grace and peace be abundantly yours.
60:1:3/Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in his great mercy has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
60:1:4/To an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
60:1:5/Who are protected by God's power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
60:1:6/In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
60:1:7/So that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that perishes even though refined by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
60:1:8/Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
60:1:9/For you are receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
60:1:10/Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with great care,
60:1:11/Trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.
60:1:12/It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
60:1:13/Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
60:1:14/As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
60:1:15/But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;
60:1:16/For it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy."
60:1:17/And if you call on the Father, who judges each person's work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear.
60:1:18/For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,
60:1:19/But with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
60:1:20/He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
60:1:21/Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.
60:1:22/Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart.
60:1:23/For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.
60:1:24/For all people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,
60:1:25/But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.
60:2:1/So, put away all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all forms of slander.
60:2:2/Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up into salvation—
60:2:3/if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
60:2:4/As you come to him, a living stone rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him,
60:2:5/you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
60:2:6/For it stands in Scripture: "Look, I am laying in Zion a chosen, precious cornerstone; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
60:2:7/So then, for you who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"
60:2:8/and "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
60:2:9/But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
60:2:10/Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
60:2:11/Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
60:2:12/Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
60:2:13/Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,
60:2:14/or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
60:2:15/For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
60:2:16/Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.
60:2:17/Respect everyone, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the emperor.
60:2:18/Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
60:2:19/For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
60:2:20/For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a grace before God.
60:2:21/For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
60:2:22/He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
60:2:23/When he was insulted, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to the one who judges justly.
60:2:24/He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.
60:2:25/For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
60:3:1/Similarly, wives, be supportive of your own husbands; so that even if some do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,
60:3:2/When they see your pure and respectful behavior.
60:3:3/Do not let your beauty come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
60:3:4/Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.
60:3:5/For this is how the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands,
60:3:6/Like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
60:3:7/Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker partner, since they are heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
60:3:8/Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.
60:3:9/Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
60:3:10/For whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.
60:3:11/Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
60:3:12/For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
60:3:13/Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
60:3:14/But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened.
60:3:15/But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,
60:3:16/Keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
60:3:17/For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
60:3:18/For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit,
60:3:19/Through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,
60:3:20/Who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water,
60:3:21/And this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
60:3:22/Who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities, and powers in submission to him.
60:4:1/Since Christ suffered in the flesh for us, you should also prepare yourself with the same mindset: because someone who has suffered in the flesh is done with sin;
60:4:2/So that they no longer spend their remaining life chasing human desires, but doing the will of God.
60:4:3/The time we've already spent living like non-believers should be enough, when we indulged in sexual immorality, lusts, excessive drinking, wild parties, feasting, and detestable idol worship;
60:4:4/They find it odd that you don't join them in their reckless, wild living and they badmouth you for it;
60:4:5/They will have to explain themselves to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
60:4:6/This is why the Good News was also preached to those who are now dead, so that although they were judged in the flesh like everyone else, they might live in the spirit according to God's will.
60:4:7/But the end of all things is near: so be self-controlled and alert for prayer.
60:4:8/Most importantly, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.
60:4:9/Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
60:4:10/Just as each one has received a gift, use it to serve others, as good managers of God's varied grace.
60:4:11/If anyone speaks, they should do so as one conveying the words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
60:4:12/Dear friends, don't be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
60:4:13/But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, so that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
60:4:14/If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. They may slander him, but you glorify him.
60:4:15/Make sure none of you suffers as a murderer, thief, criminal, or as a meddler in other people's affairs.
60:4:16/However, if anyone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed, but should glorify God because of it.
60:4:17/For it's time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it starts with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
60:4:18/And if it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?
60:4:19/So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
60:5:1/I urge the elders among you, as a fellow elder and witness of Christ's sufferings, and one who will share in the glory to come:
60:5:2/Take care of God's flock that is under your care, watching over them not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;
60:5:3/Not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
60:5:4/And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
60:5:5/In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.
60:5:6/So humble yourselves under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
60:5:7/Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
60:5:8/Stay alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
60:5:9/Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
60:5:10/And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.
60:5:11/To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
60:5:12/Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.
60:5:13/The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son Mark.
60:5:14/Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
61:1:1/Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:
61:1:2/May grace and peace be abundantly increased to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
61:1:3/As His divine power has granted us everything necessary for life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness.
61:1:4/Through these, He has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
61:1:5/For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue; and virtue with knowledge;
61:1:6/And knowledge with self-control; and self-control with endurance; and endurance with godliness;
61:1:7/And godliness with brotherly affection; and brotherly affection with love.
61:1:8/For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective or unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
61:1:9/But anyone who does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.
61:1:10/Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble,
61:1:11/And you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
61:1:12/So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.
61:1:13/I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,
61:1:14/Knowing that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
61:1:15/And I will make every effort to ensure that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
61:1:16/For we did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
61:1:17/For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
61:1:18/We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
61:1:19/We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
61:1:20/Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things.
61:1:21/For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
61:2:1/But there were false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who redeemed them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
61:2:2/And many will follow their destructive ways, because of which the way of truth will be maligned.
61:2:3/Driven by greed, they will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction is not asleep.
61:2:4/For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell, delivering them to chains of darkness to be held for judgment;
61:2:5/And did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
61:2:6/And if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;
61:2:7/And rescued righteous Lot, distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless
61:2:8/(For that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard);
61:2:9/The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,
61:2:10/Especially those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings.
61:2:11/Even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment before the Lord.
61:2:12/But these people, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct born to be caught and destroyed, slander what they do not understand, and will perish in their own corruption,
61:2:13/They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
61:2:14/With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood!
61:2:15/They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness.
61:2:16/But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
61:2:17/These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
61:2:18/For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error.
61:2:19/They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.
61:2:20/If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, the final state is worse for them than the first.
61:2:21/It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.
61:2:22/But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: "A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud."
61:3:1/This second letter, dear friends, I am writing to you; in both, I aim to refresh your pure minds by reminding you:
61:3:2/So that you remember the words previously spoken by the holy prophets, and the command given by us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior:
61:3:3/Firstly, understand that in the last days, there will be mockers, driven by their own desires,
61:3:4/And they will ask, "Where is the promise of His coming? For since our ancestors died, everything has remained the same since the world was created."
61:3:5/They choose to ignore that long ago, by God's word, the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
61:3:6/Through which the world of that time was flooded and destroyed.
61:3:7/But by the same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of godless people.
61:3:8/But, dear friends, do not forget this one thing: that with the Lord, a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
61:3:9/The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
61:3:10/But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day, the heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
61:3:11/Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives,
61:3:12/As you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. On that day, the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.
61:3:13/But in keeping with His promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
61:3:14/Therefore, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with Him.
61:3:15/Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom given to him,
61:3:16/As he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.
61:3:17/Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position.
61:3:18/But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
62:1:1/What has been from the start, what we've heard, seen with our own eyes, observed closely, and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of life;
62:1:2/(Because the life was revealed, and we've seen it, and testify to it, and tell you about the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us;)
62:1:3/What we've seen and heard, we share with you, so you too can have a connection with us. And indeed, our connection is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
62:1:4/We write these things to you so that your joy may be complete.
62:1:5/So, this is the message we've heard from him and announce to you: that God is light, and there's absolutely no darkness in him.
62:1:6/If we claim to have a relationship with him but live in the darkness, we're lying and not practicing the truth.
62:1:7/But if we live in the light, just as he is in the light, we have a relationship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.
62:1:8/If we claim to be without sin, we're fooling ourselves, and the truth isn't in us.
62:1:9/If we admit our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wrongdoing.
62:1:10/If we claim we haven't sinned, we're calling him a liar, and his message isn't in us.
62:2:1/My dear children, I'm writing this to you so that you won't sin. But if anyone does sin, we have Jesus Christ, the Righteous One, who pleads our case with the Father.
62:2:2/And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the entire world.
62:2:3/This is how we know that we truly know him: if we keep his commandments.
62:2:4/Anyone who says, "I know him," but doesn't follow his commandments is lying, and the truth isn't in that person.
62:2:5/But whoever obeys his word, truly in this person the love of God has reached perfection. By this we know we are in him.
62:2:6/Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.
62:2:7/Dear friends, I'm not writing you a new commandment, but an old one you've had from the start. This old commandment is the message you've heard before.
62:2:8/Yet, I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining.
62:2:9/Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness.
62:2:10/Whoever loves their brother or sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble.
62:2:11/But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.
62:2:12/I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
62:2:13/I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father.
62:2:14/I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
62:2:15/Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in them.
62:2:16/For everything in the world—the cravings of sinful people, the lust of their eyes, and their boasting about what they have and do—comes not from the Father but from the world.
62:2:17/And the world with its desires passes away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
62:2:18/Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.
62:2:19/They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
62:2:20/But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
62:2:21/I am not writing to you because you don't know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth.
62:2:22/Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son.
62:2:23/No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father as well.
62:2:24/So then, let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
62:2:25/And this is what he promised us—eternal life.
62:2:26/I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.
62:2:27/As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.
62:2:28/And now, dear children, continue to live in him, so that when he appears we can be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
62:2:29/If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
62:3:1/Look at the incredible love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God: and so we are. The reason the world doesn't recognize us is that it didn't recognize him.
62:3:2/Dear friends, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. But we know that when he appears, we will be like him, because we will see him as he truly is.
62:3:3/And everyone who has this hope in him purifies themselves, just as he is pure.
62:3:4/Anyone who sins is also breaking the law, because sin is lawlessness.
62:3:5/And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him, there is no sin.
62:3:6/Anyone who remains in him does not keep on sinning. Anyone who keeps on sinning has neither seen him nor known him.
62:3:7/Dear children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous.
62:3:8/The one who commits sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose: to destroy the works of the devil.
62:3:9/No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
62:3:10/By this it is evident who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.
62:3:11/This is the message you heard from the beginning: we should love one another.
62:3:12/Not like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous.
62:3:13/Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.
62:3:14/We know that we have passed from death to life because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.
62:3:15/Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.
62:3:16/This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
62:3:17/If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
62:3:18/Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.
62:3:19/This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:
62:3:20/If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.
62:3:21/Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God.
62:3:22/And whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him.
62:3:23/And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.
62:3:24/Whoever keeps his commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.
62:4:1/Dear friends, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have spread throughout the world.
62:4:2/This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
62:4:3/And any spirit that does not acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and is already in the world now.
62:4:4/You belong to God, my little ones, and have defeated them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
62:4:5/They belong to the world; that's why they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them.
62:4:6/We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
62:4:7/Dear friends, let's love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
62:4:8/Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
62:4:9/God's love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him.
62:4:10/This is what love is: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to atone for our sins.
62:4:11/Dear friends, if God loved us this much, we also ought to love one another.
62:4:12/No one has ever seen God. But if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is made complete in us.
62:4:13/This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us his Spirit.
62:4:14/And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
62:4:15/Anyone who confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they in God.
62:4:16/And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love, and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.
62:4:17/This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.
62:4:18/There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
62:4:19/We love because he first loved us.
62:4:20/If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates their brother or sister, they are lying. For anyone who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.
62:4:21/And we have this command from him: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.
62:5:1/Anyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the parent also loves the child.
62:5:2/We know we love God's children when we love God and obey his commands.
62:5:3/Loving God means keeping his commands, and his commands aren't burdensome.
62:5:4/Anyone born of God conquers the world, and our faith is the victory that conquers the world.
62:5:5/Who can conquer the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
62:5:6/This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with water only but with water and blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
62:5:7/There are three that testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.
62:5:8/And there are three that testify on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three are in agreement.
62:5:9/If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is greater, because it is the testimony God has given about his Son.
62:5:10/Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in their heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.
62:5:11/And this testimony is that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
62:5:12/Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
62:5:13/I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know you have eternal life.
62:5:14/This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
62:5:15/And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.
62:5:16/If anyone sees a brother or sister committing a sin that does not lead to death, they should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.
62:5:17/All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
62:5:18/We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.
62:5:19/We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.
62:5:20/We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true one. And we are in the true one, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
62:5:21/Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.
63:1:1/The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I deeply love in truth; and it's not just me, but also everyone who knows the truth,
63:1:2/Because of the truth that lives in us and will be with us forever.
63:1:3/May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in a spirit of truth and love.
63:1:4/I was overjoyed to find some of your children living in truth, following the command we received from the Father.
63:1:5/And now I ask you, dear lady, not as though I'm writing a new commandment to you, but the one we have had from the start, that we love one another.
63:1:6/And love means living according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, you must live by it.
63:1:7/Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.
63:1:8/Be careful, so that we don't lose what we have worked for, but that we may be fully rewarded.
63:1:9/Anyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
63:1:10/If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not welcome them into your home or wish them well.
63:1:11/Because wishing them well makes you a partner in their wicked works.
63:1:12/Though I have much to write to you, I don't want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
63:1:13/The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. Amen.
64:1:1/The elder to the dearly loved Gaius, whom I love sincerely.
64:1:2/Dear friend, I hope above everything that you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul is thriving.
64:1:3/I was overjoyed when some friends arrived and shared how you live in the truth.
64:1:4/Nothing makes me happier than hearing that my children are living in truth.
64:1:5/Dear friend, you are faithful in what you do for the brothers and sisters, even when they are strangers to you.
64:1:6/They have told the church about your love. Please help them to continue their journey in a way that honors God.
64:1:7/They set out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from non-believers.
64:1:8/So we should support people like them, to be co-workers for the truth.
64:1:9/I have written to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge us.
64:1:10/So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers and sisters, stops those who want to do so, and expels them from the church.
64:1:11/Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does good is from God; anyone who does evil has not seen God.
64:1:12/Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know our testimony is true.
64:1:13/I had much to write to you, but I prefer not to do so with pen and ink.
64:1:14/But I hope to see you soon, and we can talk face to face. Peace to you. Our friends send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
65:1:1/Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are made holy by God the Father, kept safe in Jesus Christ, and called:
65:1:2/May mercy, peace, and love be greatly increased among you.
65:1:3/Dear friends, while I was very eager to write to you about our shared salvation, I felt it necessary to urge you to fight passionately for the faith that was once handed down to all the saints.
65:1:4/Some people have sneaked in among you unnoticed—people who were long ago designated for this condemnation. They are godless, turning the grace of our God into a license for immorality and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65:1:5/I want to remind you, though you already know this, that the Lord, after saving the people from the land of Egypt, later destroyed those who did not believe.
65:1:6/And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
65:1:7/In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires. They serve as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
65:1:8/In the same way, these dreamers pollute their own bodies, reject authority, and slander celestial beings.
65:1:9/But even Michael the archangel, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said, "The Lord rebuke you."
65:1:10/Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.
65:1:11/Woe to them! They have taken the path of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.
65:1:12/These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead.
65:1:13/They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
65:1:14/Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied about them: "Look, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
65:1:15/to judge everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65:1:16/These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
65:1:17/But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
65:1:18/They said to you, "In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires."
65:1:19/These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
65:1:20/But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
65:1:21/keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
65:1:22/Be merciful to those who doubt;
65:1:23/save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
65:1:24/To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy,
65:1:25/to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.
66:1:1/The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show his servants what must soon take place; and he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John:
66:1:2/Who testified to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, including everything he saw.
66:1:3/Blessed is the one who reads aloud, and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep what is written in it; for the time is near.
66:1:4/John to the seven churches in Asia: Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits before his throne;
66:1:5/And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first to rise from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
66:1:6/And has made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
66:1:7/Look, he is coming with the clouds; and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all tribes of the earth will mourn because of him. So it is to be. Amen.
66:1:8/I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.
66:1:9/I, John, your brother and partner in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66:1:10/I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
66:1:11/Saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last. And, What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches in Asia; to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
66:1:12/And when I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, I saw seven golden lampstands;
66:1:13/And among the lampstands was someone like the Son of Man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
66:1:14/His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire;
66:1:15/His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
66:1:16/In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
66:1:17/When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said, "Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last.
66:1:18/I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
66:1:19/Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later;
66:1:20/The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66:2:1/To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write: The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands says this;
66:2:2/I'm aware of your actions, your hard work, and your endurance. I know you can't tolerate evil people. You've tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have exposed them as liars.
66:2:3/You've persevered, shown patience, worked hard for my name, and haven't grown weary.
66:2:4/However, I have something against you: you have abandoned the love you had at first.
66:2:5/Remember how far you have fallen; repent and do the things you did at first. If not, I will come to you soon and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
66:2:6/But you do have this: you hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66:2:7/Let anyone who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
66:2:8/And to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write: The First and the Last, who died and came to life, says this;
66:2:9/I know your deeds, your hard times, and your poverty—yet you are rich. I am aware of the slander by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66:2:10/Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will face persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66:2:11/Let anyone who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who overcomes will not be harmed by the second death.
66:2:12/And to the angel of the church in Pergamum, write: The one who has the sharp two-edged sword says this;
66:2:13/I know where you live—where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold fast to my name and did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.
66:2:14/Yet, I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols, and to practice sexual immorality.
66:2:15/So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.
66:2:16/Repent; otherwise, I will come to you soon and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
66:2:17/Let anyone who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.
66:2:18/And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write: The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and feet like burnished bronze, says this;
66:2:19/I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
66:2:20/However, I have this against you: you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
66:2:21/I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.
66:2:22/Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of her works.
66:2:23/And I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your deeds.
66:2:24/But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden.
66:2:25/Only hold on to what you have until I come.
66:2:26/To the one who overcomes and keeps my works until the end, I will give authority over the nations.
66:2:27/He will rule them with an iron scepter; he will dash them to pieces like pottery—just as I have received authority from my Father.
66:2:28/And I will give him the morning star.
66:2:29/Let anyone who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:3:1/Write to the angel of the church in Sardis: The one who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says this: I know your actions, that you have a reputation for being alive, but you are actually dead.
66:3:2/Stay alert and strengthen what remains, which is about to die, for I have found your deeds incomplete in the sight of God.
66:3:3/Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold it tight and turn back. If you don't stay alert, I will come like a thief, and you won't know when I will arrive.
66:3:4/Yet in Sardis, there are a few who haven't soiled their clothes; they will walk with me in white, for they are deserving.
66:3:5/The one who conquers will be dressed in white clothes; I will never erase his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels.
66:3:6/Anyone with ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:3:7/Write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: The Holy One, the True One, the one who has the key of David, who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one can open, says this:
66:3:8/I know your actions. Look, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. You have little power, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66:3:9/See, I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim they are Jews but are not, but lie—indeed, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you.
66:3:10/Because you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test those who live on the earth.
66:3:11/I am coming quickly. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
66:3:12/The one who conquers, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new name.
66:3:13/Anyone with ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:3:14/Write to the angel of the church in Laodicea: The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the originator of God's creation, says this:
66:3:15/I know your actions, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!
66:3:16/So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
66:3:17/You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.
66:3:18/I advise you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.
66:3:19/Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline. So be earnest and turn back.
66:3:20/Look, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with me.
66:3:21/To the one who conquers, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66:3:22/Anyone with ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:4:1/After this I looked, and there was an open door in heaven: the first voice I heard was like a trumpet speaking to me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this."
66:4:2/And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
66:4:3/The one sitting on the throne shone like jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald.
66:4:4/Surrounding the throne were twenty-four seats, and on the seats, I saw twenty-four elders dressed in white clothes, with golden crowns on their heads.
66:4:5/From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing, which are the seven spirits of God.
66:4:6/In front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and back.
66:4:7/The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a human, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
66:4:8/Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."
66:4:9/Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
66:4:10/The twenty-four elders fall down before the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne, saying,
66:4:11/"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."
66:5:1/And I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
66:5:2/And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming loudly, Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?
66:5:3/And no one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth, could open the book or even look at it.
66:5:4/And I cried a lot, because no one was found worthy to open and read the book, or to look at it.
66:5:5/And one of the elders says to me, Don't cry: look, the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed to open the book and its seven seals.
66:5:6/And I saw, and there, in the center of the throne and the four creatures, and among the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, with seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
66:5:7/And he came and took the book from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
66:5:8/And when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
66:5:9/And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book and to break its seals: for you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation;
66:5:10/And you have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign on the earth.
66:5:11/And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the creatures and the elders: and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;
66:5:12/Saying loudly, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
66:5:13/And every creature in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea, and all that is in them, I heard saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.
66:5:14/And the four creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped him who lives forever and ever.
66:6:1/And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
66:6:2/And I saw, and look, a white horse: and the one sitting on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he set out conquering, and to conquer.
66:6:3/And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
66:6:4/And there went out another horse that was red: and authority was given to the one sitting on it to remove peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and a great sword was given to him.
66:6:5/And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I saw, and look a black horse; and the one sitting on it had a pair of scales in his hand.
66:6:6/And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and make sure you do not harm the oil and the wine.
66:6:7/And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
66:6:8/And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
66:6:9/And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
66:6:10/And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
66:6:11/And white robes were given to each of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest a little while longer, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, who were to be killed as they were, should be completed.
66:6:12/And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal, and, look, there was a great earthquake; and the sun turned black like sackcloth made of hair, and the moon became like blood;
66:6:13/And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, just as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind.
66:6:14/And the sky receded like a scroll being rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved from their places.
66:6:15/And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;
66:6:16/And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the one sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
66:6:17/For the great day of his wrath has come; and who can stand?
66:7:1/After this, I saw four angels standing at the earth's four corners, holding back the four winds so that no wind would blow on the earth, the sea, or any tree.
66:7:2/Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. He shouted to the four angels who had the power to harm the earth and the sea,
66:7:3/"Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have placed a seal on the foreheads of God's servants."
66:7:4/And I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.
66:7:5/From the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Reuben, 12,000. From the tribe of Gad, 12,000.
66:7:6/From the tribe of Asher, 12,000. From the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000. From the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000.
66:7:7/From the tribe of Simeon, 12,000. From the tribe of Levi, 12,000. From the tribe of Issachar, 12,000.
66:7:8/From the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000. From the tribe of Joseph, 12,000. From the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000.
66:7:9/After this, I saw a vast crowd, too large to count, from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.
66:7:10/And they shouted, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."
66:7:11/All the angels were standing around the throne, along with the elders and the four living creatures. They fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66:7:12/Saying, "Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen."
66:7:13/Then one of the elders asked me, "Who are these in white robes, and where did they come from?"
66:7:14/I answered, "Sir, you know." And he told me, "These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66:7:15/That's why they are before God's throne and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will shelter them with His presence.
66:7:16/They will no longer be hungry or thirsty; the sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.
66:7:17/For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; He will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66:8:1/When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66:8:2/I saw the seven angels who stand before God; they were given seven trumpets.
66:8:3/Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; he was given a lot of incense to offer along with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar in front of the throne.
66:8:4/The smoke of the incense, mixed with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the angel's hand.
66:8:5/The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it onto the earth: there were voices, thunder, lightning, and an earthquake.
66:8:6/The seven angels with the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.
66:8:7/The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down to the earth. A third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
66:8:8/The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain ablaze with fire was thrown into the sea: a third of the sea turned into blood;
66:8:9/A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66:8:10/The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water;
66:8:11/The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters because they had become bitter.
66:8:12/The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
66:8:13/I looked, and heard an angel flying through the sky, shouting loudly, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!"
66:9:1/And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven to earth: and he was given the key to the abyss.
66:9:2/He opened the abyss, and smoke rose from it like the smoke from a massive furnace; the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke.
66:9:3/From the smoke, locusts descended upon the earth, and they were given power like that of earth's scorpions.
66:9:4/They were instructed not to harm the grass, any plant, or any tree, but only those people who did not have God's seal on their foreheads.
66:9:5/They were allowed not to kill them but to torment them for five months; and their torment was like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a person.
66:9:6/During those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.
66:9:7/The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle; on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.
66:9:8/Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.
66:9:9/They wore armor like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
66:9:10/They had tails and stings like scorpions, and their power was to harm people for five months.
66:9:11/They had a king over them, the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.
66:9:12/The first woe has passed; behold, two more woes are still to come.
66:9:13/And the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,
66:9:14/Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
66:9:15/And the four angels who had been prepared for this moment, day, month, and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
66:9:16/The number of mounted troops was two hundred million; I heard their number.
66:9:17/In the vision, I saw the horses and their riders wearing breastplates of fiery red, dark blue, and sulfur yellow; the heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.
66:9:18/A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues—by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths.
66:9:19/For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, with heads, and with them they inflict injury.
66:9:20/And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk.
66:9:21/Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality, or their thefts.
66:10:1/I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.
66:10:2/He held a small, open book in his hand. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.
66:10:3/He shouted loudly, like a roaring lion. When he shouted, seven thunders spoke out.
66:10:4/After the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write down what they said, but I heard a voice from heaven instructing me, "Keep secret what the seven thunders said and do not write it down."
66:10:5/The angel I saw standing on the sea and the land raised his hand toward heaven.
66:10:6/He swore by the eternal one who created the heavens, everything in them, the earth, everything on it, and the sea, everything in it, declaring that there would be no more delay.
66:10:7/But when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, God's mystery will be completed, just as He announced to His prophets.
66:10:8/Then the voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go, take the open book from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land."
66:10:9/I approached the angel and asked him for the small book. He told me, "Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but in your mouth, it will be as sweet as honey."
66:10:10/I took the small book from the angel's hand and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.
66:10:11/He then told me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
66:11:1/I was given a measuring rod that looked like a staff, and the angel stood by, saying, "Get up and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.
66:11:2/But exclude the outer court of the temple; do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
66:11:3/I will empower my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth."
66:11:4/These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66:11:5/If anyone tries to harm them, fire flows from their mouths and consumes their enemies. If anyone tries to harm them, they must be killed in this way.
66:11:6/They have the power to shut the sky so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire.
66:11:7/When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will wage war against them, overcome them, and kill them.
66:11:8/Their bodies will lie in the main street of the great city, which symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
66:11:9/People from different peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will gaze at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their bodies to be placed in a tomb.
66:11:10/Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate, sending gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented those living on the earth.
66:11:11/But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet; and terror struck those who saw them.
66:11:12/Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.
66:11:13/At that very hour there was a severe earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66:11:14/The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
66:11:15/Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of the world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign forever and ever."
66:11:16/And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66:11:17/Saying, "We thank you, Lord God Almighty, who is, and who was, and who is to come, because you have taken your great power and begun to reign.
66:11:18/The nations were enraged, but your wrath has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and to reward your servants the prophets, the saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
66:11:19/And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and severe hail.
66:12:1/Then a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
66:12:2/And she was pregnant, crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth.
66:12:3/Another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.
66:12:4/His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born.
66:12:5/She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.
66:12:6/The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
66:12:7/Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
66:12:8/But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.
66:12:9/The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
66:12:10/Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
66:12:11/They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
66:12:12/Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short."
66:12:13/When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66:12:14/The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach.
66:12:15/Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.
66:12:16/But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
66:12:17/Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God's commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
66:13:1/I stood on the seashore and saw a beast rise from the sea with seven heads and ten horns, and on its horns were ten crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.
66:13:2/The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but it had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion. The dragon gave it his power, throne, and great authority.
66:13:3/One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but the deadly wound was healed. The whole world was amazed and followed the beast.
66:13:4/People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast, asking, "Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?"
66:13:5/The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.
66:13:6/It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, slandering his name, his dwelling place, and those who live in heaven.
66:13:7/It was allowed to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them. It was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.
66:13:8/All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.
66:13:9/Let anyone who has ears listen.
66:13:10/If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed. This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God's people.
66:13:11/Then I saw another beast coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.
66:13:12/It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.
66:13:13/And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of the people.
66:13:14/Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
66:13:15/The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.
66:13:16/It forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,
66:13:17/so that no one could buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
66:13:18/Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six.
66:14:1/And I looked, and there, a Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand, having his Father’s name written on their foreheads.
66:14:2/And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud thunder: and I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.
66:14:3/And they sang what seemed to be a new song before the throne, and before the four creatures, and the elders: and no one could learn that song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.
66:14:4/These are the ones who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from humanity, being the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
66:14:5/And no deceit was found in their mouths: for they are blameless before the throne of God.
66:14:6/And I saw another angel flying through the sky, having the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people,
66:14:7/Saying in a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the time of his judgment has come: and worship him who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the springs of water.
66:14:8/And another angel followed, saying, Babylon has fallen, has fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her immorality.
66:14:9/And the third angel followed them, saying in a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on their forehead, or on their hand,
66:14:10/They will drink of the wine of God's wrath, which is poured out full strength into the cup of his anger; and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
66:14:11/And the smoke of their torment rises forever and ever: and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and anyone who receives the mark of his name.
66:14:12/This calls for the endurance of the saints: here are those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
66:14:13/And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on: Yes, says the Spirit, so they may rest from their labors; and their deeds follow them.
66:14:14/And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
66:14:15/And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time has come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
66:14:16/And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
66:14:17/And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
66:14:18/And another angel came out from the altar, who had authority over fire; and cried with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
66:14:19/And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
66:14:20/And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress, up to the horse bridles, for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.
66:15:1/And I saw another sign in heaven, amazing and wonderful, seven angels holding the seven final plagues; because with them, God's wrath is fully realized.
66:15:2/And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire: and those who had triumphed over the beast, its image, its mark, and the number of its name, standing on the sea of glass, holding God's harps.
66:15:3/And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Your works are incredible and marvelous, Lord God Almighty; your ways are just and true, you King of the saints."
66:15:4/Who wouldn't fear you, O Lord, and honor your name? For you alone are holy: all nations will come and bow down before you; because your judgments are revealed.
66:15:5/And after that, I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
66:15:6/And the seven angels emerged from the temple, carrying the seven plagues, dressed in pure and white linen, and with golden sashes around their chests.
66:15:7/And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
66:15:8/And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one could enter the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
66:16:1/And I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out the bowls of God's wrath on the earth."
66:16:2/The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and painful and terrible sores appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped its image.
66:16:3/The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea; and it turned into blood like that of a dead person: and every living thing in the sea died.
66:16:4/The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and they turned into blood.
66:16:5/And I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are just, O Lord, the One who is, who was, and who is to come, because You have made these judgments.
66:16:6/Because they have spilled the blood of saints and prophets, You have given them blood to drink; they deserve it."
66:16:7/And I heard another voice from the altar say, "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are Your judgments."
66:16:8/The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun; and it was allowed to scorch people with fire.
66:16:9/People were scorched by intense heat, and they cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify Him.
66:16:10/The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast; and its kingdom was plunged into darkness; and people gnawed their tongues in agony,
66:16:11/And cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, yet they did not turn from their evil actions.
66:16:12/The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
66:16:13/And I saw three impure spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
66:16:14/For they are demonic spirits performing signs, who go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
66:16:15/"Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps their clothes on, so they don't walk around naked and expose their shame."
66:16:16/And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
66:16:17/The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is finished."
66:16:18/And there were voices, thunderings, and lightnings; and there was a massive earthquake, such as had not occurred since humans were on the earth, so powerful and so great.
66:16:19/And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed: and great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.
66:16:20/And every island disappeared, and the mountains could not be found.
66:16:21/And huge hailstones, about the weight of a talent, fell from heaven on people, and people cursed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague was extremely severe.
66:17:1/Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me. He said, "Come here; I will show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters."
66:17:2/She with whom the kings of the earth have engaged in sexual immorality, and the inhabitants of the earth have been intoxicated with the wine of her immorality.
66:17:3/He transported me in the spirit to a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
66:17:4/The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand filled with detestable things and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
66:17:5/And on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
66:17:6/I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I was utterly amazed.
66:17:7/Then the angel said to me, "Why are you amazed? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
66:17:8/The beast you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the abyss and go to destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will marvel when they see the beast, because it was, and is not, and yet will come.
66:17:9/This calls for a mind with wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
66:17:10/There are also seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain for only a little while.
66:17:11/And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and he goes to destruction.
66:17:12/The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings for one hour along with the beast.
66:17:13/These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.
66:17:14/They will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are called, chosen, and faithful."
66:17:15/Then he said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
66:17:16/And the ten horns you saw on the beast, they will hate the prostitute, make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh, and burn her up with fire.
66:17:17/For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose by being of one mind and handing over their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
66:17:18/And the woman you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth."
66:18:1/After these events, I saw another angel descending from heaven, endowed with immense power; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
66:18:2/He shouted with a powerful voice, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, and has become a dwelling for demons, a haunt for every foul spirit, and a prison for every unclean and detested bird."
66:18:3/For all nations have indulged in the intoxicating wrath of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have engaged in immorality with her, while the merchants of the earth grew wealthy from her excessive luxuries.
66:18:4/Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Leave her, my people, so you won't share in her sins, or suffer from her plagues."
66:18:5/Her sins have piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her wrongdoings.
66:18:6/Pay her back as she has paid others, and repay her twice as much for her deeds; in the cup she has filled, pour double for her.
66:18:7/As much as she has glorified herself and indulged in luxury, give her an equal measure of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, 'I sit as a queen, I am not a widow, and I will never see sorrow.'
66:18:8/Therefore, her plagues will come in a single day—death, mourning, and famine—and she will be completely consumed by fire. For strong is the Lord God who judges her.
66:18:9/And the kings of the earth, who have engaged in immorality and indulged in luxury with her, will weep and mourn for her when they see the smoke of her burning,
66:18:10/Standing at a distance for fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city Babylon, the mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'
66:18:11/And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their goods anymore:
66:18:12/The goods of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles made of ivory, all kinds of articles made of costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble,
66:18:13/And cinnamon, spices, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and bodies and souls of people.
66:18:14/The fruits your soul longed for have gone from you, and all your delicacies and splendors have vanished, never to be found again.
66:18:15/The merchants of these goods, who gained wealth from her, will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
66:18:16/And saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls!
66:18:17/For in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste.' And every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance,
66:18:18/And cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What city was like this great city!'
66:18:19/And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, where all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth! For in one hour she has been devastated.'
66:18:20/Celebrate over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has executed your judgment on her.
66:18:21/Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "With such violence, the great city Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again.
66:18:22/And the sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again; no craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again; and the sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again;
66:18:23/And the light of a lamp will never shine in you again; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. For your merchants were the world's important people; by your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
66:18:24/And in her was found the blood of prophets, saints, and all who have been slain on the earth."
66:19:1/After these events, I heard a loud voice of many people in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah; Salvation, glory, honor, and power belong to our Lord God:
66:19:2/For his judgments are true and just: he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
66:19:3/And again they said, "Hallelujah." And her smoke rose up forever and ever.
66:19:4/And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, "Amen; Hallelujah."
66:19:5/And a voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all his servants, and those who fear him, both small and great."
66:19:6/And I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting, "Hallelujah: for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
66:19:7/Let's be joyful and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready."
66:19:8/And she was given fine linen to wear, bright and clean: for the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.
66:19:9/And he said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb.'" And he said to me, "These are the true words of God."
66:19:10/And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "Don't do that: I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66:19:11/And I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse; and the one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and wages war in righteousness.
66:19:12/His eyes were like blazing fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no one knows but himself.
66:19:13/And he is dressed in a robe dipped in blood: and his name is known as The Word of God.
66:19:14/And the armies in heaven followed him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
66:19:15/And from his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to strike down the nations: and he will rule them with an iron scepter: and he treads the winepress of the fury and wrath of Almighty God.
66:19:16/And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
66:19:17/And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying in midheaven, "Come and gather for the great feast of God;
66:19:18/So that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, small and great."
66:19:19/And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the one sitting on the horse and against his army.
66:19:20/And the beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs on its behalf, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. Both were thrown alive into a fiery lake of burning sulfur.
66:19:21/And the rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the one sitting on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
66:20:1/And I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding the key to the abyss and a massive chain in his hand.
66:20:2/He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and tied him up for a thousand years,
66:20:3/And threw him into the abyss, locked it, and sealed it over him, to prevent him from misleading the nations anymore until the thousand years were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.
66:20:4/And I observed thrones, and those seated on them were granted authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been executed for their testimony about Jesus and for proclaiming God's word, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not accepted its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years.
66:20:5/But the rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were over. This is the first resurrection.
66:20:6/Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
66:20:7/And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,
66:20:8/And will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea.
66:20:9/They advanced across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.
66:20:10/And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66:20:11/And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.
66:20:12/And I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
66:20:13/And the sea gave up the dead within it, and death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and each person was judged according to their deeds.
66:20:14/And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
66:20:15/And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
66:21:1/And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away; and there was no more sea.
66:21:2/And I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
66:21:3/And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
66:21:4/And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain: for the old order of things has passed away.
66:21:5/And the one seated on the throne said, "Look, I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
66:21:6/And he said to me, "It is finished. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
66:21:7/The one who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my child.
66:21:8/But the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, idolaters, and all liars will have their place in the lake of fire and sulfur. This is the second death."
66:21:9/Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66:21:10/And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
66:21:11/With the glory of God: its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
66:21:12/It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel:
66:21:13/On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
66:21:14/And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66:21:15/And the one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
66:21:16/The city was laid out in a square, its length equal to its width. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.
66:21:17/He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel's measurement.
66:21:18/The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
66:21:19/The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
66:21:20/The fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
66:21:21/And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.
66:21:22/And I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
66:21:23/The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
66:21:24/The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.
66:21:25/Its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there.
66:21:26/They will bring the splendor and honor of the nations into it.
66:21:27/Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
66:22:1/He showed me a pure river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
66:22:2/Right down the middle of the street and on both sides of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, producing its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for healing the nations.
66:22:3/There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will serve him.
66:22:4/They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66:22:5/There will be no more night; they won't need the light of a lamp or the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign forever and ever.
66:22:6/He said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place."
66:22:7/"Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."
66:22:8/I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me.
66:22:9/But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"
66:22:10/Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.
66:22:11/Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy."
66:22:12/"Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done.
66:22:13/I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
66:22:14/Blessed are those who do his commandments, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city through its gates.
66:22:15/Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66:22:16/I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."
66:22:17/The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let the one who hears say, "Come!" Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.
66:22:18/I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book.
66:22:19/And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
66:22:20/He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
66:22:21/May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
